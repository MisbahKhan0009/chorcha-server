Increased tourism to sensitive areas without proper planning and marfagement can actually harm the ecosystem and its species because the infrastructure needed to sustain tourism such as roads can contribute to environmental degradation.\nEcotourism is also said by critics to have a negative impact on local communities because the arrival of foreign visitors and wealth can shift political and economic conditions of the area. It can also make the area dependent more on tourism than its domestic economic practices.\nWhile ecotourism becomes popular, we must however, remain cautious about its adverse effects and do our best to protect the environment and ecosystem.\n1.

(One is done for you)\nMeditation in our time is practiced by people to reduce stress and tension, and improve focus. There are trainers who help beginners with some exercises such as improved breathing and progressive relaxation. One of the most common approaches to meditation is concentration. To develop concentration one needs to focus on a single point. Since focusing the mind is challenging, a beginner might meditate for only a few minutes and then work up to longer durations. Meditation releases anxiety and brings a state of calmness. It increases the thinking ability of human brain so that people have a better control of their emotions. Those who practice meditation can work tirelessly for a longer period of time. Meditation helps improve blood circulation in the brain and other parts of the body. Finally, meditation improves creativity, self-awareness and tolerance.\n1. To reduce stress and tension, and improve focus →2 → 3 → 4→5 →6",

He gave a balloon to each attendee. Each one was asked to write his/her name on it using a market pen. He then collected all the balloons and put them in another room. He then took all the attendees to the room and asked them to find the balloon with their name, colliding with each other, pushing around others and there was utter chaos.\n\nAt the end of five minutes, no one could find their own balloon. Now the speaker asked each one to randomly collect a balloon and give it to the person whose name was written on it. Within minutes everyone had their own balloon.\n\nThe speaker then began, \"This is happening in our lives. Everyone is frantically looking for happiness, not knowing where it is. Our happiness lies in the happiness of other people. Give them their happiness, you will get your own happiness. And this is the purpose of human life - the pursuit of happiness.\"",

          "explanation": "The pie chart displays the various sources of air pollution in a city, highlighting five key contributors. Vehicles are by far the most significant source, accounting for 60% of total air pollution. This indicates a heavy reliance on private and commercial transportation, possibly due to limited public transport infrastructure. Industry is the second-largest contributor at 18% , reflecting emissions from factories and manufacturing units. Power plants contribute 13% , suggesting that electricity generation—likely from fossil fuels—is another major pollutant. Waste disposal activities are responsible for 3% , while heating or using gas contributes nothing ( 0% ), showing negligible or highly controlled emissions in that category.\nThe disparity is stark: vehicles alone contribute more than all other sources combined, underscoring the urgent need for cleaner transport alternatives and stricter vehicular emission controls. In contrast, waste disposal and gas usage have a minimal impact, suggesting these are not major areas of concern. Targeted interventions in transport and industry could significantly improve air quality."

He asked Asha to keep an eye on the vessels for about ten to fifteen minutes while the three ingredients in three separate vessels boiled.\nAfter the said time, he asked Asha to peel the potato and egg, and strain the tea leaves. Asha was left puzzled. She understood her father was trying to explain her something, but she didn't know what it was. Her father explained, \"All three items were put in the same circumstances. See how they've responded differently.\" He said that the potato turned soft, the egg turned hard, and the tea leaves changed the colour and taste of the water. He further said, \"We are all like one of these items. When adversity calls, we respond exactly the way they do. Now, are you a potato, an egg, or tea leaves? You have to decide that.\" Her father was a wise man and he tried to explain a lesson of life to his daughter with live demonstrations.\nSector-9, Uttara, Dhaka\n1 March 2025"

          "explanation": "Feni\n04.07.2024\nDear Mijanur,\nHey! How are things going at college? I'm writing to you today because I wanted to talk about something important – reading newspapers.\nI know you might not be a big fan of sitting down with a physical paper these days, but trust me, there are a lot of benefits to be had from this \"old-fashioned\" habit.\nFirstly, newspapers keep you informed. They give you a well-rounded view of current events, both locally and internationally. It's important to stay up-to-date on what's happening in the world, not just through social media, which can be filled with rumors and biased opinions. Newspapers offer a more reliable source of information.\nSecondly, reading newspapers improves your vocabulary and communication skills. They're full of rich, descriptive language, and you'll be exposed to new words and writing styles. This can definitely help you improve your own writing and speaking abilities.\nThirdly, newspapers challenge your mind and keep it sharp. Reading articles on various topics, from politics and science to sports and entertainment, engages your brain in a different way. It's a good mental exercise and helps you stay mentally stimulated.\nFinally, newspapers can even introduce you to new interests. You might stumble upon an article about something you never knew existed, sparking a new passion or hobby.\nI know you're busy with classes and other activities, but even just skimming through the headlines or reading a few articles a day can make a big difference. Maybe there's a section you'd find particularly interesting, like sports or technology? You could even consider subscribing to a digital version of a newspaper for easier access.\nGive it a try, [Brother's Name]! I think you might be surprised at how much you learn and enjoy it.\nLet me know what you think if you decide to check it out.\nBest,\nHarun"
