          "explanation": "Feni\n04.07.2024\nDear Mijanur,\nHey! How are things going at college? I'm writing to you today because I wanted to talk about something important – reading newspapers.\nI know you might not be a big fan of sitting down with a physical paper these days, but trust me, there are a lot of benefits to be had from this \"old-fashioned\" habit.\nFirstly, newspapers keep you informed. They give you a well-rounded view of current events, both locally and internationally. It's important to stay up-to-date on what's happening in the world, not just through social media, which can be filled with rumors and biased opinions. Newspapers offer a more reliable source of information.\nSecondly, reading newspapers improves your vocabulary and communication skills. They're full of rich, descriptive language, and you'll be exposed to new words and writing styles. This can definitely help you improve your own writing and speaking abilities.\nThirdly, newspapers challenge your mind and keep it sharp. Reading articles on various topics, from politics and science to sports and entertainment, engages your brain in a different way. It's a good mental exercise and helps you stay mentally stimulated.\nFinally, newspapers can even introduce you to new interests. You might stumble upon an article about something you never knew existed, sparking a new passion or hobby.\nI know you're busy with classes and other activities, but even just skimming through the headlines or reading a few articles a day can make a big difference. Maybe there's a section you'd find particularly interesting, like sports or technology? You could even consider subscribing to a digital version of a newspaper for easier access.\nGive it a try, [Brother's Name]! I think you might be surprised at how much you learn and enjoy it.\nLet me know what you think if you decide to check it out.\nBest,\nHarun"

He groomed himself up as a young man who earned success by dint of perseverance and commitment. When the Pakistan military began its genocide in Bangladesh, he joined the Liberation War and received military training at Camp Murtee located at the Himalayan foothills in India. The tall young man who carried himself with dignity and possessed remarkable traits of leadership became the ADC of General Ataul Goni, Osmani, the Commander in Chief of Bangladesh Armed Forces during the Liberation War. After Independence, Sheikh Kamal could, easily remain in Bangladesh Army and pass a secure life but he preferred to engage himself in country building and organizing the young forces to that end, Journalist Syed Ishtiaq Rezi in one of his columns 'Ekjon Sheikh Kamal' in Bangla Tribune rightly says that the unique qualities of Sheikh Kamal's character, especially his wholehearted involvement in sports and culture are never seen in any son or daughter of any President, Prime Minister or High Officials in Bangladesh.",

      "uddipok": "Write a summary of the following passage.\nEducation aims to bring about positive changes in our behavior. It helps us try to change our lives as well as the society we live in. Education that does not illuminate our minds or does not inspire us to work for the community is not complete at all. Education is not all about getting grades or receiving certificates- we use education to make life better. We are expected to apply the knowledge, skills and values that we learn in a classroom in our engagement with the world that lies outside. And we can do so in many different ways. Let's have a look at how education works. Learners' civic engagement is highly appreciated all over the world. Civic engagement means working to make a difference in the civic life (the public life of the citizens as constructed with private or personal life) of the community using knowledge, skills, values and motivation. Civic engagement promotes the quality of life in a community by contributing to the improvement of health and wellbeing of the people.\nCivically engaged individuals recognize themselves as members of a larger social community and are concerned about civic issues. They consider themselves responsible citizens who take action or raise their voices against injustice, discrimination and other forms of social ills.\nIn civic engagement, issues of public concern are crucial. Civic engagement includes individual or group activities to protect public interests and change the way the community values itself. For example, If you are protesting against any unjust decision of the local municipality such as raising taxes or an act that might work against people's interests, you are civically engaged and your action is considered a civic engagement. This protest can be done in different ways such as organizing rallies, collecting signatures, making human chains, writing petitions, etc. You can also help control traffic in front of a school, help children to cross the roads, work in a team to clean a park or a sea beach. You can also give some services to elderly people. These are all examples of civic engagement as what you do directly affects the community.\nWhen civic engagement is a part of an academic program, and the learners' engagement is assessed following a scale, then it is called service learning. It involves the application of knowledge and skills learned in the classroom and then making a complete plan of action 1.e. preparing a budget, starting the process of implementation, involving people and activating operational strategies.",
