          "explanation": "The given graph demonstates the percentage of people who are living below the poverty line from 2005 to 2020. The chart includes a comparative study of rural area and urban one. In 2005, 35% of people were living below the poverty line in rural area whereas it was 21% in urban one. Unfortunately, the number increased for both areas in 2010, when 45% were living below the poverty line in rural area and 30% in urban area. Then in 2015 the percentage with a little fall comes down to 32 and 25 for rural and urban area respectively. Additionally, the percentage went lower in 2020, 28% of people were living below poverty line in rural area and 20% in urban area. So, we learn from the chart that the living standard of the people were the lowest in 2010 as it had the largest number of f people living below the poverty line."

          "explanation": "The Proud Frog and the Pond\nOnce upon a time, there was a pond full of frogs. As it was during the rainy season, it was filled to the brim with water. Many frogs took shelter in the pond, jumping, playing, and croaking all day long. The pond was lively and cheerful.\nAmong them was a proud frog who believed he was the biggest and strongest of all. He would often boast about his strength and size to the other frogs, claiming that he could defeat any creature that came near the pond.\nOne day, a group of travelers passed by the pond with a large ox. The frogs curiously peeked from the water to see the huge animal. The proud frog, seeing the ox, felt his pride hurt. “That creature may be big,” he said loudly, “but I can be just as big if I want to!”\nHe began puffing himself up. “Look! Am I as big as that ox now?” he asked the other frogs.\n“No, not yet,” replied the frogs.\nThe proud frog puffed himself up even more. “Now?”\n“Still not as big,” they said.\nAngry and determined, the proud frog puffed and puffed, trying to become as large as the ox. But in his foolish attempt, he puffed so much that his body couldn’t handle it. With a loud pop! , he burst and died on the spot.\nAll the other frogs were shocked and saddened. They had tried to warn him, but his pride had made him blind to reason.\nMoral: Pride and envy can lead to one's downfall. Be content with who you are and never try to be someone you're not.\n"

          "explanation": "Subject: Importance of Responsible Social Media Sharing\nDear [Younger Brother/Sister's Name],\nI hope this letter finds you well. As your older sibling, I feel it's important to share some advice regarding your social media activities, particularly concerning the sharing of news articles and information.\nIn today's digital age, social media has become a powerful tool for communication and information sharing. While it offers numerous benefits, it also comes with certain responsibilities. One of these responsibilities is ensuring that the information we share is accurate, reliable, and credible.\nI've noticed that lately, you've been sharing a lot of news articles and stories on your social media accounts without verifying their authenticity. While I understand the urge to stay informed and share interesting content with your friends and followers, it's crucial to remember that not everything you come across on the internet is true.\nSharing fake or baseless news can have serious consequences. Not only does it contribute to the spread of misinformation, but it can also harm the reputations of individuals and organizations unfairly targeted by false claims. Moreover, it can fuel unnecessary panic and confusion among people who may believe the misinformation to be true.\nBefore sharing any news article or story on your social media accounts, I urge you to take a moment to verify its credibility. Look for reliable sources, cross-check the information with other reputable news outlets, and consider the context in which the story is presented. If you're unsure about the accuracy of a particular piece of news, it's better to refrain from sharing it altogether.\nRemember that as a member of the online community, you have the power to influence others with the content you share. By being mindful of the information you share and prioritizing accuracy and credibility, you can contribute to a more informed and responsible digital environment.\nIf you ever come across news or information that you're unsure about, don't hesitate to reach out to me or other trusted sources for guidance. Together, we can work towards promoting responsible social media behavior and combating the spread of misinformation.\nThank you for taking the time to read this letter, and please know that I'm always here to offer support and guidance whenever you need it.\nTake care, and I look forward to seeing you soon.\nWarm regards,\n[Your Name]"

(One has been done for you):\nThe Island of St. Martin is the only coral island in Bangladesh located in the north-eastern part of Bay of Bengal. The roughly flat island is only above 3.6 metre above the sea level. The entire island can be walked about in 3 hours. The island is known for its unique natural beauty with white sandy beaches fringed with coconut palms and a diverse marine life. Due to the expansion of unregulated tourism, the island is facing increasing erosion, contamination of surface and ground water, wildlife displacement, and loss of biodiversity. Other threats include cutting of sand dune vegetation for fuel-wood and hotel establishment; degradation of sand dune habitat; the harvesting of turtle eggs; indiscriminate exploitation of coral resources etc. To address this, the Government has declared some areas of the island as Ecologically Critical Area (ECA), prohibiting unauthorized constructions there.\nOnly coral island in Bangladesh → 2. → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6",
