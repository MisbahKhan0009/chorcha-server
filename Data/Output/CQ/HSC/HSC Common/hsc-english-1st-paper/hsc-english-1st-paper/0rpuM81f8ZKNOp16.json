(One is done for you):\nAccording to some myths and legends, Gazi Pir was a Muslim saint who is said to have spread Islam in the parts of Bengal close to the Sundarbans. He was credited with many miracles. For example, he could supposedly calm dangerous animals and make them docile. He is usually depicted in paats or scroll paintings riding a fierce-looking Bengal tiger, a snake in his hand, but in no apparent danger. According to some stories, he also fought crocodiles who threatened the people of a region full of canals and creeks, indeed, a kind of watery jungle bordering the Bay of Bengal. Because of his alert and vigilant presence, all predatory animals were said to have been kept within bounds. It was also believed that he enabled villagers to live close to forests and jungles and cultivate their lands.\n1. Close to the Sundarbans → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6.",

Increasing enrolment at the secondary and higher secondary level puts pressure on higher educational institutions. But due to limited capacity, only a small number of students may be enrolled in universities. Thus, each year a large number of students are denied access to higher education. Also, due to poverty and increase in educational expenses, students of the lower middle class do not get easy access to higher education. Moreover, those who get places in the universities have limited access to avail all kinds of diversified educational facilities relating to their study fields. Only about 12% of graduates enter higher educational institutions. More than 80% of these students are admitted to NU affiliated colleges. Others are absorbed by the public and private universities. In the last two decades, there has been a substantial rise in the number of students in private universities. According to the UGC Annual Report 2010, the number rose from 88,669 in 2005 to 2,00,752 in 2010.",

          "explanation": "Digital Bangladesh\n\"Digital Bangladesh\" is a visionary initiative launched by the government of Bangladesh to transform the country into a knowledge-based society through the use of information and communication technology (ICT). The concept, introduced by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 2008, aims to harness the power of digital technology to improve various sectors, such as education, healthcare, governance, and business, thereby promoting overall national development. One of the key aspects of Digital Bangladesh is the expansion of internet connectivity across the country, including rural areas, which has enabled millions of people to access information, communicate, and participate in the digital economy.\nThe government has made significant investments in building infrastructure for digital services, including the development of e-governance systems, digital banking, and online education platforms. These initiatives have not only increased the efficiency of public services but have also provided greater transparency and accountability. In education, online learning platforms and digital classrooms have made learning more accessible, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, when schools shifted to virtual classes.\nFurthermore, the rise of the digital economy has created new opportunities for young entrepreneurs in e-commerce, freelancing, and digital marketing. The government's efforts to develop digital skills among the youth through training programs have led to an increase in the number of IT professionals, contributing to the country’s growing tech industry.\nDespite the progress, challenges remain, such as digital literacy gaps, cybersecurity concerns, and the need for further infrastructure development in remote areas. However, the vision of Digital Bangladesh continues to evolve, aiming for an inclusive, technology-driven future for all its citizens."

She had marked the dates on her calendar and spent countless hours imagining herself browsing through the aisles, exploring new titles, and immersing herself in the world of literature. However, her excitement was abruptly interrupted when her parents voiced their concerns about her upcoming exams. They reminded her of the importance of focusing on her studies and cautioned against distractions like the Book Fair. Rima felt a pang of disappointment as she reluctantly agreed to prioritize her studies over her passion for books. Despite her initial disappointment, Rima understood the importance of her education and resolved to channel her enthusiasm into her studies, knowing that the Book Fair would always be there next year. With determination and dedication, she plunged into her books, determined to excel in her exams and pursue her love for literature once her academic responsibilities were fulfilled."

          "explanation": "The graph illustrates the increase in the number of overseas students at universities over a 20-year period, from 2000 to 2020.\nIn 2000, the number of international students was relatively low, just above 200. This figure remained almost unchanged until around 2005, showing a very slow rate of growth. However, after 2005, there was a sharp upward trend. The number of overseas students began to rise rapidly and continued to grow steadily through 2010. By this point, the number had reached around 1000 students.\nFrom 2010 to 2015, the growth began to slow down, although it still maintained an upward trajectory. After 2015, the graph shows a plateau, with student numbers leveling off at around 1100, indicating saturation or stabilization in growth.\nIn summary, the graph depicts a significant rise in the number of international students between 2005 and 2015, followed by a stable period. The overall trend reflects growing global interest in higher education during this time."
