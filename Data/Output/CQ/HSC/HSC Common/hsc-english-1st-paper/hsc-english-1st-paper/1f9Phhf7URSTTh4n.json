She completed her earlier schooling at a local school. She is the first Indian-born woman and the second person in space from this subcontinent. After graduating in Aeronautical Engineering from Punjab Engineering College, Chawla moved to the United States in 1982. She obtained her Master's degree in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Texas. Later she did her PhD in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Colorado.\nDetermined to become an astronaut even in the face of the space shuttle Challenger disaster on 28 January 1986 that led to the deaths of its seven crew members, Chawla joined NASA in 1988. She began working as a Vice-President where she did Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) research on vertical take-off and landing. In 1991, she got U.S. citizenship and started her career as a NASA astronaut in 1995. She was selected for her first flight in 1996. She spoke the following words while travelling in the weightlessness of space. \"You are just your intelligence.\" She had travelled 10.67 million miles, as many as 252 times around the Earth.\nHer first space mission (Mission STS 87) began on 19 November 1997 with six other astronauts on the Space Shuttle Columbia. On her first mission that lasted for 15 days, 16 hours, 34 minutes and 4 seconds, she travelled 6.5 million miles. She was responsible for deploying the Spartan Satellite which, however, malfunctioned, necessitating a spacewalk by Winston Scott and Tako Dol, two of her fellow astronauts, to retrieve the satellite.\n\nBorn on 17 March 1962 in Karnal, India\n→\n\n2.\n→\n\n3.\n→\n\n4.\n→\n\n5.\n→\n\n6.",

          "explanation": "The speaker of the poem captures his cold and distant memories with his dutiful father in flashback. Even on holidays, the father would rise. early to make fires to keep the house warm in biting cold. Moreover, the selfless father, sacrificing his own comforts, would polish the son's unstained shoes and take care of the family's happiness. However, the little son could hardly appreciate fatherly love, and so the adult son now regrets disrespecting his father."

In fact, he was one of the greatest leaders of the world who struggled against apartheid throughout his life. The blacks were treated cruelly. They were denied all basic human rights. They were aliens in their own country and were subjected to all sorts of indignities. Even dogs received a much better treatment than the blacks. The great leader vowed to put an end to the inhuman practice. He was thrown behind the prison bar. But the oppressive rulers could not break the spirit. Eventually, the great leader realized the goal of liberating his own people."

High up on its branches was the nest of a crow. The crow had four young chicks in its nest. Whenever the crow would leave the nest to bring food for its chicks, the snake would climb and eat one. In this way, the snake ate up three of the chicks. The crow at last thought of a plan to get rid of its enemy. It stole an expensive necklace of the princess from the Royal Palace and dropped it into the snake's hole after scattering a few rubies here and there.

          "explanation": "The pie chart provides information about the percentages of types of transportation used by 800 students to come to college. From the graph, we cansee that the highest number of students come to college on bicycle which is about 45%. Then, the second position is claimed by the bus. Around 30% of the total students come to college by bus. On the other hand, the students who live near the college campus usually come to college on foot and their number is around 15%. Students of some rich families come to college by car. Their number is 10% of the total students. Hence, from the information of the graph, we can say that the communication system of the college is quite good. Again, we can say that most of the students reside near the college and so, they can come to college by bicycle, by bus, or on foot."

By chance it ran over the face of the lion. It awoke the lion. At this the lion grew very angry with the silly mouse. The mouse became very much frightened. But he did not lose heart. He said to the lion, \"O king of the jungle, I am a very tiny creature. I made a great mistake, please forgive me this time. I may be of some help to you any time in future. Even the smallest creatures can be of great help to the giants.\" Hearing this the lion smiled and let the mouse go. Days, months and years passed by. One night the mouse heard the roar of a lion. The mouse went to the place from where the sound was coming. Having reached there, it saw the lion trapped in a hunter's net. The net was too strong for the lion to tear. The mouse gave its identity and requested him not to make any sound. Then the mouse began to cut the rope with its sharp teeth. The lion was freed before dawn (ভোর). The lion expressed his gratitude (কৃতজ্ঞতা) to the mouse."
