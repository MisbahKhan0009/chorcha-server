          "explanation": "The given pie chart shows the percentage of a family's monthly income distributed into different categories. We see that 35% of the total income of the family is spent on food while 5% on clothes. Educational expenses in the family consume 20% of the total income. 4% is spent on utility bills. Transport expenses consume 4% of the total income of the family. 31% is spent on house rents. 1% income of the family goes down to savings. Analysing the pie chart, we can say that the family spends the highest amount of money on food. Its second highest amount of total income is spent on house rent. The family also saves a little money."

          "explanation": "The Honesty of a Student\nOne day, a boy named Shafi of class twelve was going to college. Suddenly, he saw a money purse dropped by someone on the road. He was quite at a loss to see the purse and decided to pick it up. He was not at all greedy and so was not in the least interested in grabbing the contents in the purse. He intended to open the purse to see if there was any visiting card. Fortunately, he found some visiting cards and ID card of the owner. Then the boy became somewhat pacified thinking that he might eventually return the purse to its real owner. However, the boy carried the bag to his parents. His parents were very pious and honest who were bringing up their son with proper moral and religious education. His father Mr. Sumon found the owner's address and mobile number on the visiting card. He called the number. The man who received phone sounded very anxious. Mr. Sumon asked him about his identity. Mr. Sumon noticed that the identity of the man corresponded with the visiting card and ID card. And the man's name was Mr. Rashid. Mr. Sumon asked Mr. Rashid if he had lost anything. Mr. Rashid anxiously replied that he had lost a purse containing a great amount of money and some documentary papers. Mr. Rashid's information completely corresponded (সংগতিপূর্ণ হওয়া) with the contents of the purse. M r \\mathrm{Mr} Mr . Sumon was certain that he (Mr. Rashid) was the real owner of the purse. He (Mr. Sumon) told him (Mr. Rashid) not to worry about the purse, adding that he (Mr. Rashid) would get back everything. Then Mr. Sumon told him to come to his (Mr. Sumon) address to receive his purse. Mr. Rashid and his wife at once started for Mr. Sumon's house. Mr. Sumon handed over the purse to Mr. Rashid. Mr. Rashid was overwhelmed with gratefulness and hugged Mr. Sumon. Mr. Rashid appreciated the boy for his honesty. Since then the two families developed a great friendly relationship between themselves."

My joy knew no bounds to receive the sletter containing much good advice for me.\nIn your letter I have noticed a great worry about my study and my spending a lot of time on Facebook. But, father, you have nothing to be worried about. I am really very busy with my ensuing HSC Examination. In our college, a special coaching arrangement has been made and we have to participate (অংশগ্রহণ করা) in the scheduled coaching programmes dally. We solve our daily problems in the coaching classes. So, we need not have to bother (মাথা ঘামান) for our studies at our house. As for spending time on facebook, I spend maximum thirty minutes on Facebook daily. This is required in this age of technology. It does not hamper my studies at all, rather I learn many important things out of it. So, please don't worry in this respect. I am very conscious of my studies. We all are well here. Please take care of your health.\nYours affectionately,\nSamina"

Education that does not illuminate our minds or does not inspire us to work for the community is not complete at all. Education is not all about getting grades or receiving certificates- we use education to make life better. We are expected to apply the knowledge, skills and values that we learn in a classroom in our engagement with the world that lies outside. And we can do so in many different ways. Let's have a look at how education works. Learners' civic engagement is highly appreciated all over the world. Civic engagement means working to make a difference in the civic life (the public life of the citizens as constructed with private or personal life) of the community using knowledge, skills, values and motivation. Civic engagement promotes the quality of life in a community by contributing to the improvement of health and wellbeing of the people.\nCivically engaged individuals recognize themselves as members of a larger social community and are concerned about civic issues. They consider themselves responsible citizens who take action or raise their voices against injustice, discrimination and other forms of social ills.\nIn civic engagement, issues of public concern are crucial. Civic engagement includes individual or group activities to protect public interests and change the way the community values itself. For example, If you are protesting against any unjust decision of the local municipality such as raising taxes or an act that might work against people's interests, you are civically engaged and your action is considered a civic engagement. This protest can be done in different ways such as organizing rallies, collecting signatures, making human chains, writing petitions, etc. You can also help control traffic in front of a school, help children to cross the roads, work in a team to clean a park or a sea beach. You can also give some services to elderly people. These are all examples of civic engagement as what you do directly affects the community.\nWhen civic engagement is a part of an academic program, and the learners' engagement is assessed following a scale, then it is called service learning. It involves the application of knowledge and skills learned in the classroom and then making a complete plan of action 1.e. preparing a budget, starting the process of implementation, involving people and activating operational strategies.",

      "uddipok": "Read the following text and make a flow chart showing the features of dream. (One is done for you.)\nDreams have fascinated philosophers for thousands of years, but only recently have dreams been subjected to empirical research and scientific study. Chances are that you've often found yourself puzzling over the content of a dream, or perhaps you've' wondered why you dream at all. First, let's start by answering a basic question: What is a dream? A dream can include any of the images, thoughts and emotions that are experienced during sleep. Dreams. can be extraordinarily vivid or very vague; filled with joyful emotions or frightening images, focused and understandable or unclear and confusing.\nWhy do we dream? What purpose do dreams serve? While many theories have been proposed no consensus has emerged. Considering the time. we spend in a dreaming state, the fact that researchers do not yet understand the purpose of dreams may seem baffling. However, it is important to consider that science is still unraveling the exact purpose and function of sleep itself: Some researchers suggest that dreams serve no real purpose, while others believe that dreaming is essential to mental, emotional and physical well-being.\nNext, let's learn more about some of the most prominent dream theories. Consistent with the psychoanalytic perspective, Sigmund Freud's theory of dreams suggests that dreams are a representation of subconscious desires, thoughts and motivations. According to Freud, people are driven by aggressive and sexual instincts that are repressed from conscious awareness. While these thoughts are not consciously expressed, they find their way into our awareness via dreams. In his famous book The Interpretation of Dreams (1899). Freud wrote that dreams are \"..... disguised fulfilments of repressed wishes.\"\nFull of thoughts, images and emotions→\n2.→\n3.→\n4.→\n5.→\n6.",
