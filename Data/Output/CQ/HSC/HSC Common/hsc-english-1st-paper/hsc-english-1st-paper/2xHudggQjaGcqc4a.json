(One is done for you.)\nDreams have fascinated philosophers for thousands of years, but only recently have dreams been subjected to empirical research and scientific study. Chances are that you've often found yourself puzzling over the content of a dream, or perhaps you've' wondered why you dream at all. First, let's start by answering a basic question: What is a dream? A dream can include any of the images, thoughts and emotions that are experienced during sleep. Dreams. can be extraordinarily vivid or very vague; filled with joyful emotions or frightening images, focused and understandable or unclear and confusing.\nWhy do we dream? What purpose do dreams serve? While many theories have been proposed no consensus has emerged. Considering the time. we spend in a dreaming state, the fact that researchers do not yet understand the purpose of dreams may seem baffling. However, it is important to consider that science is still unraveling the exact purpose and function of sleep itself: Some researchers suggest that dreams serve no real purpose, while others believe that dreaming is essential to mental, emotional and physical well-being.\nNext, let's learn more about some of the most prominent dream theories. Consistent with the psychoanalytic perspective, Sigmund Freud's theory of dreams suggests that dreams are a representation of subconscious desires, thoughts and motivations. According to Freud, people are driven by aggressive and sexual instincts that are repressed from conscious awareness. While these thoughts are not consciously expressed, they find their way into our awareness via dreams. In his famous book The Interpretation of Dreams (1899). Freud wrote that dreams are \"..... disguised fulfilments of repressed wishes.\"\nFull of thoughts, images and emotions→\n2.→\n3.→\n4.→\n5.→\n6.",

      "uddipok": "Read the following text and make a flow chart highlighting the different aspects of sociocultural life as reflected in folk music.\nIn Bangladesh, folk music has great variety, with songs composed on culture, festivals, views of life, natural beauty, rivers and rural and riverine life. These songs are also about social inequality and poverty, about the material world and the supernatural. Mystical songs have been composed using the metaphors of rivers and boats. Since the country is basically riverine, the Bhatiyali forms an important genre of folk music. Nature plays a role in providing the content and rhythm of folk music. The folk music of Bangladesh varies from region to region, reflecting changes in the natural environment and the dialects people use. Thus there are the northern Bhawaiya, the eastern Bhatiyali and the southwestern Baul songs.\nSongs reflecting rural and riverine life→\n2→\n3→\n4→\n5→\n6",

          "question": "",
          "explanation": "\n(a)\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines adolescence as the period of life between 10 and 19 years of age. This stage marks the transition from childhood to adulthood, characterized by significant physical, emotional, and social development. Adolescents experience rapid growth and undergo various changes that influence their health, behavior, and interactions with society.\n(b)\nAccording to the 2022 Bangladesh Census, the population of adolescents aged 10–14 is approximately 16.6 million, with 8.5 million boys and 7.8 million girls. For the 15–19 age group, there are about 16.5 million adolescents, comprising 8.1 million boys and 8.5 million girls. In total, adolescents make up about 28.8% of Bangladesh's population, with a near-equal distribution between boys and girls.\n(c)\nAdolescent girls in Bangladesh face several challenges\nChild Marriage : Approximately 51% of girls in Bangladesh are married before the age of 18, making it one of the highest rates globally.\nEducation : While enrollment rates for girls have improved, many still face barriers to completing secondary education, especially in rural areas.\nHealth Risks : Early pregnancies pose significant health risks, with many adolescent girls becoming mothers before reaching adulthood.\nViolence and Abuse : A significant number of adolescent girls experience physical or sexual violence, often within intimate relationships.\nThese issues hinder their development and access to opportunities, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.\n(d)\nIn Bangladesh, the legal age for marriage is 18 for girls and 21 for boys, as stipulated by the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 2017. However, the law includes provisions that allow for exceptions under certain circumstances, such as parental consent and court approval, which have been criticized for potentially undermining efforts to prevent child marriage.\n(e)\nWhile the legal age for marriage is 21 for boys in Bangladesh, readiness for marriage is influenced by various factors beyond age, including emotional maturity, financial stability, and societal expectations. Cultural norms often dictate that men should be established in their careers and capable of supporting a family before marriage. However, these expectations can vary widely across different communities and regions within the country."

          "explanation": "The pie chart provides information about the percentages of types of transportation used by 800 students to come to college. From the graph, we cansee that the highest number of students come to college on bicycle which is about 45%. Then, the second position is claimed by the bus. Around 30% of the total students come to college by bus. On the other hand, the students who live near the college campus usually come to college on foot and their number is around 15%. Students of some rich families come to college by car. Their number is 10% of the total students. Hence, from the information of the graph, we can say that the communication system of the college is quite good. Again, we can say that most of the students reside near the college and so, they can come to college by bicycle, by bus, or on foot."

          "explanation": "Once, there lived a woodcutter. He was very poor but honest. He lived on the bank of a river near a jungle. He used to cut wood every day from the dense forest, selling it in the nearby village to make a meager living. Despite his hardships, he was content with his simple life and found joy in the beauty of nature surrounding him.\nOne day, while he was deep in the forest, he noticed something glimmering in the water. Curious, he approached the riverbank and discovered a beautiful golden axe submerged in the river. The woodcutter knew that this axe was not his, so he decided to leave it there. Suddenly, a fairy appeared before him, emerging from the water. She was impressed by his honesty and told him that she would reward him for his noble character.\nThe fairy asked the woodcutter if he wanted a new axe. He replied that he only needed a simple iron axe to continue his work. The fairy then gave him a sturdy, shining iron axe, and in return for his honesty, she granted him the ability to always find enough wood to sell and provide for his needs.\nFrom that day on, the woodcutter’s life changed for the better. He worked hard, but now he always had enough wood to sell and even started saving money. He was able to help others in his village, sharing his fortune with those less fortunate than himself.\nYears passed, and the woodcutter remained grateful for the fairy’s gift. He often visited the riverbank, where he first met her, to express his gratitude and remember the lesson of honesty and kindness. And so, the woodcutter lived happily, surrounded by the beauty of the forest and the friendship of his community."

I just had an amazing three-day reunion at our college, and I want to share some special moments with you. It was great to go back to the campus and see so many familiar faces and places.\nOn the first day, we had a big welcome ceremony in the auditorium. Everyone was excited to reunite after so many years. Our favourite English teacher gave a touching speech about our batch. Then we sat on the playground and talked about many things. The teachers inquired about our current institutions and activities. Then we laughed and shared stories at the dinner party later that night. The second day was full of fun activities. In the morning, we played two friendly sports tournaments and I joined both the football and cricket matches. It felt like going back to memory lane! In the afternoon, we had a talent show with some impressive performances, like singing, dancing, and even stand-up comedy. On the last day, we took a tour around the campus, visiting our favourite spots. We captured group and single photos. The organizers surprised us with a video clip of photos and clips from our college days, which brought back many emotions. We ended the reunion with a farewell dinner and promised to keep in touch.\nI wish you could have been there to experience it with me. It was a beautiful reminder of our friendships and the unforgettable times we spent together. I can't wait to catch up and share more stories with you in person! Please meet me soon.\nYour friend,\nRizwan\n* Draw an envelope and write full addresses of the writer and the addressee."
