          "explanation": "Girls should not be Left Behind\nUrmila was a little girl who grew up in a village named Patuair in Kishoreganj district. A small river called Phuleswari flowed through her village. At the age of five, Urmila used to go to the river with her father and started to learn swimming. Her mother did not like the idea of her daughter swimming in the river. But her father was happy to train Urmila to be a competent swimmer. Who knew that the little girl would become an accomplished swimmer one day!\nToday, Urmila is the youngest swimming champion at the national level. But the journey was not easy. Urmila had to face the backlashes of her community. Initially, the senior citizens of her village were against the idea of a girl exposing herself to public and gaining prominence. In a conservative society like Bangladesh, it is considerably difficult for a girl of Urmila's age to pursue her dream. Her first struggle was to convince her mother that it was safe for a girl to go for a swimming career. Her mother was scared that it would be difficult to\nmarry her off in the future. However, Urmila's father did not pay any heed to her mother's words as he was a liberal man who believed that a woman should create her own identity through her work, not through marriage. The only thing that hinders a woman from pursuing her dreams is the fear of criticism. So, he not only gave her training to become a skilled swimmer, but also helped her grow the mental strength to fight against all odds.\n"

          "explanation": "6 Panthapath Crossing\nDhaka\n24 February 2024\nMy dear Rifat,\nI was very delighted to receive your letter yesterday. It is good to know that you are doing well and getting good grades in your study. Everyone here is in good health as well. In your last letter, you mentioned about the dispute between the two street vendors near your school and it\nreminded me of a very important issue. Are you aware of the term civic engagement? Even if you are not, you must have noticed how we are sharing our society with a group of various kinds of people. Sometimes, there is harmony, sometimes there is disagreement, but at the end of day, all of us are a part of a team. So, it is important that we are always communicating with each other, assisting in difficult matters and working towards building a society that will be beneficial to everyone. It is in simple words that is what civic engagement is, to engage in works that brings the betterment of a community. Next time when you see two vendors arguing with each other, identify their misunderstanding and help them come up with a solution. Your smallest contribution can help maintain peace in your locality. Maybe you can participate in voluntary works, pick up trash so that your streets are cleaner. There are so many ways for you, me and others to contribute. No more today. I would like to know about the activities you participate in, so write back soon.\nWith love,\nAkash"

I, on the other hand, was the son of middle-class parents and not exceptional in any sense. And yet when I was introduced to him in front of the entry to Kala Bhaban or the Arts Building of the University of Dhaka by a mutual friend, he greeted me with the friendliest of smiles and a warm handshake. He made me feel instantly that I would be his friend!He was hugely popular in his own right by then. I already knew a lot about him from my Dhanmondi friends. For example, I knew that he was quite good at basketball and cricket, actively interested in music, always lively and full of good spirits. These qualities never deserted him. He was also known to be a tireless organizer - in student politics, of course, but also in the sports and cultural arenas. Although we never met regularly after 1971, he continued to be warm and friendly, whenever we met, inside or outside the university.",
