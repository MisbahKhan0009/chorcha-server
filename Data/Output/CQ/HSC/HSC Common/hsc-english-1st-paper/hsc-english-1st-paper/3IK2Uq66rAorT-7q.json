Kuakata in Latachapli union under Kalapara Police Station of Patuakhali district is about 30 km in length and 6 km in breadth. It is 70 km from Patuakhali district headquarters and 320 km from Dhaka. An excellent combination of the picturesque natural beauty, sandy beaches, blue sky and the shimmering expanse of water of the Bay of Bengal and the evergreen forest makes Kuakata a much sought after tourist destination. The name Kuakata takes its origin from the story of a 'Kua'-or well -dug on the sea shore by the early Rakhaine settlers for collecting drinking water. The Rakhaines had landed on Kuakata coast after being expelled from Arakan by the Mughals. Following the first well, it became a tradition to dig wells in the neighborhood of Rakhaine homesteads for fresh water supply.\nKuakata is one of the unique spots which allow a visitor to watch both the sunrise and the sunset from the beach. That perhaps makes Kuakata one of the world's most attractive beaches. The long and wide beach at Kuakata has a typical natural setting. This sandy beach slopes gently into the Bay and bathing there is as pleasant as is swimming or diving",

(One is done for you):\nAccording to some myths and legends, Gazi Pir was a Muslim saint who is said to have spread Islam in the parts of Bengal close to the Sundarbans. He was credited with many miracles. For example, he could supposedly calm dangerous animals and make them docile. He is usually depicted in paats or scroll paintings riding a fierce-looking Bengal tiger, a snake in his hand, but in no apparent danger. According to some stories, he also fought crocodiles who threatened the people of a region full of canals and creeks, indeed, a kind of watery jungle bordering the Bay of Bengal. Because of his alert and vigilant presence, all predatory animals were said to have been kept within bounds. It was also believed that he enabled villagers to live close to forests and jungles and cultivate their lands.\n1. Close to the Sundarbans → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6.",

But in the whole length and breadth of India there is not a single university established in the modern time where a foreign or an Indian student can properly be acquainted with the best products of the Indian mind. For that we have to cross the sea, and knock at the doors of France and Germany.

Instead , we are now having a night-marish experience of lawlessness, violence and misrule. The lords of the mischief mongers are getting upper hand in the society, whereas the meek and mild become the worst sufferers. Disorder  in everything has become the order of the day. Every year the Government, different organization and institutions take elaborate programmes to celebrate the day on a befitting manner. The national flag is hosted in all important offices, buildings, institutions and shops. All important places are tastefully decorated. Meetings and seminars are held to explain the importance of the day. On this day we pay rich tributes  to the memory of the day.

          "explanation": "The Honesty of a Student\nOne day, a boy named Shafi of class twelve was going to college. Suddenly, he saw a money purse dropped by someone on the road. He was quite at a loss to see the purse and decided to pick it up. He was not at all greedy and so was not in the least interested in grabbing the contents in the purse. He intended to open the purse to see if there was any visiting card. Fortunately, he found some visiting cards and ID card of the owner. Then the boy became somewhat pacified thinking that he might eventually return the purse to its real owner. However, the boy carried the bag to his parents. His parents were very pious and honest who were bringing up their son with proper moral and religious education. His father Mr. Sumon found the owner's address and mobile number on the visiting card. He called the number. The man who received phone sounded very anxious. Mr. Sumon asked him about his identity. Mr. Sumon noticed that the identity of the man corresponded with the visiting card and ID card. And the man's name was Mr. Rashid. Mr. Sumon asked Mr. Rashid if he had lost anything. Mr. Rashid anxiously replied that he had lost a purse containing a great amount of money and some documentary papers. Mr. Rashid's information completely corresponded (সংগতিপূর্ণ হওয়া) with the contents of the purse. M r \\mathrm{Mr} Mr . Sumon was certain that he (Mr. Rashid) was the real owner of the purse. He (Mr. Sumon) told him (Mr. Rashid) not to worry about the purse, adding that he (Mr. Rashid) would get back everything. Then Mr. Sumon told him to come to his (Mr. Sumon) address to receive his purse. Mr. Rashid and his wife at once started for Mr. Sumon's house. Mr. Sumon handed over the purse to Mr. Rashid. Mr. Rashid was overwhelmed with gratefulness and hugged Mr. Sumon. Mr. Rashid appreciated the boy for his honesty. Since then the two families developed a great friendly relationship between themselves."

The graph shows that in 2014, there were around 40 million users, which increased to approximately 60 million by 2015. Then, the number of users suddenly decreased and reached 50 million in 2016. Only this particular year marks a decrease in the number of users. Then, a significant surge occurred in 2017 and the number of internet users jumped to 70 million. This marks an increase highlighting a rapid growth in internet accessibility and usage. The number of users remained same in 2018. Finally, in 2019, the number of internet users took another jump and turned into 80 million in total. Analysing the graph, we find that within five years, the number of internet users in Bangladesh increased significantly, making it double. It is a clear indication that during this period, the country's digital infrastructure improved significantly. It also shows that people of Bangladesh are. getting accustomed to the modern technologies."
