(No. 1 has been done for you.)\nThe history of Bengal is the history of a people who have repeatedly made their highways red with their blood. We shed blood in 1952; even though we were the victors in the elections of 1954, we could not form a government then. In 1958, Ayub Khan declared Martial Law to enslave us for the next ten years. In 1966 when we launched the Six Point movement our boys were shot dead on 7 June. When after the movement of 1969 Ayub Khan fell from power and Yahya Khan assumed the reins of the government he declared that he would give us a constitution and restore democracy; we listened to him then. A lot has happened since and elections have taken place.\nI've met President Yahya Khan. I've made a request to him not only on behalf of Bengal but also as the leader of the party which has the majority in Pakistan; I said to him: \"You must hold the session of the National Assembly on 15 February.\" But he did not listen to me. He listened to Mr. Bhutto instead. At first, he said that the meeting would take place in the first week of March. We said, \"Fine, we will be taking our seats in the Assembly then.\" I said we would carry out our discussions in the Assembly.\n1.Bloodshed in 1952→\n2.→\n3.→\n4.→\n5.→\n6.",

You must also have been taught to be polite in company and keep quiet while others, especially your elders, spoke. Possibly, you at times grudged such schooling. Possibly, at times you even protested such disciplining. Now, certainly you know that you can't always behave the way you want specially in the presence of others. There are rules of behavior you have to follow in a company. We are social beings and have to consider the effect of our behavior on others, even if we are at home and dealing with our family members.\nWe have two terms to describe our social behavior- 'etiquette' and 'manners'. 'Etiquette' is a French word and it means the rules of correct behavior in society. The word 'manners' means the behavior that is considered to be polite in a particular society or culture.\nManners can be good or bad. For example, it is a bad manner to speak with food in one's mouth. No one likes a bad mannered person. Remember that etiquette and manners vary from culture to culture and from society to society.",

          "explanation": "Summary:\nYou must have been taught as a young child to greet your elders and house guests in accordance with your culture and custom. Additionally, you must have been taught to be polite in public and to be silent when others, particularly your elders, spoke. Maybe you sometimes regretted your education. Maybe you even resisted such discipline at times. You are aware that you cannot always act in the way you like, especially when other people are present.\nEtiquette and manners are two words we use to describe how we behave in social situations. You can have good or awful manners. Speaking while chewing food, for instance, is impolite. A rude individual is not popular. Keep in mind that manners and etiquette differ from culture to culture and from society to society.\nEtiquette and manners are lessons we pick up from our parents, families, and other institutions like schools, colleges, or professional organisations."

We learn etiquette and manners from our parents, families and various institutions, such as schools, colleges or professional bodies. There are rules of behaviour for all kinds of social occasions and it is important to learn them and practise them in everyday life. The manners that are correct in a wedding reception will not do in a debating club. Therefore, we have to be careful about etiquette and manners. We know how important it is to say 'please' and 'thank you' in everyday life. A few more polite expressions such as pardon me', 'excuse me', 'may I', are bound to make your day smooth and pleasant.\nRead the text above and write the synonym or antonym of the words as directed\n(a) correct (antonym) (b) polite (synonym) (c) particular (synonym) (d) remember (antonym) (e) vary (antonym) (f) institution (synonym) (g) profession (synonym) (h) careful (antonym) (i) bound (synonym) (j) smooth (antonym)",

          "explanation": "In the society I dream of, compassion reigns supreme, weaving through the fabric of every interaction and decision. It's a place where empathy fosters understanding, where differences are celebrated rather than feared. Education isn't just about facts and figures but also about nurturing curiosity and critical thinking, empowering individuals to navigate a complex world with confidence and compassion. Equality isn't just a lofty ideal; it's a lived reality, where everyone has equitable access to opportunities and resources regardless of their background or identity. Sustainability is a guiding principle, with communities living in harmony with nature, mindful of their impact on the planet and future generations. Innovation is driven not solely by profit but by the desire to improve lives and address pressing global challenges. In this society, kindness is currency, cooperation is prized over competition, and every individual's dignity is respected. It's a place where the collective well-being is prioritized, where success is measured not by individual achievement but by the thriving of the entire community. This is the society I dream of—a beacon of hope, compassion, and progress for generations to come."
