          "question": "",
          "explanation": "\n(a)\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines adolescence as the period of life between 10 and 19 years of age. This stage marks the transition from childhood to adulthood, characterized by significant physical, emotional, and social development. Adolescents experience rapid growth and undergo various changes that influence their health, behavior, and interactions with society.\n(b)\nAccording to the 2022 Bangladesh Census, the population of adolescents aged 10–14 is approximately 16.6 million, with 8.5 million boys and 7.8 million girls. For the 15–19 age group, there are about 16.5 million adolescents, comprising 8.1 million boys and 8.5 million girls. In total, adolescents make up about 28.8% of Bangladesh's population, with a near-equal distribution between boys and girls.\n(c)\nAdolescent girls in Bangladesh face several challenges\nChild Marriage : Approximately 51% of girls in Bangladesh are married before the age of 18, making it one of the highest rates globally.\nEducation : While enrollment rates for girls have improved, many still face barriers to completing secondary education, especially in rural areas.\nHealth Risks : Early pregnancies pose significant health risks, with many adolescent girls becoming mothers before reaching adulthood.\nViolence and Abuse : A significant number of adolescent girls experience physical or sexual violence, often within intimate relationships.\nThese issues hinder their development and access to opportunities, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.\n(d)\nIn Bangladesh, the legal age for marriage is 18 for girls and 21 for boys, as stipulated by the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 2017. However, the law includes provisions that allow for exceptions under certain circumstances, such as parental consent and court approval, which have been criticized for potentially undermining efforts to prevent child marriage.\n(e)\nWhile the legal age for marriage is 21 for boys in Bangladesh, readiness for marriage is influenced by various factors beyond age, including emotional maturity, financial stability, and societal expectations. Cultural norms often dictate that men should be established in their careers and capable of supporting a family before marriage. However, these expectations can vary widely across different communities and regions within the country."

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following text.\nThe term 'diaspora' is used to refer to people who have left their homelands and settled in other parts of the world, either because they were forced to do so or because they wanted to leave on their own. The word is increasingly used for such people as a collective group or a community. The world has seen many diasporas but scholars have been studying the phenomenon with great interest only in recent decades. Among the great diasporas of history is that of the Jewish people, who were forced to leave their lands in ancient times. The movement of Aryans from Central Europe to the Indian sub-continent thousands of years ago is also noteworthy diaspora, although the causes of this diaspora is unclear. In twentieth century history, the Palestinian diaspora has attracted a lot of attention and been a cause of concern for world leaders because of the plight of Palestinians. There have been massive diasporas in Africa, too, over the centuries, either because of war or because of the ravages of nature. But the chief reason why the phenomenon of diaspora is attracting so much attention now is globalization",

          "explanation": "Diaspora represents the people who have left their homelands and settled in other parts of the world. The diasporas take shelter in foreign countries leaving their ancestral land, either because they are forced to leave their country or they leave willingly. Among the great diasporas of history, the Jewish Diaspora is highly remarkable. Again, the Aryans left their homeland, Central Europe, thousands of years ago, and settled in the Indian sub-continent. In twentieth century, the Palestinian Diaspora has drawn the attention of the world leaders because of the plight and miseries of the Palestinians. However, globalization has contributed much to the recent attention to diasporas."

You must also have been taught to be polite in company and keep quiet while others, especially your elders, spoke. Possibly, you at times grudged such schooling. Possibly, at times you even protested such disciplining. Now, certainly you know that you can't always behave the way you want specially in the presence of others. There are rules of behavior you have to follow in a company. We are social beings and have to consider the effect of our behavior on others, even if we are at home and dealing with our family members.\nWe have two terms to describe our social behavior- 'etiquette' and 'manners'. 'Etiquette' is a French word and it means the rules of correct behavior in society. The word 'manners' means the behavior that is considered to be polite in a particular society or culture.\nManners can be good or bad. For example, it is a bad manner to speak with food in one's mouth. No one likes a bad mannered person. Remember that etiquette and manners vary from culture to culture and from society to society.",

          "explanation": "Summary:\nYou must have been taught as a young child to greet your elders and house guests in accordance with your culture and custom. Additionally, you must have been taught to be polite in public and to be silent when others, particularly your elders, spoke. Maybe you sometimes regretted your education. Maybe you even resisted such discipline at times. You are aware that you cannot always act in the way you like, especially when other people are present.\nEtiquette and manners are two words we use to describe how we behave in social situations. You can have good or awful manners. Speaking while chewing food, for instance, is impolite. A rude individual is not popular. Keep in mind that manners and etiquette differ from culture to culture and from society to society.\nEtiquette and manners are lessons we pick up from our parents, families, and other institutions like schools, colleges, or professional organisations."

          "explanation": "Folk music encompasses the traditional songs and melodies passed down orally through generations within a specific community or culture. It often reflects the experiences, beliefs, and values of a particular group of people, serving as a cultural expression and a means of storytelling. The components of folk music vary widely but typically include simple melodies, repetitive rhythms, and lyrics in the native language, sometimes accompanied by traditional instruments such as the guitar, banjo, or flute. Despite its simplicity, folk music carries a profound authenticity and emotional depth, resonating with listeners on a visceral level. In Bangladesh, folk music thrives with contributions from revered figures like Lalon Shah, Hason Raja, and Abbas Uddin. Their compositions delve into themes of love, spirituality, and the struggles of everyday life, resonating deeply with the Bangladeshi people. Folk music plays a crucial role in the social and cultural fabric of Bangladesh, serving as a means of preserving cultural heritage, fostering community cohesion, and providing a platform for collective expression. It is often performed during festivals, weddings, and other communal gatherings, fostering a sense of unity and identity among the people."

Now if I can make the crow open the beak some someshow , the price will drop down and it will be mine . in an attempt to materialise his plan he thought of several devices and finally he got on which seemed very suitable . He decided to take to flattery . So he walked up to the foot of the tree , looked  up and cried, “Good day Mistress crow. How well you are looking today . how glossy your feathers ; how bright your eyes . I feel sure that your voice must surpass in sweetness that of other birds, just as your figure does; let me hear but one song from you that I may greet you as the Queen of birds.”\n\n\nEach and every word that the fox uttered entered into the ears of the crow as the sweetest things of the worlds she had ever heard . She lifted up her head and began to crow her best. But the moments she opened her mouth the piece of meat fell to the ground only to be snapped by  the fox. “ That will do. That was all I wanted . In exchange for your meat  I will give you a piece of advice.”  No, that is not possible , “ said the fox , But I must give you the advice for the future : Do Not Trust Flatterers.” So saying the fox left the unhappy crow  brooding over her foolishness.\n"

          "explanation": "The bar graph illustrates the steady increase in the number of internet users in Bangladesh from 2014 to 2019. The graph shows that in 2014, there were around 40 million users, which increased to approximately 60 million by 2015. Then, the number of users suddenly decreased and reached 50 million in 2016. Only this particular year marks a decrease in the number of users. Then, a significant surge occurred in 2017 and the number of internet users jumped to 70 million. This marks an increase highlighting a rapid growth in internet accessibility and usage. The number of users remained same in 2018. Finally, in 2019, the number of internet users took another jump and turned into 80 million in total. Analysing the graph, we find that within five years, the number of internet users in Bangladesh increased significantly, making it double. It is a clear indication that during this period, the country's digital infrastructure improved significantly. It also shows that people of Bangladesh are. getting accustomed to the modern technologies."
