She told me to go away Now she is married to another man. My father lives very far away. I want to go to him, but he won't take me either. I begged him to send me some money so that I could buy a bus ticket. I am still waiting. He has not answered: The streets are now my home. Sometimes I find work. I used to collect trash and sell it to a vendor. I stopped doing that after I had a serious infection and a doctor told me to stay away from the trash dump. Once I worked for an ice-cream shop owner and sold ice-cream on the beach. But I got no money in return. The owner of the shop gave me something to eat, and let me sleep in his hut at night. The work was difficult and painful. The ice-cream box is quite heavy when it is full. I had to walk for hours, offering my ice-cream to whoever wanted to buy.. There were days when I could not even sell one ice-cream. In a way, I am lucky because I am alive. My friends who work sorting rubbish in dumps often suffer from serious diseases. One of them was recently killed after he fell into a hole that opened up in the pile of trash. Many of us work for 10 to 12 hours, and get so little in return that we can't even buy food.",

          "explanation": "The passage follows the story of Amerigo, a 13-year-old boy who lives alone on the streets after being rejected by both his mother and father. His mother sent him away, and his father, who lives far away, has not responded to his pleas for help. Amerigo survives by finding occasional work, such as collecting and selling trash, despite the health risks involved. He once worked for an ice-cream shop but received no money, only food and a place to sleep. Despite the hardships, Amerigo considers himself fortunate to be alive, unlike some of his friends who have suffered serious illnesses or even death from their work in trash dumps. Many like him work long hours for minimal pay, struggling to afford basic necessities like food."

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following text.\nMany adolescents face pressure to use alcohol, cigarettes, or other drugs and to initiate sexual relationships putting\nthemselves at high risk for intentional and unintentłonal injuries, unintended pregnancies, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Many also experience a wide range of adjustment and mental health problems. Behaviour patterns that are established during this period such as the use or avoidance of drugs and taking or abstaining from sexual risk can have long-lasting negative and positive effects on future health and well-being. As a result, adults have unique opportunities to influence adolescents. Adolescents are different both from young children and adults. Specifically, adolescents are not fully capable of understanding complex concepts, or the relationship between behaviour and consequences, or the degree of control they have or can have over health decision-making, including that related to sexual behaviour. This inability may make them particularly vulnerable to sexual exploitation and high-risk behaviours. Laws, customs, and practices may also affect adolescents differently than adults. For example, laws and policies often restrict adolescents' access to reproductive health information and services, especially when they are unmarried. In addition, even when services do exist, provider attitudes about adolescents often pose a significant barrier to the use of those services.",

          "explanation": "This passage highlights on the critical moments of adolescents, and the complexity and pressures they face during adolescence period. This phase is so critical since he/she has to face difficulties to adjust with them. They face life-destructing pressures and a wide range of mental and health problems. Also, this period is the shaper of his/her future with negative or positive effects. Adolescents are unable to perceive the complex concepts of life. Therefore, they become very vulnerable to high-risk behaviours and sexual exploitation. There are some restrictions and laws imposed on them to control or prevent them from going astray. As this phase is so critical for them, adults and other concerned authorities should be aware to guide them in the right direction."

      "uddipok": "Write a summary of the following passage.\nEducation aims to bring about positive changes in our behavior. It helps us try to change our lives as well as the society we live in. Education that does not illuminate our minds or does not inspire us to work for the community is not complete at all. Education is not all about getting grades or receiving certificates- we use education to make life better. We are expected to apply the knowledge, skills and values that we learn in a classroom in our engagement with the world that lies outside. And we can do so in many different ways. Let's have a look at how education works. Learners' civic engagement is highly appreciated all over the world. Civic engagement means working to make a difference in the civic life (the public life of the citizens as constructed with private or personal life) of the community using knowledge, skills, values and motivation. Civic engagement promotes the quality of life in a community by contributing to the improvement of health and wellbeing of the people.\nCivically engaged individuals recognize themselves as members of a larger social community and are concerned about civic issues. They consider themselves responsible citizens who take action or raise their voices against injustice, discrimination and other forms of social ills.\nIn civic engagement, issues of public concern are crucial. Civic engagement includes individual or group activities to protect public interests and change the way the community values itself. For example, If you are protesting against any unjust decision of the local municipality such as raising taxes or an act that might work against people's interests, you are civically engaged and your action is considered a civic engagement. This protest can be done in different ways such as organizing rallies, collecting signatures, making human chains, writing petitions, etc. You can also help control traffic in front of a school, help children to cross the roads, work in a team to clean a park or a sea beach. You can also give some services to elderly people. These are all examples of civic engagement as what you do directly affects the community.\nWhen civic engagement is a part of an academic program, and the learners' engagement is assessed following a scale, then it is called service learning. It involves the application of knowledge and skills learned in the classroom and then making a complete plan of action 1.e. preparing a budget, starting the process of implementation, involving people and activating operational strategies.",

The main objective of education is to make life better. Civic engagement of the learners is highly appreciated all over the world nowadays. A civically engaged person works to create a difference in the civic life taking action or raising voice against injustice, discrimination and other forms of social ills. When we work for social welfare, we are civically engaged. Civic engagement may be individual or group activities. For example, we can raise voice against raising excessive taxes. This protest can be done by organising ralles, collecting signature, making human chains, etc. Learners engagement is evaluated by following a scale. Rnowledge and skills learned in the school is applied. in society for public welfare."

          "explanation": "The bar graph illustrates the positive and negative uses of the internet by different age groups. It divides users into four categories: children (3-12 years old), teenagers (13-19 years old), young adults (20-35 years old), and adults (36-60 years old).\nOverall, the graph suggests that positive use outweighs negative use for all age groups. However, there is a clear downward trend in positive use as age increases.\nChildren have the highest percentage of positive internet use, at 80%. The negative use is also the highest for this age group, at 55%.\nTeenagers show a similar positive use rate at 80%, with a decrease in negative use to 50%.\nYoung adults see a slight dip in positive use at 70%, while negative use falls significantly to 20%.\nAdults have the lowest positive use at 60%, and the lowest negative use at 30%.\nThe graph indicates a potential correlation between age and internet safety. While younger age groups engage in more positive online activities, they are also exposed to a higher percentage of negative experiences. As users mature, they tend to gravitate more towards positive online activities."

One day, the crow found some beautiful feathers of a peacock in a jungle. He became very glad. He took the feathers one by one and struck them in among his own feather. He looked at himself and became glad and proud because he was no longer ugly like other crows. So, he made up his mind to go to the peacock and live with them. Seeing him, the peacocks understood that he was the crow in the guise of a peacock. They attacked him, pulled out the false feathers and drove him away. Being insulted, he returned to the crows. When he returned to the crows, they also drove him away. The crow realized his fault. He promised to the crows that he would never be false or overambitious."

It brings some relief from the heat, but it can also make it a bit gloomy to stay cooped up inside. That's when I really appreciate having a good newspaper to keep me informed and entertained.\nSpeaking of newspapers, I know you're not a big reader of them. But I wanted to write to you about all the benefits I've found from making it a daily habit. It's not just about the news anymore, although that's important too. Here are a few things I've noticed:\nStaying Informed: The world is a busy place, and newspapers help me stay updated on current events, both local and international. It gives me a broader perspective on what's happening and helps me understand the world around me better.\nImproving Vocabulary: Newspapers are full of rich vocabulary and interesting writing styles. Reading them regularly exposes me to new words and helps me improve my own communication skills.\nStaying Sharp: Reading itself is a great mental exercise, and newspapers offer a variety of content that keeps my mind active. From analyzing news articles to solving puzzles, it's a workout for the brain.\nLearning New Things: Newspapers cover a wide range of topics, from science and technology to history and culture. Every day, I learn something new and interesting that I might not have otherwise encountered.\nI know you might be busy, but even starting with just 15-20 minutes a day can make a difference. Maybe you could focus on sections that interest you most, like sports or technology. There are even digital versions of some newspapers available now, which might be more convenient for you.\nGive it a try, Nayon! You might be surprised at how much you enjoy it and how much you learn.\nWrite back and let me know what you think.\nBest,\nShimul"
