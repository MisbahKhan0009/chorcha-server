      "uddipok": "Summarize the following text.\nValentina Tereshkova was born in a village, in Central Russia on 6 March 1937. Her father was a tractor driver and her mother worked in a textile plant. At the age of eight she began her schooling but did not enjoy it much. She left the school within a few years. Afterwards she completed her education through distance learning. She became interested in parachuting from a young age, and trained in skydiving at the local Aeroclub, making her first jump at age 22 on 21 May 1959. It was her expertise in skydiving that led to her selection as a cosmonaut.After the flight of Yuri Gagarin, the first human being to travel to outer space in April 1961, the Soviet Union decided to send a woman in space. On 16 February 1962, \"proletaria\" Valentina Tereshkova was selected for this project from among more than four hundred applicants. Tereshkova had to undergo a series of training that included weightless flights, isolation tests, centrifuge tests, rocket theory, spacecraft engineering, 120 parachute jumps and pilot training in MiG-15UTI jet fighters. Since the successful launch of the spacecraft Vostok-5 on 14 June 1963, Tereshkova began preparing for her own flight. On the morning of 16 June 1963, Tereshkova and her. back-up cosmonaut Solovyova were dressed in space-suits and taken to the space shuttle launch pad by a bus. After completing her communication and life support checks, she was sealed inside Vostok-6. Finishing a two-\nhour countdown, Vostok-6 launched faultlessly. Although Tereshkova experienced nausea and physical discomfort for much of the flight, she orbited the earth 48 times and spent almost three days in space. With a single flight, she logged more flight time than the combined times of all American astronauts who had flown before that date. Tereshkova also maintained a flight log and took photographs of the horizon, which were later used to identify aerosol layers within the atmosphere. Vostok-6 was the final Vostok flight and was launched two days after Vostok-5, which carried Valary Bykovsky into a similar orbit for five days, landing three hours after Tereshkova. The two vessels approached each other within 5 kilometers at one point, and from space Tereshkova communicated with Bykovsky and the Soviet leader Khrushchev by radio.",

          "explanation": "Valentina Tereshkova, born in 1937, grew up in Central Russia. She left school early but continued education through distance learning. Passionate about parachuting, she trained extensively and made her first jump at 22. Selected as a cosmonaut in 1962, she underwent rigorous training. On June 16, 1963, she boarded Vostok-6, becoming the first woman in space. Despite feeling discomfort, she orbited Earth 48 times in nearly three days, contributing valuable data. Her flight time surpassed combined American astronaut times. Tereshkova's achievements marked a significant milestone in space exploration."

          "explanation": "Urmi was an HSC examinee. After completing her HSC exam, she went to Dhaka to take admission test in Dhaka University, But she did not get chance in the university. Being frustrated, she returned home, the weight of disappointment heavy on her shoulders. Tears welled up in her eyes as familiar sights of her town greeted her - the bustling market, the rickety rickshaws honking their way through the streets, the comforting aroma of street food wafting through the air. Everything seemed the same, yet everything felt different.\nUrmi locked herself in her room, the silence amplifying the hollowness within her. Her dream of studying at the prestigious Dhaka University felt like shattered glass. Her parents, though worried, offered quiet words of comfort. Her mother, ever the optimist, reminded her, \"One closed door doesn't mean the end of the road, beta.\"\nDays turned into weeks, and the initial sting of rejection began to dull. Urmi found solace in the company of her old friends. They too were navigating their own post-exam uncertainties, and their shared experiences offered a sense of camaraderie. One afternoon, while browsing the internet with a friend, Urmi stumbled upon a brochure for a renowned private university in her city. It offered a program in literature, her true passion, alongside a vibrant campus life.\nA spark of hope ignited within her. Urmi researched the university, her heart pounding with a newfound excitement. The application process was swift, and to her immense joy, she received an acceptance letter. It wasn't Dhaka University, but it was an opportunity, a chance to pursue her dreams closer to home.\nStepping onto the bustling campus of her new university, Urmi took a deep breath. The disappointment of the past still lingered, but it was overshadowed by a sense of determination. She may not have achieved her initial goal, but she had found a new path, one that could lead her to a future filled with learning, growth, and maybe, just maybe, a career that would make her heart sing."

This information was just like a bolt from the blue to me. I did not expect it as I knew that, you had always been very careful and cautious about maintaining safe distance and wearing mask. Anyway, \"Prevention is better than cure\" does not always work. Sometimes, many unexpected (অপ্রত্যাশিত) things happen in our life and we must remain ready to face and fight them out. COVID-19 is now a pandemic (অতিমারী/বৈশ্বিক মহামারি); anybody may be infected with COVID-19 any time and anywhere. So, there is nothing to be worried. Many COVID-19 patients are being dehospitalized everyday after full recovery. Have patience and follow your doctor's advice. You are a conscious person and I am sure you will maintain your quarantine (সঙ্গনিরোধ) period properly. By the grace of the Almighty, you will come round very soon. Don't lose your mental strength. Courage and mental strength play a vital role to cure a COVID-19 patient. You know vaccination programme is going on across the world including our country. So, after getting fully recovered, don't make delay in getting vaccinated.\nWishing your earliest recovery.\nYour loving friend,\nSumon"
