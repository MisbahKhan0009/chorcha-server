(No. 1 has been done for you):-\nA craftwork is an applied form of art, a social and cultural product reflecting the inclusive nature of folk imagination. A craftwork, which usually doesn’t bear the signature of its maker, retains a personal touch. When we look at a thirty year old nakshikantha we wonder at its motifs and designs that point to the artistic ingenuity and the presence of the maker in it. The fact that we don’t know her name or any other details about her doesn’t take anything away from our appreciation of the artist. Indeed, the intimate nature of the kantha and the tactile feeling it generates animate the work and make it very inviting. A craftwork is shaped by the interaction of individual creativity and community aesthetics, utility functions and human values. It is distinguished by its maker’s desire to locate himself or herself in the wider and ever-changing cultural aspirations of the community, and subsequently of the market.\n1.

The fact is, you ruin your palate by all the meat you eat.” We waited for the asparagus to be cooked. Panic seized me. It was not a question now of how much money I should have left over for the rest of the month, but whether I had enough to pay the bill.The asparagus appeared. They were enormous, succulent and appetizing. The smell of the melted butter tickled my nostrils....... “Coffee?” I said. “Yes, just an ice-cream and coffee,” she answered. I was past caring now. So, I ordered coffee for myself and an icecream and coffee for her. “You know, there's one thing I believe in,” she said, as she ate the ice-cream. “One should always get up from a meal feeling one could eat a little more.”",

At the\nend, the guest tells the host that she thinks one should always get up from a meal feeling one could eat a little more."

He saw the crow taking a rest rest   the with the piece of meat in her beak . The fox said to himself , I cannot climb up that high secretly and snatch the piece of meat . Now if I can make the crow open the beak some someshow , the price will drop down and it will be mine . in an attempt to materialise his plan he thought of several devices and finally he got on which seemed very suitable . He decided to take to flattery . So he walked up to the foot of the tree , looked  up and cried, “Good day Mistress crow. How well you are looking today . how glossy your feathers ; how bright your eyes . I feel sure that your voice must surpass in sweetness that of other birds, just as your figure does; let me hear but one song from you that I may greet you as the Queen of birds.”\n\n\nEach and every word that the fox uttered entered into the ears of the crow as the sweetest things of the worlds she had ever heard . She lifted up her head and began to crow her best. But the moments she opened her mouth the piece of meat fell to the ground only to be snapped by  the fox. “ That will do. That was all I wanted . In exchange for your meat  I will give you a piece of advice.”  No, that is not possible , “ said the fox , But I must give you the advice for the future : Do Not Trust Flatterers.” So saying the fox left the unhappy crow  brooding over her foolishness.\n"

          "explanation": "The given graph demonstates the percentage of people who are living below the poverty line from 2005 to 2020. The chart includes a comparative study of rural area and urban one. In 2005, 35% of people were living below the poverty line in rural area whereas it was 21% in urban one. Unfortunately, the number increased for both areas in 2010, when 45% were living below the poverty line in rural area and 30% in urban area. Then in 2015 the percentage with a little fall comes down to 32 and 25 for rural and urban area respectively. Additionally, the percentage went lower in 2020, 28% of people were living below poverty line in rural area and 20% in urban area. So, we learn from the chart that the living standard of the people were the lowest in 2010 as it had the largest number of f people living below the poverty line."
