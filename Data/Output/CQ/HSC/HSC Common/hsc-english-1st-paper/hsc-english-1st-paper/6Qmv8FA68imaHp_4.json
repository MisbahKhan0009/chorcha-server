          "explanation": "\n(a)\nMeditation is a mental practice aimed at cultivating awareness, focus, and emotional balance. It involves techniques such as concentrating on the breath, repeating mantras, or observing thoughts without attachment. Meditation has been practiced across various cultures and religions for centuries, offering benefits like stress reduction and enhanced mental clarity.\nVoltaire, the French Enlightenment philosopher, is not typically associated with meditation in the traditional sense. However, his emphasis on reason and critical thinking reflects a form of mental discipline akin to meditative practices. While he may not have explicitly discussed meditation, his advocacy for introspection and rational thought aligns with the principles of mindfulness and self-awareness inherent in meditation.\n(b)\nMeditation has been integral to various religious traditions due to its role in spiritual development and self-realization. In Hinduism, the practice of Dhyana is emphasized in texts like the Bhagavad Gita, where it is described as a means to purify the mind and attain spiritual insight. Similarly, in Buddhism, Dhyāna (or Jhāna ) is central to mental training, leading to states of equanimity and awareness. These practices help individuals detach from sensory distractions and focus on inner consciousness, facilitating a deeper connection with the divine or the true self. (Wikipedia, Wikipedia)\n(c)\nIn contemporary society, meditation is practiced for various reasons:\nStress Reduction : Meditation helps lower cortisol levels, the body's primary stress hormone, promoting relaxation. (Forbes)\nEnhanced Focus and Concentration : Regular meditation improves attention span and cognitive function. (Calm)\nEmotional Regulation : It aids in managing emotions, reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression.\nImproved Sleep Quality : Meditation can alleviate insomnia and enhance overall sleep patterns. (Medical News Today)\nPhysical Health Benefits : Regular practice may lower blood pressure and alleviate chronic pain. (Medical News Today)\n(d)\nTo develop concentration through meditation:\nChoose a Quiet Environment : Select a distraction-free space to practice.\nSet a Time Limit : Start with short sessions, gradually increasing duration\nAdopt a Comfortable Posture : Sit in a relaxed yet attentive position.\nFocus on a Single Point : Concentrate on your breath, a mantra, or an object.\nRedirect Attention Gently : When your mind wanders, calmly bring focus back to your point of concentration.\nPractice Regularly : Consistency is key to strengthening concentration.\nBy incorporating these steps, you can enhance your ability to concentrate over time.\n(e)\nMeditation induces several changes in the brain and body:\nBrain Activity Changes : Meditation can alter brain waves, promoting states of calm and focus. (Stanford Magazine)\nIncreased Neuroplasticity : Regular practice enhances neural connectivity, improving cognitive functions. (Verywell Mind)\nEmotional Balance : It helps regulate emotions, leading to improved mood and reduced anxiety.\nPhysical Health Improvements : Meditation can lower blood pressure and reduce symptoms of chronic pain.

The entire Island can be walked about in 3 hours. The Island is known for its unique natural beauty with white sandy beaches fringed with coconut palms and a diverse marine life. Due to the expansion of unregulated tourism, the Island is facing increasing erosion, contamination of surface and ground water, wildlife displacement, and loss of biodiversity. Other threats include cutting of sand dune vegetation for fuel-wood and hotel establishment; degradation of sand dune habitat; the harvesting of turtle eggs; indiscriminate exploitation of coral resources etc. To address this, the Government has declared some areas of the Island as Ecologically Critical Area (ECA), prohibiting unauthorized constructions there.\n1.

So Abdul packed a suitcase with two loaves and some tea and tins of milk cheese and jam. We travelled intermediate class in a cross-country train not uncomfortably crowded, through a country of shadowy loveliness. It was a moonlit night of broken soft clouds; the land was mostly under water, with paddy and cocopalms growing from it and a few raised cart-tracks and groups of cottages islanded among clumps of bushes, all reflected among shadows. Here and there was the red glow of a cooking-fire or the lantern of a fisherman's boat in open water. At dawn we reached Sonaimuri, a small canal-side station among wide fields, from there we had eight more miles by country boat, some of it along the canal, some of it across the flooded paddy fields. I was looking forward to that tranquil water journey in the early morning, and tranquil it must have been, for I fell instantly asleep and knew no more till we reached the landing-ghat at Khorshed's father's house, in a blaze of sunlight. It turned out that his letter saying that he was bringing me was still on its way, but they rallied to the crisis and gathered round to make me welcome, though as none of them. spoke any English they could only stare and laugh and offer me coconut Juice.",

She looked around but couldn’t find anyone nearby.\nOrpi thought about keeping the money, but her conscience told her it was not right. She remembered her teacher’s words about honesty and doing the right thing. So, she decided to take the money bag to her school.\nWhen she reached school, she gave the bag to her teacher. The teacher praised Orpi for her honesty and promised to help find the owner. Later that day, the owner came to the school and was very thankful to Orpi. He gave her a small reward, but Orpi politely refused, saying honesty was its own reward.\nFrom that day, Orpi became an example of honesty in her school and community."
