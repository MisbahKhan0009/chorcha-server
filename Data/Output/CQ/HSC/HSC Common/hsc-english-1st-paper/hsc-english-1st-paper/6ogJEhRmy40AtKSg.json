      "uddipok": "Cyber bullying is basically an act done by a person(s) against another person(s) by using electronic communication, e.g. social media. A few examples of cyber bullying are causing someone harm by posting unwanted or private information, threatening a person by sending mean messages via emails, social networking websites, text or audio messages, spreading rumors via email or social networking sites, sharing private/embarrassing pictures, creating fake profiles, etc.\nIn Bangladesh, cyber bullying is not just an act to be scorned at but is an offence punishable under the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Act 2006. The Act, inter alia, provides that a person who deliberately publishes, in a website or in electronic form, any material which is fake and obscene or has the effect of corrupting persons who are likely to read, see or hear the material or causes to prejudice the image of a person or may hurt religious belief or instigate against any person, then the person publishing the material will be guilty of an offence under the Act. The punishment for such an offence is imprisonment and/or fine.\nVictims of cyber crimes (including cyber bullying) can lodge a complaint complaint to the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (BTRC) by calling at +880-29611111 or by emailing at btrc@btrc.gov.bd. BTRC is supposed to take necessary actions within 24 hours and the perpetrators will be brought to justice within 3 days after the complaint is filed. The government has also launched a cyber-crime helpline. Victims can call at +8801766678888 to submit their complaints.\nFurthermore, if the harassment amounts to criminal intimidation (threatening someone with injury to his/her person, reputation, property etc.), then the perpetrator may be liable to punishment as per the Penal Code 1860. The steps mentioned above should definitely be taken if the matter is serious. An important first step is the internal reporting process of the particular social media website or application. If we take Facebook, for example, photos and comments can be reported and the particular user can be blocked. Similar reporting systems are in place in most other popular social media websites or applications.",

I brought the ax down.careless.\" \"But no one hits accurately every time,\" I told him. \"The fault was in the wood of the handle.

I wanted to write you about something important-your diet. I've noticed you've been leaning heavily towards junk food lately. These foods are easy to get, but it can have some serious effects on your health. Junk foods often lack essential nutrients, which lead us to fatigue, weak immune system, and different kinds of deficiencies. Regular consumption of junk foods can also contribute to weight gain, obesity,. and related health issues like diabetes and heart disease. Moreover, consuming too much junk food can negatively affect your digestion and mental health.\nOn the other hand, homemade foods are packed with nutrients and can provide sustained energy throughout the day. They promote better digestion and overall well-being. I know it might be challenging to change habits, but you can start by including fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in your meals. I believe in your ability to make healthier choices, and I'm here to support you every step of the way. Please try to make your health a priority and enjoy the positive changes.\nTake care.\nYour sister,\nFatema"

          "explanation": "Conspiracy Put to an End and Peace Restored\nOnce upon a time, there was a strange man who was highly bothered to see others' happiness. His own personal interest was at any cost important to him. Neither was he a polite man, nor did he like other people to be polite to each other. In fact, he hated the courteous and polite people around him and thus he hated a few expressions like please, thank you, don't mention it etc. So, he took a mission to invent a device that would steal these polite words. As the machine worked, people lost their kindness and became rude, much to the man's satisfaction. Society turned harsh and unfeeling. However, two girls having special-needs communicated through sign language discovered the source of the change. Since the machine could not capture gestures, the girls remained polite. Realizing the difference between themselves and others, they investigated and found the man hiding on a hill with his machine. The girls managed to reverse its effects, and the machine exploded, scattering polite words back into the world. Politeness was restored, and people became kind and respectful again. The anger and arguments stopped. The importance of good manners in fostering happiness and harmony was also proved. Satisfied with their success, the girls returned to their normal lives. The man, however, was left to contemplate the consequences of his actions. He realized that his efforts to eradicate politeness had only brought misery and discord. The story highlights the significance of good manners and the impact they have on creating a positive and harmonious society. The girls' determination and kindness ultimately triumphed, showing that even small acts of politeness can have a profound effect on the world around us."
