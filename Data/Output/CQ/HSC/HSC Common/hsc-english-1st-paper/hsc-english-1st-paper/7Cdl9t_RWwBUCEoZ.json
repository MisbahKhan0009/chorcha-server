(One is done for you.)\nAt daylight I was half wakened by the sound of chopping. Again it was so even in texture that went back to sleep. When I left my bed in the cool morning, the boy had come and gone, and a stack of kindling was neat against the cabin wall. He came arter school in the afternoon and worked until time to return to the orphanage. His name was Jerry ... he had been at the orphanage since he was four. I could picture him at four. with the same grave gray-blue eyes and the same independence? No, the word that comes to me is \"integrity\". ‥ It is bedded on courage, but it is more than brave. It is honest, but it is more than honesty. The ax handle broke one day. Jerry said the woodshop at the orphanage would repair it. I brought money to pay for the job and he refused it. \"I'll pay for it,\" he said. \"I broke it. I brought the ax down.careless.\" \"But no one hits accurately every time,\" I told him. \"The fault was in the wood of the handle. I'll see the man from whom I bought it.\" It was only then that he would take the money. He was standing back of his own carelessness. He was a free-will agent and he chose to do careful work, and if he failed, he took the responsibility without subterfuge.\nChopping wood in the morning→\n2. →\n3.→\n4.→\n5.\n6.",

          "explanation": "The bar graph illustrates the steady increase in the number of internet users in Bangladesh from 2014 to 2019. The graph shows that in 2014, there were around 40 million users, which increased to approximately 60 million by 2015. Then, the number of users suddenly decreased and reached 50 million in 2016. Only this particular year marks a decrease in the number of users. Then, a significant surge occurred in 2017 and the number of internet users jumped to 70 million. This marks an increase highlighting a rapid growth in internet accessibility and usage. The number of users remained same in 2018. Finally, in 2019, the number of internet users took another jump and turned into 80 million in total. Analysing the graph, we find that within five years, the number of internet users in Bangladesh increased significantly, making it double. It is a clear indication that during this period, the country's digital infrastructure improved significantly. It also shows that people of Bangladesh are. getting accustomed to the modern technologies."

          "explanation": "\nOnce there lived a happy cobbler who passed his day working and singing from morning to night. His firm belief was that money cannot bring happiness. Happiness lies in contentment. A rich neighbor of his was a banker who one day came and said to him,” How much a year do you earn?” The cobbler replied, “I don’t know and I never think in that way as I live from hand to mouth.” The banker said, \"I am very sorry for your poverty. You should try to change your fortune.” The cobbler laughed and said, \"I am happy with what I can earn daily.” The next day the banker came again and said, “Look, my friend! I want to drive away your distress. Take these thousand pounds, keep it carefully and use it in time of need.\"\nThe cobbler became very much surprised having the large amount. He had never seen so much money at a time in his life before. At first, he could not think where he should hide the money for safety. Then, he dug a hole in his hut and buried it.\nAt night, a new thinking crossed over his mind, “someone might steal my money.” As a result, he could not sleep at all.\n\n\nNext few days, he could neither do any work nor sleep at night for the thinking of money. At last, he could realize that the money had snatched away his mental peace and happiness. So, one morning he went to the banker’s house and returned the money. From then, he could pass his days with singing and great happiness as before.\nMoral Of the Story: Money cannot bring happiness. Happiness lies in the self contentment.\n"

          "question": "",
          "explanation": "\n(a)\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines adolescence as the period of life between 10 and 19 years of age. This stage marks the transition from childhood to adulthood, characterized by significant physical, emotional, and social development. Adolescents experience rapid growth and undergo various changes that influence their health, behavior, and interactions with society.\n(b)\nAccording to the 2022 Bangladesh Census, the population of adolescents aged 10–14 is approximately 16.6 million, with 8.5 million boys and 7.8 million girls. For the 15–19 age group, there are about 16.5 million adolescents, comprising 8.1 million boys and 8.5 million girls. In total, adolescents make up about 28.8% of Bangladesh's population, with a near-equal distribution between boys and girls.\n(c)\nAdolescent girls in Bangladesh face several challenges\nChild Marriage : Approximately 51% of girls in Bangladesh are married before the age of 18, making it one of the highest rates globally.\nEducation : While enrollment rates for girls have improved, many still face barriers to completing secondary education, especially in rural areas.\nHealth Risks : Early pregnancies pose significant health risks, with many adolescent girls becoming mothers before reaching adulthood.\nViolence and Abuse : A significant number of adolescent girls experience physical or sexual violence, often within intimate relationships.\nThese issues hinder their development and access to opportunities, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.\n(d)\nIn Bangladesh, the legal age for marriage is 18 for girls and 21 for boys, as stipulated by the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 2017. However, the law includes provisions that allow for exceptions under certain circumstances, such as parental consent and court approval, which have been criticized for potentially undermining efforts to prevent child marriage.\n(e)\nWhile the legal age for marriage is 21 for boys in Bangladesh, readiness for marriage is influenced by various factors beyond age, including emotional maturity, financial stability, and societal expectations. Cultural norms often dictate that men should be established in their careers and capable of supporting a family before marriage. However, these expectations can vary widely across different communities and regions within the country."

          "explanation": "The speaker of the poem captures his cold and distant memories with his dutiful father in flashback. Even on holidays, the father would rise. early to make fires to keep the house warm in biting cold. Moreover, the selfless father, sacrificing his own comforts, would polish the son's unstained shoes and take care of the family's happiness. However, the little son could hardly appreciate fatherly love, and so the adult son now regrets disrespecting his father."
