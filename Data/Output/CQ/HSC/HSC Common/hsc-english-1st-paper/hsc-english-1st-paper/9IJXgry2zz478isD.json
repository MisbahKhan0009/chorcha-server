          "explanation": "The pie chart displays the various sources of air pollution in a city, highlighting five key contributors. Vehicles are by far the most significant source, accounting for 60% of total air pollution. This indicates a heavy reliance on private and commercial transportation, possibly due to limited public transport infrastructure. Industry is the second-largest contributor at 18% , reflecting emissions from factories and manufacturing units. Power plants contribute 13% , suggesting that electricity generation—likely from fossil fuels—is another major pollutant. Waste disposal activities are responsible for 3% , while heating or using gas contributes nothing ( 0% ), showing negligible or highly controlled emissions in that category.\nThe disparity is stark: vehicles alone contribute more than all other sources combined, underscoring the urgent need for cleaner transport alternatives and stricter vehicular emission controls. In contrast, waste disposal and gas usage have a minimal impact, suggesting these are not major areas of concern. Targeted interventions in transport and industry could significantly improve air quality."

          "explanation": "Ismail Miah is an established farmer of Dhunchi, a village nestled along the serene banks of the Padma river. Despite being born into a humble and financially struggling family, Ismail's determination and hard work have propelled him towards success in farming. From a young age, he developed a deep connection with the land, learning the intricate rhythms of nature and the art of cultivation from his parents.\nAs he grew older, Ismail's passion for farming only intensified. He devoted himself wholeheartedly to the land, tirelessly tending to his crops under the scorching sun and through the monsoon rains. With each passing season, his fields flourished, yielding bountiful harvests that not only sustained his family but also earned him a respected position in the village.\nDespite his success, Ismail remained grounded and never forgot his roots. He believed in giving back to the community that had supported him through thick and thin. Whether it was sharing his agricultural knowledge with fellow farmers or extending a helping hand to those in need, Ismail was always ready to contribute to the welfare of his village.\nHowever, as the years went by, Ismail began to notice subtle changes in the land he loved so dearly. The once predictable patterns of weather became increasingly erratic, and the river that had been a lifeline for generations began to behave unpredictably, threatening the very existence of the village.\nDetermined to confront these challenges head-on, Ismail embarked on a journey to find sustainable solutions that would safeguard not only his own livelihood but also the future of Dhunchi. Little did he know that this journey would test not only his skills as a farmer but also his resilience in the face of adversity."

Reading about it will surely brighten your day.\nLast week, I went to visit a relative in Sreemangal. There the owner of a local restaurant told me about a nearby hill. He also said that it would only take 20 minutes on foot to reach the hill from that restaurant. I was eager for an adventure, and so I headed towards the hill. It was far from the hustle and bustle of the city. Except for the chirping of the birds and the rustling of the leaves, there was no sound. A shallow river flowed nearby. The water was so clear that I could see the stones below. I climbed the hill and sat there for half an hour to enjoy the scenery. I wish I could stay longer, but I had to return. I am sure you would also love the simplicity and tranquility of that place. It has a different kind of soothinig effect.\nNo more today. I hope we can visit this place together one day.\nYour friend,\nSamiur"

      "uddipok": "Write a summary of the following text.\nThe famous Greek philosopher Aristotle said, \"Man is by nature a social animal.\" What he meant was that man, by instinct, seeks company of others and establishes relationships, much like most animals of the wild, for companionship and for physical and emotional support. Unlike the animals however, man's relationships give meaning to his existence and inspires him to do well in education, in workplace or in a profession that he pursues.\nRelationships are of different kinds. Some are familial and intimate, formed by blood and by marriage; some are social like the ones we have with friends and some are made in school where we, form close bonds with classmates and teachers. Relationships can also be fostered in workplace, which may quickly change from professional to social. There are relationships also between human beings and animals, between children and their toys that they cannot part with.\nAll these relationships keep us close to each other and provide us all kinds of support, love and affection. A person who has no family feels the pain of loneliness and isolation. There is no one to laugh or cry with him/her. When we share our joy with someone, it simply redoubles, and when we suffer a loss and someone shares our sorrow, it lessens. Relationships are thus needed for our emotional health.\nTo build relationships, we need to have trust and respect for each other, and love where this is needed. We cannot be selfish and possessive if we want to establish an effective relationship. But quite often we see people quarrelling and fighting with each other which only brings misery and loss to all.",

          "explanation": "The passage portrays the fact that human beings naturally develop different types of relationships through trust, respect and love. Relationships are formed by blood or marriage, in educational institutions or workplaces, etc. Relationships give meaning to our existence and inspire us to perform well in every stage. Moreover, relationships fill our life with love, support, and endearment. Lonely and isolated people cannot share their joy or sorrow. Through sharing, happiness increases, and sorrows decreases. Hence, relationships are essential for mental health. However, relationships with selfishness and possessiveness are detrimental to mental health and cause sufferings."

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following passage.\nWe spend money for different reasons. We buy foods, clothes or everyday essentials, pay for different services, entertain people, travel to places, help others in need or invest in business and thus spend money every day. In fact, spending is a part of our life.\nSpending may make us happy or unhappy depending on how and why we spend. When we spend money on things that we need and within our limit, it is good. When it becomes a compulsive behaviour, it makes life stressful. Unnecessary spending or spending beyond one's means has some bad effects. For one thing, it may lead to financial ruin or debt, and for another,. it may create unhappiness within families. People who overspend are never satisfied with what they have. They always rush for brands, fashion items, designer clothes, etc. Over a period of time, it becomes an addiction which may eventually create psychological problems.\nNowadays, consumer items are displayed in stores or in advertisements in ways that they create a feeling of immediate need for them. We are constantly tempted to buy, use or consume things even when we do not have a genuine need. We all need to be careful here. Salespersons often encourage customers to buy things by flattering them. 'This is a perfect match for you,' they would say. or 'You look so stunning in that dress.' Never forget, they say the same thing to most of their customers. It is better not to be persuaded by such words. They use these words to please the customers as the more a customer buys, the higher the profit is. Overspending is not only related to shopping, it applies to other activities as well such as eating out. Many people buy too many items to eat in a restaurant. They can eat only some of them and the rest are wasted: It's not a responsible attitude. We cannot simply waste food because we have money to buy it.\nYoung people in a shopping mall often look at an item on display afd think 'Oh I must buy this. I really need this.' They may not have the money needed. In their wallet. So, they use credit cards but using them is like taking a loan. If they are not careful, the loans increase which might lead them to a debt-trap.\nSometimes children insist on buying things that their parents cannot pay without stretching their budget. This may happen because the children's friends also have them. It's not fair as it becomes a burden for the parents.\nFinally, don't get trapped by the glossy advertisements on television or the Internet. You should rather ask yourself: \"Do I need this?\" The best way to control the habit of spending is not to think 'What I need', but 'Can I do without it?'",

          "explanation": "Money is spent every day for various reasons. Necessary expenses within our limit may make us happy. But unnecessary expenditure or spending money beyond our ability creates some problems and may lead to psychological problems. At present, consumer items are exhibited and advertised so attractively that we want to buy them immediately even without having a genuine need. Salespersons often flatter the customers to encourage them to buy more things. Buying more foods than requirements and their wastage means wastage of money. Children also make their parents fall in economic crisis by pressurizing them to buy unnecessary things. We should restrain this habit of overspending by asking ourselves if we can do without the thing we feel tempted to buy."
