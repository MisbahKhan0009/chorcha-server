These songs are also about social inequality and poverty, about the material world and the supernatural. Mystical songs have been composed using the metaphors of rivers and boats. Since the country is basically riverine, the Bhatiyali forms an important genre of folk music. Nature plays a role in providing the content and rhythm of folk music. The folk music of Bangladesh varies from region to region, reflecting changes in the natural environment and the dialects people use. Thus there are the northern Bhawaiya, the eastern Bhatiyali and the southwestern Baul songs.\nSongs reflecting rural and riverine life→\n2→\n3→\n4→\n5→\n6",

She told me to go away Now she is married to another man. My father lives very far away. I want to go to him, but he won't take me either. I begged him to send me some money so that I could buy a bus ticket. I am still waiting. He has not answered: The streets are now my home. Sometimes I find work. I used to collect trash and sell it to a vendor. I stopped doing that after I had a serious infection and a doctor told me to stay away from the trash dump. Once I worked for an ice-cream shop owner and sold ice-cream on the beach. But I got no money in return. The owner of the shop gave me something to eat, and let me sleep in his hut at night. The work was difficult and painful. The ice-cream box is quite heavy when it is full. I had to walk for hours, offering my ice-cream to whoever wanted to buy.. There were days when I could not even sell one ice-cream. In a way, I am lucky because I am alive. My friends who work sorting rubbish in dumps often suffer from serious diseases. One of them was recently killed after he fell into a hole that opened up in the pile of trash. Many of us work for 10 to 12 hours, and get so little in return that we can't even buy food.",

          "explanation": "The passage follows the story of Amerigo, a 13-year-old boy who lives alone on the streets after being rejected by both his mother and father. His mother sent him away, and his father, who lives far away, has not responded to his pleas for help. Amerigo survives by finding occasional work, such as collecting and selling trash, despite the health risks involved. He once worked for an ice-cream shop but received no money, only food and a place to sleep. Despite the hardships, Amerigo considers himself fortunate to be alive, unlike some of his friends who have suffered serious illnesses or even death from their work in trash dumps. Many like him work long hours for minimal pay, struggling to afford basic necessities like food."

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following text:\nBeauty is easy to appreciate but difficult to define. As we look around, we discover beauty in pleasurable objects and sights – in nature, in the laughter of children, in the kindness of strangers. But asked to define, we run into difficulties. Does beauty have an independent objective identity? Is it universal, or is it dependent on our sense perceptions? Does it lie in the eye of the beholder? We ask ourselves. A further difficulty arises when beauty manifests itself not only by its presence, but by its absence as well, as when we are repulsed by ugliness and desire beauty. But then ugliness has as much a place in our lives as beauty, or may be more ————- as when there is widespread hunger and injustice in a society. Philosophers have told us that beauty is an important part of life, but isn't ugliness a part of life too? And if art has beauty as an important ingredient, can it confine itself only to a projection of beauty? Can art ignore what is not beautiful?",

          "explanation": "Beauty is something appreciable but quite indefinable. In our surroundings, beauty can be seen in various enjoyable forms. But defining it on one's part is very difficult. Various types of questions about its existence, form and shape move around our mind. We are moved not only by its presence but also by its absence. So, ugliness occupies as much a place in our life as beauty. Though beauty is an important part of art, art cannot ignore ugliness."

          "explanation": "Innovation of the Innovative Boy\n. There was a boy who hailed from an obscure background. But he was brilliant, diligent and innovative. He belonged to a village where there was no electricity. During summer, the atmosphere of the village was hot and humid. The villagers were even suffering from the high temperature at home. They were becoming sick due to hot weather. Some of them even died of heat stroke. The boy, however, was thinking of an idea how to get rid of the heat. He came to know from a physics teacher of his school that the gas cools when it expands quickly. So, he thought of making an air cooler out of plastic bottles for his own house. So, he collected some plastic bottles and cut them into half. Then, he mounted them on a board. After that, he placed the board over a window, with the bottlenecks facing towards the inner side of the house. As a result, the change in pressure that occurred when air entered the wider part of the bottle and came out through the bottleneck cooled the air. That's how he successfully made the air cooler out of the plastic bottles. When the villagers found it effective, they requested the boy to make the cooler for them too. As the raw plastic bottles were easily available, the cooler could be made easily and it was cheap as well. In this way, the boy could reduce the sufferings of the village and also earn some money."

Leisurely activities like recreation take up 12 %, offering balance and downtime, while play accounts for a smaller 5 %, portraying more spontaneous or fun engagement. Finally, a modest 8 % is categorized under other —likely including tasks such as meals, personal care, commuting, or light chores.
