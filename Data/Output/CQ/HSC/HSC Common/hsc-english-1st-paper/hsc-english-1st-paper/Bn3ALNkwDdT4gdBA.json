      "uddipok": "Write a summary of the following passage.\nEducation aims to bring about positive changes in our behavior. It helps us try to change our lives as well as the society we live in. Education that does not illuminate our minds or does not inspire us to work for the community is not complete at all. Education is not all about getting grades or receiving certificates- we use education to make life better. We are expected to apply the knowledge, skills and values that we learn in a classroom in our engagement with the world that lies outside. And we can do so in many different ways. Let's have a look at how education works. Learners' civic engagement is highly appreciated all over the world. Civic engagement means working to make a difference in the civic life (the public life of the citizens as constructed with private or personal life) of the community using knowledge, skills, values and motivation. Civic engagement promotes the quality of life in a community by contributing to the improvement of health and wellbeing of the people.\nCivically engaged individuals recognize themselves as members of a larger social community and are concerned about civic issues. They consider themselves responsible citizens who take action or raise their voices against injustice, discrimination and other forms of social ills.\nIn civic engagement, issues of public concern are crucial. Civic engagement includes individual or group activities to protect public interests and change the way the community values itself. For example, If you are protesting against any unjust decision of the local municipality such as raising taxes or an act that might work against people's interests, you are civically engaged and your action is considered a civic engagement. This protest can be done in different ways such as organizing rallies, collecting signatures, making human chains, writing petitions, etc. You can also help control traffic in front of a school, help children to cross the roads, work in a team to clean a park or a sea beach. You can also give some services to elderly people. These are all examples of civic engagement as what you do directly affects the community.\nWhen civic engagement is a part of an academic program, and the learners' engagement is assessed following a scale, then it is called service learning. It involves the application of knowledge and skills learned in the classroom and then making a complete plan of action 1.e. preparing a budget, starting the process of implementation, involving people and activating operational strategies.",

A civically engaged person works to create a difference in the civic life taking action or raising voice against injustice, discrimination and other forms of social ills.

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following passage:\nA plate of hot French fries and a huge burger with hot cheese oozing out of it, with a carbonated drink: looks like a treat! This calorie-rich junk food does look mouthwatering but is known to be nutritionally poor. Junk food or fast food has become an increasingly popular food choice. Ideally, junk foods are defined as processed foods with negligible nutrient value and are often high in salt, sugar and fat. But we often confuse fast foods with junk foods. How are they different? Or what is junk food really? Junk foods are processed foods consisting of high calories, but that is considered only as a broad umbrella. These foods are prepared in a way that they look appealing and are enjoyable so you are chemically programmed to ask for more. According to Dr. Sunali Sharma, a Dietician & Nutritionist, \"Commercial products including salted snack foods, chewing gum, candy, sugary desserts, fried fast food, and sweetened carbonated beverages that have little or no nutritional value but are high in calories, salt, and fats may be considered junk foods. Though not all fast foods are junk foods, a great number of them are. For instance, a salad may be fast food but is definitely not junk food. Some foods like burgers, pizzas, and tacos may alternate between junk and healthy categories depending on the ingredients, calories and process of manufacturing.\" Frequent consumption of junk food increases the intake of excess fat, simple carbohydrates, and processed sugar which may lead to a higher risk of obesity and cardiovascular diseases, among other chronic health problems. The resulting obesity may begin clogging up the arteries and lay the basis of an impending heart attack. It has also been suggested that eating junk food affects the brain in the same way as consuming addictive drugs. An addiction to junk food may even result in the rejection of healthier food options like fruits, vegetables, salads etc. leading to further lack of nourishment.",

It clarifies the difference between junk food and fast food, stating that while not all fast food is junk food, many fast food items may fall into that category. The passage highlights the negative health effects of frequent junk food consumption, such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and addiction-like responses in the brain. It also mentions how a reliance on junk food can lead to a rejection of healthier food options, resulting in inadequate nourishment."

The next significant segment is study , which occupies 20 % of the day, signaling an ongoing effort to reinforce learning outside class. Leisurely activities like recreation take up 12 %, offering balance and downtime, while play accounts for a smaller 5 %, portraying more spontaneous or fun engagement. Finally, a modest 8 % is categorized under other —likely including tasks such as meals, personal care, commuting, or light chores. Overall, this distribution reflects a well-rounded daily schedule where academic responsibilities and rest dominate, yet there remains space for recreation, play, and miscellaneous activities that contribute to a holistic routine."

One day, he saw that the fencing around the garden was broken. He said to himself, “I shall repair the fencing tomorrow.” But he totally forgot it the next day.\nSome days passed by. The farmer did not repair the broken fencing. One day, he sat idle before the house. He saw some goats entering the garden through the broken fence. He called his wife to drive the goats from the garden.\nThe farmer’s wife was cooking inside the kitchen. She came out and ran into the garden to drive away the goats. A dog was waiting outside the kitchen. When the farmer’s wife went out, the dog entered the kitchen and spoiled some of the food cooked by her.\n"

          "explanation": "Feni\n04.07.2024\nDear Mijanur,\nHey! How are things going at college? I'm writing to you today because I wanted to talk about something important – reading newspapers.\nI know you might not be a big fan of sitting down with a physical paper these days, but trust me, there are a lot of benefits to be had from this \"old-fashioned\" habit.\nFirstly, newspapers keep you informed. They give you a well-rounded view of current events, both locally and internationally. It's important to stay up-to-date on what's happening in the world, not just through social media, which can be filled with rumors and biased opinions. Newspapers offer a more reliable source of information.\nSecondly, reading newspapers improves your vocabulary and communication skills. They're full of rich, descriptive language, and you'll be exposed to new words and writing styles. This can definitely help you improve your own writing and speaking abilities.\nThirdly, newspapers challenge your mind and keep it sharp. Reading articles on various topics, from politics and science to sports and entertainment, engages your brain in a different way. It's a good mental exercise and helps you stay mentally stimulated.\nFinally, newspapers can even introduce you to new interests. You might stumble upon an article about something you never knew existed, sparking a new passion or hobby.\nI know you're busy with classes and other activities, but even just skimming through the headlines or reading a few articles a day can make a big difference. Maybe there's a section you'd find particularly interesting, like sports or technology? You could even consider subscribing to a digital version of a newspaper for easier access.\nGive it a try, [Brother's Name]! I think you might be surprised at how much you learn and enjoy it.\nLet me know what you think if you decide to check it out.\nBest,\nHarun"
