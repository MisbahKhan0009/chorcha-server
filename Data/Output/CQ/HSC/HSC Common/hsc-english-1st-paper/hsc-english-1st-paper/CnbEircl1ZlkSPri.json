Kuakata in Latachapli union under Kalapara Police Station of Patuakhali district is about 30 km in length and 6 km in breadth. It is 70 km from Patuakhali district headquarters and 320 km from Dhaka. An excellent combination of the picturesque natural beauty, sandy beaches, blue sky and the shimmering expanse of water of the Bay of Bengal and the evergreen forest makes Kuakata a much sought after tourist destination. The name Kuakata takes its origin from the story of a 'Kua'-or well -dug on the sea shore by the early Rakhaine settlers for collecting drinking water. The Rakhaines had landed on Kuakata coast after being expelled from Arakan by the Mughals. Following the first well, it became a tradition to dig wells in the neighborhood of Rakhaine homesteads for fresh water supply.\nKuakata is one of the unique spots which allow a visitor to watch both the sunrise and the sunset from the beach. That perhaps makes Kuakata one of the world's most attractive beaches. The long and wide beach at Kuakata has a typical natural setting. This sandy beach slopes gently into the Bay and bathing there is as pleasant as is swimming or diving",

You must also have been taught to be polite in company and keep quiet while others, especially your elders, spoke. Possibly, you at times grudged such schooling. Possibly, at times you even protested such disciplining. Now, certainly you know that you can't always behave the way you want specially in the presence of others. There are rules of behavior you have to follow in a company. We are social beings and have to consider the effect of our behavior on others, even if we are at home and dealing with our family members.\nWe have two terms to describe our social behavior- 'etiquette' and 'manners'. 'Etiquette' is a French word and it means the rules of correct behavior in society. The word 'manners' means the behavior that is considered to be polite in a particular society or culture.\nManners can be good or bad. For example, it is a bad manner to speak with food in one's mouth. No one likes a bad mannered person. Remember that etiquette and manners vary from culture to culture and from society to society.",

          "explanation": "Summary:\nYou must have been taught as a young child to greet your elders and house guests in accordance with your culture and custom. Additionally, you must have been taught to be polite in public and to be silent when others, particularly your elders, spoke. Maybe you sometimes regretted your education. Maybe you even resisted such discipline at times. You are aware that you cannot always act in the way you like, especially when other people are present.\nEtiquette and manners are two words we use to describe how we behave in social situations. You can have good or awful manners. Speaking while chewing food, for instance, is impolite. A rude individual is not popular. Keep in mind that manners and etiquette differ from culture to culture and from society to society.\nEtiquette and manners are lessons we pick up from our parents, families, and other institutions like schools, colleges, or professional organisations."

We learn etiquette and manners from our parents, families and various institutions, such as schools, colleges or professional bodies. There are rules of behaviour for all kinds of social occasions and it is important to learn them and practise them in everyday life. The manners that are correct in a wedding reception will not do in a debating club. Therefore, we have to be careful about etiquette and manners. We know how important it is to say 'please' and 'thank you' in everyday life.

For many different reasons, English has achieved the prestige of being that language. As a result, it has crossed national borders to reach people who speak other languages. It is no longer the unique possession of British or American people, but a language that belongs to the world's people. In fact, bilingual and multilingual users of English far outnumber its monolingual native speakers. This phenomenon has led to a bewildering variety of English around the world. As more and more people speak English, more and more varieties have emerged which are strongly influenced by the pronunciation, grammar and idioms of the respective mother tongues. World English has now moved away from the control of the native speakers. However, the question of British or American English is not so important now. Today's slogan is mutual intelligibility among users of the language.\n\n(a) obviously (synonym); (b) obviously (antonym); (c) prestige (synonym); (d) phenomenon (synonym); (e) unique (antonym); (f) belong (synonym); (g) outnumber (synonym); (h) monolingual (antonym); (i) native (antonym); (j) variety (synonym); (k) emerge (antonym); (l) control (antonym) (m) bewildering (synonym); (n) intelligibility (antonym).",

          "explanation": "Causes and Effects of Unemployment in Bangladesh\nUnemployment refers to the state of a person, capable of working, unable to find a paid job. In Bangladesh, unemployment still remains as one of the significant challenges. In order to address this issue hindering economic growth, the causes of unemployment need to be explored first. Rapid population growth is a major factor behind the unemployment rate. In comparison to the population, there are not enough job opportunities in the market. So, when a fresh graduate or anyone from the working-age enters the job market, the competition is quite fierce for a single seat. On the other hand, due to the digitalization of the country, laborers are being replaced with machines in the work field. Although automation helps businesses by improving its productivity and accuracy, it leaves a gap in the job market by reducing job opportunities. Lack of proper training and workoriented education are some of the other contributing factors regarding unemployment. The effect of unemployment falls directly on the economy of the country. Without a source of an income, unemployed people fail to provide themselves and their families with basic necessities. As a result, their standard of living meets no improvement. The pressure of finding a job and affording expenses collectively may cause extreme mental health issues for the people involved. It is a serious issue that the government cannot fix alone; we should all come forward to build a better nation by reducing unemployment in the country."

          "explanation": "One day, as I hurried toward my college to take my final exam at 10 am, the crisp morning air filled with anticipation. With just twenty minutes left before the exam, my mind raced through last-minute revision notes. Amidst the bustling city streets, I noticed a commotion ahead. A crowd had gathered around a frail old man who had collapsed onto the pavement. Without a second thought, I rushed to his side, joining others in assisting him.\nAs I knelt beside him, I could see he was in distress. His breathing was labored, and his face was pale. With the help of a passerby, we carefully lifted him onto a nearby bench. I asked someone to call for medical assistance while I stayed with him, offering what comfort I could.\nTime seemed to stretch as we waited for help to arrive. The old man's condition didn't seem to improve, and worry gnawed at me. But finally, the sound of sirens pierced through the air, signaling the arrival of paramedics. With practiced efficiency, they took over, assessing the situation and providing the urgent care he needed.\nRelieved that he was in capable hands, I glanced at my watch. The minutes had ticked away, and the clock was ticking closer to the start of my exam. Despite the urgency, I couldn't shake off the feeling that I couldn't leave until I knew the old man was stable. So, I stayed a while longer, watching as the paramedics worked tirelessly to stabilize him.\nOnce assured that he was in good hands, I thanked the paramedics and hurriedly made my way to college. Although I arrived slightly late, my professor understood the situation and allowed me to sit the exam. As I sat down and flipped open the exam paper, my mind was still filled with thoughts of the old man and the fragility of life."

She told me to go away Now she is married to another man. My father lives very far away. I want to go to him, but he won't take me either. I begged him to send me some money so that I could buy a bus ticket. I am still waiting. He has not answered: The streets are now my home. Sometimes I find work. I used to collect trash and sell it to a vendor. I stopped doing that after I had a serious infection and a doctor told me to stay away from the trash dump. Once I worked for an ice-cream shop owner and sold ice-cream on the beach. But I got no money in return. The owner of the shop gave me something to eat, and let me sleep in his hut at night. The work was difficult and painful. The ice-cream box is quite heavy when it is full. I had to walk for hours, offering my ice-cream to whoever wanted to buy.. There were days when I could not even sell one ice-cream. In a way, I am lucky because I am alive. My friends who work sorting rubbish in dumps often suffer from serious diseases. One of them was recently killed after he fell into a hole that opened up in the pile of trash. Many of us work for 10 to 12 hours, and get so little in return that we can't even buy food.",
