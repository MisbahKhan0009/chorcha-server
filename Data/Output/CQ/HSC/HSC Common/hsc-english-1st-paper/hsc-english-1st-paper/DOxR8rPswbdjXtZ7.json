      "uddipok": "Write a summary of the following text.\nThe famous Greek philosopher Aristotle said, \"Man is by nature a social animal.\" What he meant was that man, by instinct, seeks company of others and establishes relationships, much like most animals of the wild, for companionship and for physical and emotional support. Unlike the animals however, man's relationships give meaning to his existence and inspires him to do well in education, in workplace or in a profession that he pursues.\nRelationships are of different kinds. Some are familial and intimate, formed by blood and by marriage; some are social like the ones we have with friends and some are made in school where we, form close bonds with classmates and teachers. Relationships can also be fostered in workplace, which may quickly change from professional to social. There are relationships also between human beings and animals, between children and their toys that they cannot part with.\nAll these relationships keep us close to each other and provide us all kinds of support, love and affection. A person who has no family feels the pain of loneliness and isolation. There is no one to laugh or cry with him/her. When we share our joy with someone, it simply redoubles, and when we suffer a loss and someone shares our sorrow, it lessens. Relationships are thus needed for our emotional health.\nTo build relationships, we need to have trust and respect for each other, and love where this is needed. We cannot be selfish and possessive if we want to establish an effective relationship. But quite often we see people quarrelling and fighting with each other which only brings misery and loss to all.",

          "explanation": "The passage portrays the fact that human beings naturally develop different types of relationships through trust, respect and love. Relationships are formed by blood or marriage, in educational institutions or workplaces, etc. Relationships give meaning to our existence and inspire us to perform well in every stage. Moreover, relationships fill our life with love, support, and endearment. Lonely and isolated people cannot share their joy or sorrow. Through sharing, happiness increases, and sorrows decreases. Hence, relationships are essential for mental health. However, relationships with selfishness and possessiveness are detrimental to mental health and cause sufferings."

(One has been done for you):\nThe Island of St. Martin is the only coral island in Bangladesh located in the north-eastern part of Bay of Bengal. The roughly flat island is only above 3.6 metre above the sea level. The entire island can be walked about in 3 hours. The island is known for its unique natural beauty with white sandy beaches fringed with coconut palms and a diverse marine life. Due to the expansion of unregulated tourism, the island is facing increasing erosion, contamination of surface and ground water, wildlife displacement, and loss of biodiversity. Other threats include cutting of sand dune vegetation for fuel-wood and hotel establishment; degradation of sand dune habitat; the harvesting of turtle eggs; indiscriminate exploitation of coral resources etc. To address this, the Government has declared some areas of the island as Ecologically Critical Area (ECA), prohibiting unauthorized constructions there.\nOnly coral island in Bangladesh → 2. → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6",

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following passage:\nA plate of hot French fries and a huge burger with hot cheese oozing out of it, with a carbonated drink: looks like a treat! This calorie-rich junk food does look mouthwatering but is known to be nutritionally poor. Junk food or fast food has become an increasingly popular food choice. Ideally, junk foods are defined as processed foods with negligible nutrient value and are often high in salt, sugar and fat. But we often confuse fast foods with junk foods. How are they different? Or what is junk food really? Junk foods are processed foods consisting of high calories, but that is considered only as a broad umbrella. These foods are prepared in a way that they look appealing and are enjoyable so you are chemically programmed to ask for more. According to Dr. Sunali Sharma, a Dietician & Nutritionist, \"Commercial products including salted snack foods, chewing gum, candy, sugary desserts, fried fast food, and sweetened carbonated beverages that have little or no nutritional value but are high in calories, salt, and fats may be considered junk foods. Though not all fast foods are junk foods, a great number of them are. For instance, a salad may be fast food but is definitely not junk food. Some foods like burgers, pizzas, and tacos may alternate between junk and healthy categories depending on the ingredients, calories and process of manufacturing.\" Frequent consumption of junk food increases the intake of excess fat, simple carbohydrates, and processed sugar which may lead to a higher risk of obesity and cardiovascular diseases, among other chronic health problems. The resulting obesity may begin clogging up the arteries and lay the basis of an impending heart attack. It has also been suggested that eating junk food affects the brain in the same way as consuming addictive drugs. An addiction to junk food may even result in the rejection of healthier food options like fruits, vegetables, salads etc. leading to further lack of nourishment.",

For many different reasons, English has achieved the prestige of being that language. As a result, it has crossed national borders to reach people who speak other languages. It is no longer the unique possession of British or American people, but a language that belongs to the world's people. In fact, bilingual and multilingual users of English far outnumber its monolingual native speakers. This phenomenon has led to a bewildering variety of English around the world. As more and more people speak English, more and more varieties have emerged which are strongly influenced by the pronunciation, grammar and idioms of the respective mother tongues. World English has now moved away from the control of the native speakers. However, the question of British or American English is not so important now. Today's slogan is mutual intelligibility among users of the language.\n\n(a) obviously (synonym); (b) obviously (antonym); (c) prestige (synonym); (d) phenomenon (synonym); (e) unique (antonym); (f) belong (synonym); (g) outnumber (synonym); (h) monolingual (antonym); (i) native (antonym); (j) variety (synonym); (k) emerge (antonym); (l) control (antonym) (m) bewildering (synonym); (n) intelligibility (antonym).",

We were in a hilarious mood as we were talking about our plan to go on a picnic. Suddenly, we noticed an old woman who was begging money for his ailing son. It was hard for us to turn a blind eye. Her torn clothes and sad face brought tears to our eyes and we decided to help her. When we asked her about her son, she replied that her son was a garments worker and had been crippled due to an accident in the factory. The owner did not provide any compensation, and since then, she had to beg for buying foods and medicine for her son. All of us felt sorrow for the unfortunate woman and gave her the money we saved for the picnic. Then, we again started for the college while thanking the Almighty about our privileged lives.\nWe have our health, a roof over our head, foods on table and a million other blessings to count. It is the duty of the wealthy and the privileged section of the society to come forward to aid these unfortunate people."

I understand that you're feeling apprehensive about English, but I'm here to assure you that with a bit of effort and the right approach, you can become competent in English.\nFirstly, it's essential to change your mindset about learning English. Instead of seeing it as a daunting task, try to view it as a fun and exciting journey.

Start Small : Begin by learning basic vocabulary and common phrases. You can use flashcards, language learning apps, or online resources to help you memorize words.\n2. Practice Regularly : Consistency is key. Try to dedicate a little time each day to practice reading, writing, listening, and speaking in English. You can read English books or articles, listen to podcasts or songs, and even engage in conversations with English speakers if possible.\n3. Set Realistic Goals : Set achievable goals for yourself, such as learning a certain number of new words each week or improving your pronunciation. Celebrate your progress along the way to stay motivated.\n4. Immerse Yourself : Surround yourself with English as much as possible. Watch English movies or TV shows, listen to English radio stations, and try to think in English. Immersion can significantly accelerate your learning process.\n5. Don't Be Afraid to Make Mistakes : Remember that making mistakes is part of learning any new language. Don't let fear hold you back from practicing or speaking English. Embrace your errors as opportunities to improve.\n6. Seek Feedback : If you have the opportunity, ask for feedback from English speakers or teachers. Constructive criticism can help you identify areas for improvement and refine your skills.\n7. Stay Motivated : Find reasons to stay motivated, whether it's to advance your career, communicate with people from different cultures, or simply challenge yourself. Remind yourself of your goals and the benefits of learning English.\nAbir, I believe in you. Learning English may seem daunting at first, but with perseverance and dedication, you'll undoubtedly become more competent in the language. Feel free to reach out to me if you need any support or encouragement along the way.\nBest wishes,\nMahin"
