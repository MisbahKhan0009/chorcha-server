It typically contains a lot of sugar, salt, unhealthy fats, and artificial additives, while lacking essential nutrients like vitamins, minerals, and fiber.\n\n(b) Eating junk food has been compared to consuming addictive drugs because it triggers the brain’s reward system by releasing dopamine, a feel-good chemical. This can create cravings and make people want to eat more, leading to habits similar to addiction.\n\n(c) Common ingredients in junk foods include:\nHigh levels of Salt sugar\n(sodium)\nUnhealthy fats (like trans fats and saturated fats)\nRefined flour\nArtificial flavors, colors, and preservatives\n(d) People tend to eat more junk food because it is:\nTasty and appealing\nEasily accessible and convenient\nAdvertised heavily\nIt stimulates cravings due to sugar and fat content, which activates the brain's pleasure centers.\n(e) Junk food is banned in certain places (like schools or hospitals) to protect public health because:\nIt contributes to obesity , heart disease , diabetes , and other health problems.\nIt promotes unhealthy eating habits , especially in children.\nBans encourage people to choose nutrient-rich alternatives."

      "uddipok": "Education gives us knowledge and a set of abilities to function meaningfully in life, such as the ability to decide things rationally and make the right choices.) As we learn how to read, write and do the basic operations of arithmetic, we gain a degree of self-confidence. We learn to think for ourselves and articulate our thoughts, we pick up skills to communicate with others and manage our affairs as well. Education helps us think independently and make our own opinions. As we know more about the world, we appreciate the good things it offers us but also become critical of the deviations from the values it imparts and the rise of hatred or conflict that follows. The first thing education does is to give us an awareness about ourselves which leads to the development of our personality. As we begin school, we feel the need to belong to the class and make friends. We then expand our sense of belonging to include the school at large, our community and finally our country. Education thus prepares every child to become an active member of the community and work for its welfare.\n1. Ability to decide things rationally → 2. →3. →4→ 5→.6",

Some are familial and intimate, formed by blood and by marriage, some are social like the ones we have with friends and some are made in school where we form close bonds with classmates and teachers. Relationships can also be fostered in workplace, which may quickly change from professional to social. There are relationships also between human beings and animals, between children and their toys that they cannot part with. All these relationships keep us close to each other and provide us all kinds of support, love and affection. A person who has no family feels the pains of loneliness and isolation. There is no one to laugh or cry with him/her. When we share our joy with someone, it simply redoubles, and when we suffer a loss and someone shares our sorrow, it lessens. Relationships are thus needed for our emotional health.",

          "explanation": "Relationships come in many forms, including family bonds, friendships, school connections, and workplace interactions. They can also exist between humans and animals or even between children and their favorite toys. These relationships provide love, support, and affection, helping us stay connected. Without relationships, a person may experience loneliness and isolation. Sharing happiness with others doubles joy, while sharing sorrow lessens pain. Therefore, relationships are essential for our emotional well-being."

From 1995 to around 2005, the number grew slowly, reaching about 400 students. However, from 2005 onwards, the number of overseas students increased rapidly. By 2010, the figure reached approximately 800, showing significant growth.\nThe most dramatic rise occurred between 2010 and 2015, with the number of overseas students soaring to around 1200. After 2015, the number of students leveled off, remaining close to 1200 until 2020, where it shows a slight decline.\nOverall, the graph highlights a steady increase in overseas students for the first decade, followed by a rapid rise and then a plateau in recent years. This pattern may reflect growing global interest in higher education abroad, followed by stabilization due to factors such as university capacity or changing policies."

I am excited to tell you about the foods and food habits here in Bangladesh.\nBangladesh has a rich variety of delicious foods. Rice is the staple food, and we usually eat it with lentils called dal, and different types of vegetables or fish curries. Fish is very popular here because of our many rivers. Some famous dishes are hilsa fish curry, biryani, and panta bhat (fermented rice eaten with salt and onion).\nPeople here love spicy and flavorful food. Meals are often eaten with the right hand, and it is common to share food with family and friends. We usually have three main meals a day, and snacks like samosas or puffed rice are enjoyed in the evening.\nI hope someday you can visit Bangladesh and try our tasty food!\nTake care and write soon.\nYour friend, Zaman\n"
