      "uddipok": "Summarize the following text.\nValentina Tereshkova was born in a village, in Central Russia on 6 March 1937. Her father was a tractor driver and her mother worked in a textile plant. At the age of eight she began her schooling but did not enjoy it much. She left the school within a few years. Afterwards she completed her education through distance learning. She became interested in parachuting from a young age, and trained in skydiving at the local Aeroclub, making her first jump at age 22 on 21 May 1959. It was her expertise in skydiving that led to her selection as a cosmonaut.After the flight of Yuri Gagarin, the first human being to travel to outer space in April 1961, the Soviet Union decided to send a woman in space. On 16 February 1962, \"proletaria\" Valentina Tereshkova was selected for this project from among more than four hundred applicants. Tereshkova had to undergo a series of training that included weightless flights, isolation tests, centrifuge tests, rocket theory, spacecraft engineering, 120 parachute jumps and pilot training in MiG-15UTI jet fighters. Since the successful launch of the spacecraft Vostok-5 on 14 June 1963, Tereshkova began preparing for her own flight. On the morning of 16 June 1963, Tereshkova and her. back-up cosmonaut Solovyova were dressed in space-suits and taken to the space shuttle launch pad by a bus. After completing her communication and life support checks, she was sealed inside Vostok-6. Finishing a two-\nhour countdown, Vostok-6 launched faultlessly. Although Tereshkova experienced nausea and physical discomfort for much of the flight, she orbited the earth 48 times and spent almost three days in space. With a single flight, she logged more flight time than the combined times of all American astronauts who had flown before that date. Tereshkova also maintained a flight log and took photographs of the horizon, which were later used to identify aerosol layers within the atmosphere. Vostok-6 was the final Vostok flight and was launched two days after Vostok-5, which carried Valary Bykovsky into a similar orbit for five days, landing three hours after Tereshkova. The two vessels approached each other within 5 kilometers at one point, and from space Tereshkova communicated with Bykovsky and the Soviet leader Khrushchev by radio.",

Passionate about parachuting, she trained extensively and made her first jump at 22. Selected as a cosmonaut in 1962, she underwent rigorous training. On June 16, 1963, she boarded Vostok-6, becoming the first woman in space. Despite feeling discomfort, she orbited Earth 48 times in nearly three days, contributing valuable data. Her flight time surpassed combined American astronaut times. Tereshkova's achievements marked a significant milestone in space exploration."

He groomed himself up as a young man who earned success by dint of perseverance and commitment. When the Pakistan military began its genocide in Bangladesh, he joined the Liberation War and received military training at Camp Murtee located at the Himalayan foothills in India. The tall young man who carried himself with dignity and possessed remarkable traits of leadership became the ADC of General Ataul Goni, Osmani, the Commander in Chief of Bangladesh Armed Forces during the Liberation War. After Independence, Sheikh Kamal could, easily remain in Bangladesh Army and pass a secure life but he preferred to engage himself in country building and organizing the young forces to that end, Journalist Syed Ishtiaq Rezi in one of his columns 'Ekjon Sheikh Kamal' in Bangla Tribune rightly says that the unique qualities of Sheikh Kamal's character, especially his wholehearted involvement in sports and culture are never seen in any son or daughter of any President, Prime Minister or High Officials in Bangladesh.",

      "uddipok": "Read the following text and make a flow chart showing the features of dream. (One is done for you.)\nDreams have fascinated philosophers for thousands of years, but only recently have dreams been subjected to empirical research and scientific study. Chances are that you've often found yourself puzzling over the content of a dream, or perhaps you've' wondered why you dream at all. First, let's start by answering a basic question: What is a dream? A dream can include any of the images, thoughts and emotions that are experienced during sleep. Dreams. can be extraordinarily vivid or very vague; filled with joyful emotions or frightening images, focused and understandable or unclear and confusing.\nWhy do we dream? What purpose do dreams serve? While many theories have been proposed no consensus has emerged. Considering the time. we spend in a dreaming state, the fact that researchers do not yet understand the purpose of dreams may seem baffling. However, it is important to consider that science is still unraveling the exact purpose and function of sleep itself: Some researchers suggest that dreams serve no real purpose, while others believe that dreaming is essential to mental, emotional and physical well-being.\nNext, let's learn more about some of the most prominent dream theories. Consistent with the psychoanalytic perspective, Sigmund Freud's theory of dreams suggests that dreams are a representation of subconscious desires, thoughts and motivations. According to Freud, people are driven by aggressive and sexual instincts that are repressed from conscious awareness. While these thoughts are not consciously expressed, they find their way into our awareness via dreams. In his famous book The Interpretation of Dreams (1899). Freud wrote that dreams are \"..... disguised fulfilments of repressed wishes.\"\nFull of thoughts, images and emotions→\n2.→\n3.→\n4.→\n5.→\n6.",

At last it found a jar in a garden. It became very pleased. It flew down and sat on the jar. But alas! There was a little water at the bottom of the jar and it was out of its reach. Hence, it tried to turn the jar over again and again but brought no result. After several efforts, the crow got tired and disappointed. In despair when it was about to leave the place, it noticed a heap of pebbles nearby. It got hope and hit upon a plan. The crow picked up some pebbles and started dropping into the jar one after another. As a result, the water of the jar rose up little by little. When the water came to the brim of the jar, the crow drank its heart content and flew away.\n\n\nIn this way, the strong will of the crow helped it to meet its thirst.\n"

It brings some relief from the heat, but it can also make it a bit gloomy to stay cooped up inside. That's when I really appreciate having a good newspaper to keep me informed and entertained.\nSpeaking of newspapers, I know you're not a big reader of them. But I wanted to write to you about all the benefits I've found from making it a daily habit. It's not just about the news anymore, although that's important too. Here are a few things I've noticed:\nStaying Informed: The world is a busy place, and newspapers help me stay updated on current events, both local and international. It gives me a broader perspective on what's happening and helps me understand the world around me better.\nImproving Vocabulary: Newspapers are full of rich vocabulary and interesting writing styles. Reading them regularly exposes me to new words and helps me improve my own communication skills.\nStaying Sharp: Reading itself is a great mental exercise, and newspapers offer a variety of content that keeps my mind active. From analyzing news articles to solving puzzles, it's a workout for the brain.\nLearning New Things: Newspapers cover a wide range of topics, from science and technology to history and culture. Every day, I learn something new and interesting that I might not have otherwise encountered.\nI know you might be busy, but even starting with just 15-20 minutes a day can make a difference. Maybe you could focus on sections that interest you most, like sports or technology. There are even digital versions of some newspapers available now, which might be more convenient for you.\nGive it a try, Nayon! You might be surprised at how much you enjoy it and how much you learn.\nWrite back and let me know what you think.\nBest,\nShimul"
