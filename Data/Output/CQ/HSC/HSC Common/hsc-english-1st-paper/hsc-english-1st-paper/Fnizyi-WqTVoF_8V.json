          "explanation": "The pie chart displays the various sources of air pollution in a city, highlighting five key contributors. Vehicles are by far the most significant source, accounting for 60% of total air pollution. This indicates a heavy reliance on private and commercial transportation, possibly due to limited public transport infrastructure. Industry is the second-largest contributor at 18% , reflecting emissions from factories and manufacturing units. Power plants contribute 13% , suggesting that electricity generation—likely from fossil fuels—is another major pollutant. Waste disposal activities are responsible for 3% , while heating or using gas contributes nothing ( 0% ), showing negligible or highly controlled emissions in that category.\nThe disparity is stark: vehicles alone contribute more than all other sources combined, underscoring the urgent need for cleaner transport alternatives and stricter vehicular emission controls. In contrast, waste disposal and gas usage have a minimal impact, suggesting these are not major areas of concern. Targeted interventions in transport and industry could significantly improve air quality."

          "explanation": "Title: The Ant and the Dove\nAn ant lived on the bank of a river. The level of water in the river was increasing gradually. One day, a wave struck the shore. At that moment, the ant was walking. It slipped into the water and began to struggle desperately. The current was strong, and the poor ant was about to drown.\nJust then, a dove sitting on a nearby tree saw the ant in danger. Moved by compassion, the dove quickly plucked a leaf from the tree and dropped it into the river near the ant. The ant climbed onto the leaf and floated safely to the shore. It looked up at the dove with gratitude and silently promised to return the kindness someday.\nA few days later, a hunter came to the riverbank with a net. He aimed his weapon at the same dove resting peacefully on a branch. The ant noticed it and knew it had to act fast. It crawled to the hunter’s foot and bit him sharply. Startled, the hunter missed his aim, and the dove flew away to safety.\nThus, the ant repaid the dove’s kindness. Both went on with their lives, grateful for each other.\nMoral: A good deed is never forgotten."

          "explanation": "10 Jahnson Road, Dhaka-1100\n28 June 2023\nDear Robi,\nHope, you and your loved ones are fine. We are also doing fine here. I'm writing this letter to you to ventilate something about an unusual day I passed a few days ago.\nLast Thursday was just a nightmare for me. Everything seemed out to get me, to plot against me. My 1st Year Final Exam was running. I was burning midnight oil for my Physics test. I got up late in the morning and my head felt dizzy. Looking at the alarm clock, I was dumbfounded (হতবাক). I had just ten minutes to board the college bus. Scrambling from bed, I completed my morning chores in a jiffy (মুহুর্তের মধ্যে). I had hardly put on my pants when the horn of the college bus honked. Clutching my bag, I hounded out of home, but to my dismay the bus was nowhere in sight. Rushing back. I entreated (সবিনয় অনুরোধ করা) my father to drop me to college in his car. He agreed grudgingly after giving me a short lecture on my being careless. On reaching the classroom, I took my seat and settled down for the test. The question paper left me dumb struck. Am I hallucinating? I glanced at my wrist watch, the date was alright but the test stated was not physics, it's maths. The earth seemed to ship under my feet as I tried to come to term with catastrophe. I, however, gathered my wits and began to attempt questions with shaky hands. Somehow I finished the test and in no time the Monitor handed me a letter of half-hour detention for being late for college which meant catching a public bus for home. And it was another shattering experience for me which was difficult to depict.\nThat's all for today.\nEver yours,\nEnam"

These songs are also about social inequality and poverty, about the material world and the supernatural. Mystical songs have been composed using the metaphors of rivers and boats. Since the country is basically riverine, the Bhatiyali forms an important genre of folk music. Nature plays a role in providing the content and rhythm of folk music. The folk music of Bangladesh varies from region to region, reflecting changes in the natural environment and the dialects people use. Thus there are the northern Bhawaiya, the eastern Bhatiyali and the southwestern Baul songs.\nSongs reflecting rural and riverine life→\n2→\n3→\n4→\n5→\n6",

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following text:\nBeauty is easy to appreciate but difficult to define. As we look around, we discover beauty in pleasurable objects and sights – in nature, in the laughter of children, in the kindness of strangers. But asked to define, we run into difficulties. Does beauty have an independent objective identity? Is it universal, or is it dependent on our sense perceptions? Does it lie in the eye of the beholder? We ask ourselves. A further difficulty arises when beauty manifests itself not only by its presence, but by its absence as well, as when we are repulsed by ugliness and desire beauty. But then ugliness has as much a place in our lives as beauty, or may be more ————- as when there is widespread hunger and injustice in a society. Philosophers have told us that beauty is an important part of life, but isn't ugliness a part of life too? And if art has beauty as an important ingredient, can it confine itself only to a projection of beauty? Can art ignore what is not beautiful?",

          "explanation": "Beauty is something appreciable but quite indefinable. In our surroundings, beauty can be seen in various enjoyable forms. But defining it on one's part is very difficult. Various types of questions about its existence, form and shape move around our mind. We are moved not only by its presence but also by its absence. So, ugliness occupies as much a place in our life as beauty. Though beauty is an important part of art, art cannot ignore ugliness."
