          "explanation": "The pie chart provides information about the percentages of types of transportation used by 800 students to come to college. From the graph, we cansee that the highest number of students come to college on bicycle which is about 45%. Then, the second position is claimed by the bus. Around 30% of the total students come to college by bus. On the other hand, the students who live near the college campus usually come to college on foot and their number is around 15%. Students of some rich families come to college by car. Their number is 10% of the total students. Hence, from the information of the graph, we can say that the communication system of the college is quite good. Again, we can say that most of the students reside near the college and so, they can come to college by bicycle, by bus, or on foot."

By chance it ran over the face of the lion. It awoke the lion. At this the lion grew very angry with the silly mouse. The mouse became very much frightened. But he did not lose heart. He said to the lion, \"O king of the jungle, I am a very tiny creature. I made a great mistake, please forgive me this time. I may be of some help to you any time in future. Even the smallest creatures can be of great help to the giants.\" Hearing this the lion smiled and let the mouse go. Days, months and years passed by. One night the mouse heard the roar of a lion. The mouse went to the place from where the sound was coming. Having reached there, it saw the lion trapped in a hunter's net. The net was too strong for the lion to tear. The mouse gave its identity and requested him not to make any sound. Then the mouse began to cut the rope with its sharp teeth. The lion was freed before dawn (ভোর). The lion expressed his gratitude (কৃতজ্ঞতা) to the mouse."

      "uddipok": "Write a summary of the following passage.\nEducation aims to bring about positive changes in our behavior. It helps us try to change our lives as well as the society we live in. Education that does not illuminate our minds or does not inspire us to work for the community is not complete at all. Education is not all about getting grades or receiving certificates- we use education to make life better. We are expected to apply the knowledge, skills and values that we learn in a classroom in our engagement with the world that lies outside. And we can do so in many different ways. Let's have a look at how education works. Learners' civic engagement is highly appreciated all over the world. Civic engagement means working to make a difference in the civic life (the public life of the citizens as constructed with private or personal life) of the community using knowledge, skills, values and motivation. Civic engagement promotes the quality of life in a community by contributing to the improvement of health and wellbeing of the people.\nCivically engaged individuals recognize themselves as members of a larger social community and are concerned about civic issues. They consider themselves responsible citizens who take action or raise their voices against injustice, discrimination and other forms of social ills.\nIn civic engagement, issues of public concern are crucial. Civic engagement includes individual or group activities to protect public interests and change the way the community values itself. For example, If you are protesting against any unjust decision of the local municipality such as raising taxes or an act that might work against people's interests, you are civically engaged and your action is considered a civic engagement. This protest can be done in different ways such as organizing rallies, collecting signatures, making human chains, writing petitions, etc. You can also help control traffic in front of a school, help children to cross the roads, work in a team to clean a park or a sea beach. You can also give some services to elderly people. These are all examples of civic engagement as what you do directly affects the community.\nWhen civic engagement is a part of an academic program, and the learners' engagement is assessed following a scale, then it is called service learning. It involves the application of knowledge and skills learned in the classroom and then making a complete plan of action 1.e. preparing a budget, starting the process of implementation, involving people and activating operational strategies.",

The Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. The Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. So, we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.... I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal. I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of 'interposition' and 'nullification', that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.\"",

He hopes that former slaves' children and former slave owners' children will live peacefully together. He dreams that every state will become fair and that  his children will be judged by their character, not by their skin color.

          "question": "",
          "explanation": "\n(a)\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines adolescence as the period of life between 10 and 19 years of age. This stage marks the transition from childhood to adulthood, characterized by significant physical, emotional, and social development. Adolescents experience rapid growth and undergo various changes that influence their health, behavior, and interactions with society.\n(b)\nAccording to the 2022 Bangladesh Census, the population of adolescents aged 10–14 is approximately 16.6 million, with 8.5 million boys and 7.8 million girls. For the 15–19 age group, there are about 16.5 million adolescents, comprising 8.1 million boys and 8.5 million girls. In total, adolescents make up about 28.8% of Bangladesh's population, with a near-equal distribution between boys and girls.\n(c)\nAdolescent girls in Bangladesh face several challenges\nChild Marriage : Approximately 51% of girls in Bangladesh are married before the age of 18, making it one of the highest rates globally.\nEducation : While enrollment rates for girls have improved, many still face barriers to completing secondary education, especially in rural areas.\nHealth Risks : Early pregnancies pose significant health risks, with many adolescent girls becoming mothers before reaching adulthood.\nViolence and Abuse : A significant number of adolescent girls experience physical or sexual violence, often within intimate relationships.\nThese issues hinder their development and access to opportunities, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.\n(d)\nIn Bangladesh, the legal age for marriage is 18 for girls and 21 for boys, as stipulated by the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 2017. However, the law includes provisions that allow for exceptions under certain circumstances, such as parental consent and court approval, which have been criticized for potentially undermining efforts to prevent child marriage.\n(e)\nWhile the legal age for marriage is 21 for boys in Bangladesh, readiness for marriage is influenced by various factors beyond age, including emotional maturity, financial stability, and societal expectations. Cultural norms often dictate that men should be established in their careers and capable of supporting a family before marriage. However, these expectations can vary widely across different communities and regions within the country."
