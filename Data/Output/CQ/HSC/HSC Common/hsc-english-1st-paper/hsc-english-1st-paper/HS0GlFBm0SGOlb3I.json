          "explanation": "The bar graph illustrates the steady increase in the number of internet users in Bangladesh from 2014 to 2019. The graph shows that in 2014, there were around 40 million users, which increased to approximately 60 million by 2015. Then, the number of users suddenly decreased and reached 50 million in 2016. Only this particular year marks a decrease in the number of users. Then, a significant surge occurred in 2017 and the number of internet users jumped to 70 million. This marks an increase highlighting a rapid growth in internet accessibility and usage. The number of users remained same in 2018. Finally, in 2019, the number of internet users took another jump and turned into 80 million in total. Analysing the graph, we find that within five years, the number of internet users in Bangladesh increased significantly, making it double. It is a clear indication that during this period, the country's digital infrastructure improved significantly. It also shows that people of Bangladesh are. getting accustomed to the modern technologies."

          "explanation": "Bayazid's Love for His Mother\nOnce, there was a little boy named Bayazid. One night, he was studying by the side of the bed of his mother. His ailing mother was sleeping. All on a sudden, she woke up, raised her head and told him to give her a glass of water. Bayazid went to the kitchen to bring water but the pitcher was empty. He thought to fetch water from a distant fountain. He went alone to the fountain with the pitcher and came back home with the pitcher full of water. In the meantime, his mother was fast asleep again. He did not want to disturb his ailing mother. So, he remained standing whole night beside his mother's bed. In the morning, Bayazid's mother awoke. She became astonished to see her son standing with the glass full of water beside her bed. She embraced her son with deep love and prayed to Almighty Allah for her son. In his later life, Bayazid became a great saint."

All sorts of books such as fictions, novels, dramas, poems and books of medicine, engineering. politics, history, general knowledge, etc, were brought for display and sale in Ekushey Boi Mela. The book fair became crowdy specially in the evening. Both male and female customers gathered ( জড়ো হওয়া ) in Ekushey Boi Mela. Many writers also visited the fair. When I bought a novel from a stall, I noticed a big gathering in front of a particular stall which was for the writers. I went there and saw that Imdadul Haq Milan, a famous novelist, was present there and was giving autographs to the people over there. I also became interested in having his autograph but due to long line of people, I checked my wish. Afterwards, I enjoyed a cultural function. In fact, I enjoyed a lot visiting the Ekushey Boi Mela.\nNo more today. With much love.\nYours ever,\nEnum"

The Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. The Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. So, we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.... I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal. I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of 'interposition' and 'nullification', that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.\"",

It turned out to be of such exquisite workmanship that people from far and near crowded round for a look. Some said, \"This is education par excellence.\" Others said, \"Even if it learns nothing, it has got the cage. What a lucky bird.\"\nThe goldsmith was delighted to get a bagful of money as reward and went home at once. A teacher came to give lessons to the bird. He took a pinch of snuff and declared, \"This isn't a matter of just a few texts.\" One of the royal nephews sent for scribes. They made multiple copies of various texts until there was a veritable mountain. \"Bravo!\" exclaimed those who saw it. \"There is no room for any more knowledge.\" The scribes loaded their wages onto bullocks and merrily headed home. They would never want for anything .The nephews were constantly busy looking after the expensive cage. Repairs were always under way. Anyone who saw the endless dusting, wiping and polishing had to agree that there was \"marked improvement\". A large maintenance crew was needed, and more personnel to supervise them. They all got handsome monthly salaries, which they saved in their wooden chests. Even their cousins came to live with them in cushioned comfort.",
