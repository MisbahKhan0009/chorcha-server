          "explanation": "The Honesty of a Student\nOne day, a boy named Shafi of class twelve was going to college. Suddenly, he saw a money purse dropped by someone on the road. He was quite at a loss to see the purse and decided to pick it up. He was not at all greedy and so was not in the least interested in grabbing the contents in the purse. He intended to open the purse to see if there was any visiting card. Fortunately, he found some visiting cards and ID card of the owner. Then the boy became somewhat pacified thinking that he might eventually return the purse to its real owner. However, the boy carried the bag to his parents. His parents were very pious and honest who were bringing up their son with proper moral and religious education. His father Mr. Sumon found the owner's address and mobile number on the visiting card. He called the number. The man who received phone sounded very anxious. Mr. Sumon asked him about his identity. Mr. Sumon noticed that the identity of the man corresponded with the visiting card and ID card. And the man's name was Mr. Rashid. Mr. Sumon asked Mr. Rashid if he had lost anything. Mr. Rashid anxiously replied that he had lost a purse containing a great amount of money and some documentary papers. Mr. Rashid's information completely corresponded (সংগতিপূর্ণ হওয়া) with the contents of the purse. M r \\mathrm{Mr} Mr . Sumon was certain that he (Mr. Rashid) was the real owner of the purse. He (Mr. Sumon) told him (Mr. Rashid) not to worry about the purse, adding that he (Mr. Rashid) would get back everything. Then Mr. Sumon told him to come to his (Mr. Sumon) address to receive his purse. Mr. Rashid and his wife at once started for Mr. Sumon's house. Mr. Sumon handed over the purse to Mr. Rashid. Mr. Rashid was overwhelmed with gratefulness and hugged Mr. Sumon. Mr. Rashid appreciated the boy for his honesty. Since then the two families developed a great friendly relationship between themselves."

      "uddipok": "Tertiary education in Bangladesh comprises two categories of institutions: degree awarding universities and colleges affiliated with the National University (NU). There were only 4 universities in Bangladesh at the time of independence in 1971. All of those universities were publicly financed autonomous entities. At present, there are 35 such universities. Private universities are a relatively new phenomenon in this country. In the early 1990s, the private sector came forward to establish universities. Since then the country has experienced a spectacular growth in private universities mostly in and around Dhaka and couple of other large cities. At present, there are 79 private universities. The number of colleges providing tertiary level education is around 1,400. Most of them offer BA (pass) education of three year duration: only one-third of them offer BA (Honors) courses and some offer MA degrees as well. All of these colleges are affiliated with the National University, Accessibility to higher education implies that students get the opportunity to get university education and sufficient support from educational institutions. Increasing enrolment at the secondary and higher secondary level puts pressure on higher educational institutions. But due to limited capacity, only a small number of students may be enrolled in universities. Thus, each year a large number of students are denied access to higher education. Also, due to poverty and increase in educational expenses. students of the lower middle class do not get easy access to higher education. Moreover, those who get places in the universities have limited access to avall all kinds of diversified educational facilities relating to their study fields.\nOnly about 12 percent of graduates enter higher educational institutions. More than 80 per cent of these students are admitted to NU affliated colleges. Others are absorbed by the public and private universities. In the last two decades, there has been a substantial rise in the number of students in private universities. According to the UGC Annual Report 2010, the number rose from 88,669 in 2005 to 2 , 00 , 752 2,00,752 2 , 00 , 752 in 2010.\nPublic universities are the first choices of most students. The public universities offer a wide range of subjects in Science, Commerce, Liberal Arts, Humanities, Engineering and Technology. Law, Education and Medicine. Public universities attract the best minds to teaching although monetary compensation for teachers is anything but attractive. Library, laboratory. Internet and research facilities are much better there than anywhere else in the country. Seminars, symposiums, lectures; workshops, debates, and exhibitions are often held in these institutions and there is ample scope for national and international exposure for promising young knowledge seekers. Moreover, public universities offer residential and boarding facilities at low cost/subsidized rates.",

You must also have been taught to be polite in company and keep quiet while others, especially your elders, spoke. Possibly, you at times grudged such schooling. Possibly, at times you even protested such disciplining. Now, certainly you know that you can't always behave the way you want specially in the presence of others. There are rules of behavior you have to follow in a company. We are social beings and have to consider the effect of our behavior on others, even if we are at home and dealing with our family members.\nWe have two terms to describe our social behavior- 'etiquette' and 'manners'. 'Etiquette' is a French word and it means the rules of correct behavior in society. The word 'manners' means the behavior that is considered to be polite in a particular society or culture.\nManners can be good or bad. For example, it is a bad manner to speak with food in one's mouth. No one likes a bad mannered person. Remember that etiquette and manners vary from culture to culture and from society to society.",

          "explanation": "Summary:\nYou must have been taught as a young child to greet your elders and house guests in accordance with your culture and custom. Additionally, you must have been taught to be polite in public and to be silent when others, particularly your elders, spoke. Maybe you sometimes regretted your education. Maybe you even resisted such discipline at times. You are aware that you cannot always act in the way you like, especially when other people are present.\nEtiquette and manners are two words we use to describe how we behave in social situations. You can have good or awful manners. Speaking while chewing food, for instance, is impolite. A rude individual is not popular. Keep in mind that manners and etiquette differ from culture to culture and from society to society.\nEtiquette and manners are lessons we pick up from our parents, families, and other institutions like schools, colleges, or professional organisations."

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following text.\nThe term 'diaspora' is used to refer to people who have left their homelands and settled in other parts of the world, either because they were forced to do so or because they wanted to leave on their own. The word is increasingly used for such people as a collective group or a community. The world has seen many diasporas but scholars have been studying the phenomenon with great interest only in recent decades. Among the great diasporas of history is that of the Jewish people, who were forced to leave their lands in ancient times. The movement of Aryans from Central Europe to the Indian sub-continent thousands of years ago is also noteworthy diaspora, although the causes of this diaspora is unclear. In twentieth century history, the Palestinian diaspora has attracted a lot of attention and been a cause of concern for world leaders because of the plight of Palestinians. There have been massive diasporas in Africa, too, over the centuries, either because of war or because of the ravages of nature. But the chief reason why the phenomenon of diaspora is attracting so much attention now is globalization",

          "explanation": "Diaspora represents the people who have left their homelands and settled in other parts of the world. The diasporas take shelter in foreign countries leaving their ancestral land, either because they are forced to leave their country or they leave willingly. Among the great diasporas of history, the Jewish Diaspora is highly remarkable. Again, the Aryans left their homeland, Central Europe, thousands of years ago, and settled in the Indian sub-continent. In twentieth century, the Palestinian Diaspora has drawn the attention of the world leaders because of the plight and miseries of the Palestinians. However, globalization has contributed much to the recent attention to diasporas."
