          "explanation": "The pie chart displays the various sources of air pollution in a city, highlighting five key contributors. Vehicles are by far the most significant source, accounting for 60% of total air pollution. This indicates a heavy reliance on private and commercial transportation, possibly due to limited public transport infrastructure. Industry is the second-largest contributor at 18% , reflecting emissions from factories and manufacturing units. Power plants contribute 13% , suggesting that electricity generation—likely from fossil fuels—is another major pollutant. Waste disposal activities are responsible for 3% , while heating or using gas contributes nothing ( 0% ), showing negligible or highly controlled emissions in that category.\nThe disparity is stark: vehicles alone contribute more than all other sources combined, underscoring the urgent need for cleaner transport alternatives and stricter vehicular emission controls. In contrast, waste disposal and gas usage have a minimal impact, suggesting these are not major areas of concern. Targeted interventions in transport and industry could significantly improve air quality."

          "explanation": "\nOnce there lived a happy cobbler who passed his day working and singing from morning to night. His firm belief was that money cannot bring happiness. Happiness lies in contentment. A rich neighbor of his was a banker who one day came and said to him,” How much a year do you earn?” The cobbler replied, “I don’t know and I never think in that way as I live from hand to mouth.” The banker said, \"I am very sorry for your poverty. You should try to change your fortune.” The cobbler laughed and said, \"I am happy with what I can earn daily.” The next day the banker came again and said, “Look, my friend! I want to drive away your distress. Take these thousand pounds, keep it carefully and use it in time of need.\"\nThe cobbler became very much surprised having the large amount. He had never seen so much money at a time in his life before. At first, he could not think where he should hide the money for safety. Then, he dug a hole in his hut and buried it.\nAt night, a new thinking crossed over his mind, “someone might steal my money.” As a result, he could not sleep at all.\n\n\nNext few days, he could neither do any work nor sleep at night for the thinking of money. At last, he could realize that the money had snatched away his mental peace and happiness. So, one morning he went to the banker’s house and returned the money. From then, he could pass his days with singing and great happiness as before.\nMoral Of the Story: Money cannot bring happiness. Happiness lies in the self contentment.\n"

Recently I have visited the Ekushey Boi Mela. Now, I am going to tell you about it.\nI went to Ekushey Boi Mela held at Bangla Academy premises on the occasion of 21 st February. About two hundred stalls were there. All sorts of books such as fictions, novels, dramas, poems and books of medicine, engineering. politics, history, general knowledge, etc, were brought for display and sale in Ekushey Boi Mela. The book fair became crowdy specially in the evening. Both male and female customers gathered ( জড়ো হওয়া ) in Ekushey Boi Mela. Many writers also visited the fair. When I bought a novel from a stall, I noticed a big gathering in front of a particular stall which was for the writers. I went there and saw that Imdadul Haq Milan, a famous novelist, was present there and was giving autographs to the people over there. I also became interested in having his autograph but due to long line of people, I checked my wish. Afterwards, I enjoyed a cultural function. In fact, I enjoyed a lot visiting the Ekushey Boi Mela.\nNo more today. With much love.\nYours ever,\nEnum"

      "uddipok": "Read the following text and make a flow chart showing the features of dream. (One is done for you.)\nDreams have fascinated philosophers for thousands of years, but only recently have dreams been subjected to empirical research and scientific study. Chances are that you've often found yourself puzzling over the content of a dream, or perhaps you've' wondered why you dream at all. First, let's start by answering a basic question: What is a dream? A dream can include any of the images, thoughts and emotions that are experienced during sleep. Dreams. can be extraordinarily vivid or very vague; filled with joyful emotions or frightening images, focused and understandable or unclear and confusing.\nWhy do we dream? What purpose do dreams serve? While many theories have been proposed no consensus has emerged. Considering the time. we spend in a dreaming state, the fact that researchers do not yet understand the purpose of dreams may seem baffling. However, it is important to consider that science is still unraveling the exact purpose and function of sleep itself: Some researchers suggest that dreams serve no real purpose, while others believe that dreaming is essential to mental, emotional and physical well-being.\nNext, let's learn more about some of the most prominent dream theories. Consistent with the psychoanalytic perspective, Sigmund Freud's theory of dreams suggests that dreams are a representation of subconscious desires, thoughts and motivations. According to Freud, people are driven by aggressive and sexual instincts that are repressed from conscious awareness. While these thoughts are not consciously expressed, they find their way into our awareness via dreams. In his famous book The Interpretation of Dreams (1899). Freud wrote that dreams are \"..... disguised fulfilments of repressed wishes.\"\nFull of thoughts, images and emotions→\n2.→\n3.→\n4.→\n5.→\n6.",

      "uddipok": "Write a summary of the following text.\nThe famous Greek philosopher Aristotle said, \"Man is by nature a social animal.\" What he meant was that man, by instinct, seeks company of others and establishes relationships, much like most animals of the wild, for companionship and for physical and emotional support. Unlike the animals however, man's relationships give meaning to his existence and inspires him to do well in education, in workplace or in a profession that he pursues.\nRelationships are of different kinds. Some are familial and intimate, formed by blood and by marriage; some are social like the ones we have with friends and some are made in school where we, form close bonds with classmates and teachers. Relationships can also be fostered in workplace, which may quickly change from professional to social. There are relationships also between human beings and animals, between children and their toys that they cannot part with.\nAll these relationships keep us close to each other and provide us all kinds of support, love and affection. A person who has no family feels the pain of loneliness and isolation. There is no one to laugh or cry with him/her. When we share our joy with someone, it simply redoubles, and when we suffer a loss and someone shares our sorrow, it lessens. Relationships are thus needed for our emotional health.\nTo build relationships, we need to have trust and respect for each other, and love where this is needed. We cannot be selfish and possessive if we want to establish an effective relationship. But quite often we see people quarrelling and fighting with each other which only brings misery and loss to all.",

          "explanation": "The passage portrays the fact that human beings naturally develop different types of relationships through trust, respect and love. Relationships are formed by blood or marriage, in educational institutions or workplaces, etc. Relationships give meaning to our existence and inspire us to perform well in every stage. Moreover, relationships fill our life with love, support, and endearment. Lonely and isolated people cannot share their joy or sorrow. Through sharing, happiness increases, and sorrows decreases. Hence, relationships are essential for mental health. However, relationships with selfishness and possessiveness are detrimental to mental health and cause sufferings."

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following text.\nMany adolescents face pressure to use alcohol, cigarettes, or other drugs and to initiate sexual relationships putting\nthemselves at high risk for intentional and unintentłonal injuries, unintended pregnancies, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Many also experience a wide range of adjustment and mental health problems. Behaviour patterns that are established during this period such as the use or avoidance of drugs and taking or abstaining from sexual risk can have long-lasting negative and positive effects on future health and well-being. As a result, adults have unique opportunities to influence adolescents. Adolescents are different both from young children and adults. Specifically, adolescents are not fully capable of understanding complex concepts, or the relationship between behaviour and consequences, or the degree of control they have or can have over health decision-making, including that related to sexual behaviour. This inability may make them particularly vulnerable to sexual exploitation and high-risk behaviours. Laws, customs, and practices may also affect adolescents differently than adults. For example, laws and policies often restrict adolescents' access to reproductive health information and services, especially when they are unmarried. In addition, even when services do exist, provider attitudes about adolescents often pose a significant barrier to the use of those services.",

          "explanation": "This passage highlights on the critical moments of adolescents, and the complexity and pressures they face during adolescence period. This phase is so critical since he/she has to face difficulties to adjust with them. They face life-destructing pressures and a wide range of mental and health problems. Also, this period is the shaper of his/her future with negative or positive effects. Adolescents are unable to perceive the complex concepts of life. Therefore, they become very vulnerable to high-risk behaviours and sexual exploitation. There are some restrictions and laws imposed on them to control or prevent them from going astray. As this phase is so critical for them, adults and other concerned authorities should be aware to guide them in the right direction."

For many different reasons, English has achieved the prestige of being that language. As a result, it has crossed national borders to reach people who speak other languages. It is no longer the unique possession of British or American people, but a language that belongs to the world's people. In fact, bilingual and multilingual users of English far outnumber its monolingual native speakers. This phenomenon has led to a bewildering variety of English around the world. As more and more people speak English, more and more varieties have emerged which are strongly influenced by the pronunciation, grammar and idioms of the respective mother tongues. World English has now moved away from the control of the native speakers. However, the question of British or American English is not so important now.
