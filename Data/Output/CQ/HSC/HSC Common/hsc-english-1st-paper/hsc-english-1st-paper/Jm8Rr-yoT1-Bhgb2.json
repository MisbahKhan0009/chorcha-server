          "explanation": "The bar graph illustrates the steady increase in the number of internet users in Bangladesh from 2014 to 2019. The graph shows that in 2014, there were around 40 million users, which increased to approximately 60 million by 2015. Then, the number of users suddenly decreased and reached 50 million in 2016. Only this particular year marks a decrease in the number of users. Then, a significant surge occurred in 2017 and the number of internet users jumped to 70 million. This marks an increase highlighting a rapid growth in internet accessibility and usage. The number of users remained same in 2018.

The more they have, the more they want. He thought, if he had the golden touch, he would be the happiest man. A wise god granted his wish promptly. That afternoon, Midas was sitting near an apple tree in the palace orchard. A ripe apple fell from the tree in his front. He picked it up. It became gold. Midas realized that he had been gifted with a golden touch. He was overwhelmed with joy. He entered the palace with an ecstasy of joy. His little daughter, Marigold came running to her father. Midas took her up in his arms with an intensity of glee. But alas! There was a statue of gold in his lap. The princess was no more that Marigold. Now, he needed Marigold and not gold. He was shedding bitter tears. Suddenly, his face beamed up. He remembered the god. He prayed prayed to t him to take away the golden touch. The wise god heard the king's prayer and lifted from him the golden touch. Midas felt profoundly grateful. He took the princess again into the lap. She became Marigold once again. Then Midas' joy knew no bounds. He grew wiser and gave up his greed.'"

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following text.\nMany adolescents face pressure to use alcohol, cigarettes, or other drugs and to initiate sexual relationships putting\nthemselves at high risk for intentional and unintentłonal injuries, unintended pregnancies, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Many also experience a wide range of adjustment and mental health problems. Behaviour patterns that are established during this period such as the use or avoidance of drugs and taking or abstaining from sexual risk can have long-lasting negative and positive effects on future health and well-being. As a result, adults have unique opportunities to influence adolescents. Adolescents are different both from young children and adults. Specifically, adolescents are not fully capable of understanding complex concepts, or the relationship between behaviour and consequences, or the degree of control they have or can have over health decision-making, including that related to sexual behaviour. This inability may make them particularly vulnerable to sexual exploitation and high-risk behaviours. Laws, customs, and practices may also affect adolescents differently than adults. For example, laws and policies often restrict adolescents' access to reproductive health information and services, especially when they are unmarried. In addition, even when services do exist, provider attitudes about adolescents often pose a significant barrier to the use of those services.",

This phase is so critical since he/she has to face difficulties to adjust with them. They face life-destructing pressures and a wide range of mental and health problems. Also, this period is the shaper of his/her future with negative or positive effects. Adolescents are unable to perceive the complex concepts of life. Therefore, they become very vulnerable to high-risk behaviours and sexual exploitation. There are some restrictions and laws imposed on them to control or prevent them from going astray. As this phase is so critical for them, adults and other concerned authorities should be aware to guide them in the right direction."

On her first mission that lasted for 15 days, 16 hours, 34 minutes and 4 seconds she travelled 6.5 million miles. She was responsible for deploying the Spartan Satellite which however malfunctioned, necessitating a spacewalk by Winston Scott and Tako Doi, two of her fellow astronauts, to retrieve the satellite. In 2000, she was selected for her second space mission STS 107. This mission was repeatedly delayed due to scheduling conflicts and technical problems. On 16 January 2003, Kalpana Chawla finally started her new mission with six other space crew on the ill-fated space shuttle Columbia. She was one of the mission specialists. Chawla's responsibilities included the microgravity experiments, for which the crew conducted nearly 80 experiments studying earth and space science, advanced technology development, and\nastronaut health and safety.",
