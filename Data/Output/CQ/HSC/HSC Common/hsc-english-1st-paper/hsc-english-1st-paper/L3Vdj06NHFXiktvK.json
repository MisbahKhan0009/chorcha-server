      "uddipok": "Write a summary of the following text.\nThe famous Greek philosopher Aristotle said, \"Man is by nature a social animal.\" What he meant was that man, by instinct, seeks company of others and establishes relationships, much like most animals of the wild, for companionship and for physical and emotional support. Unlike the animals however, man's relationships give meaning to his existence and inspires him to do well in education, in workplace or in a profession that he pursues.\nRelationships are of different kinds. Some are familial and intimate, formed by blood and by marriage; some are social like the ones we have with friends and some are made in school where we, form close bonds with classmates and teachers. Relationships can also be fostered in workplace, which may quickly change from professional to social. There are relationships also between human beings and animals, between children and their toys that they cannot part with.\nAll these relationships keep us close to each other and provide us all kinds of support, love and affection. A person who has no family feels the pain of loneliness and isolation. There is no one to laugh or cry with him/her. When we share our joy with someone, it simply redoubles, and when we suffer a loss and someone shares our sorrow, it lessens. Relationships are thus needed for our emotional health.\nTo build relationships, we need to have trust and respect for each other, and love where this is needed. We cannot be selfish and possessive if we want to establish an effective relationship. But quite often we see people quarrelling and fighting with each other which only brings misery and loss to all.",

          "explanation": "The passage portrays the fact that human beings naturally develop different types of relationships through trust, respect and love. Relationships are formed by blood or marriage, in educational institutions or workplaces, etc. Relationships give meaning to our existence and inspire us to perform well in every stage. Moreover, relationships fill our life with love, support, and endearment. Lonely and isolated people cannot share their joy or sorrow. Through sharing, happiness increases, and sorrows decreases. Hence, relationships are essential for mental health. However, relationships with selfishness and possessiveness are detrimental to mental health and cause sufferings."

Increased tourism to sensitive areas without proper planning and marfagement can actually harm the ecosystem and its species because the infrastructure needed to sustain tourism such as roads can contribute to environmental degradation.\nEcotourism is also said by critics to have a negative impact on local communities because the arrival of foreign visitors and wealth can shift political and economic conditions of the area. It can also make the area dependent more on tourism than its domestic economic practices.\nWhile ecotourism becomes popular, we must however, remain cautious about its adverse effects and do our best to protect the environment and ecosystem.\n1.

      "uddipok": "Write a summary of the following passage.\nEducation aims to bring about positive changes in our behavior. It helps us try to change our lives as well as the society we live in. Education that does not illuminate our minds or does not inspire us to work for the community is not complete at all. Education is not all about getting grades or receiving certificates- we use education to make life better. We are expected to apply the knowledge, skills and values that we learn in a classroom in our engagement with the world that lies outside. And we can do so in many different ways. Let's have a look at how education works. Learners' civic engagement is highly appreciated all over the world. Civic engagement means working to make a difference in the civic life (the public life of the citizens as constructed with private or personal life) of the community using knowledge, skills, values and motivation. Civic engagement promotes the quality of life in a community by contributing to the improvement of health and wellbeing of the people.\nCivically engaged individuals recognize themselves as members of a larger social community and are concerned about civic issues. They consider themselves responsible citizens who take action or raise their voices against injustice, discrimination and other forms of social ills.\nIn civic engagement, issues of public concern are crucial. Civic engagement includes individual or group activities to protect public interests and change the way the community values itself. For example, If you are protesting against any unjust decision of the local municipality such as raising taxes or an act that might work against people's interests, you are civically engaged and your action is considered a civic engagement. This protest can be done in different ways such as organizing rallies, collecting signatures, making human chains, writing petitions, etc. You can also help control traffic in front of a school, help children to cross the roads, work in a team to clean a park or a sea beach. You can also give some services to elderly people. These are all examples of civic engagement as what you do directly affects the community.\nWhen civic engagement is a part of an academic program, and the learners' engagement is assessed following a scale, then it is called service learning. It involves the application of knowledge and skills learned in the classroom and then making a complete plan of action 1.e. preparing a budget, starting the process of implementation, involving people and activating operational strategies.",

A civically engaged person works to create a difference in the civic life taking action or raising voice against injustice, discrimination and other forms of social ills. When we work for social welfare, we are civically engaged. Civic engagement may be individual or group activities. For example, we can raise voice against raising excessive taxes. This protest can be done by organising ralles, collecting signature, making human chains, etc. Learners engagement is evaluated by following a scale. Rnowledge and skills learned in the school is applied. in society for public welfare."

          "explanation": "The bar graph, titled \"The Average Price Per Kilometre of Clothing,\" illustrates the variation in clothing import costs into the European Union from six countries-Argentina, Brazil, Japan, China, India, and Bangladesh-over the period of 1993 to 2003. In 1993, Argentina led with the highest average price of approximately 28 pounds per kilometre, followed by Brazil at about 23 pounds. Japan recorded a price of 15 pounds, while China and India showed moderate pricing at 10 and 6 pounds, respectively. Bangladesh had the lowest cost, with only 3 pounds per kilometre. This highlights a substantial disparity in clothing prices across the countries. In 2003, significant price changes were evident, with most countries experiencing a rise in costs, except for Argentina, Brazil, and Japan. Argentina's price saw a slight reduction to around 26 pounds, and Brazil's remained unchanged. Japan's price fell to 13 pounds, aligning with China's price for that year. Conversely, India experienced a modest increase, reaching 12 pounds, and Bangladesh's price climbed slightly to about 7 pounds per kilometre. These changes reflect the economic dynamics and evolving trends in global textile production and trade during the decade."

The dog did not want to miss the opportunity, so it stole a piece of meat and ran away within a moment. Then, he was looking for a safe place to eat it. On his way, there was a small bridge over a canal. He started to cross the canal. While crossing the bridge, he saw his reflection in the static clean water of the canal. He thought that another dog with a piece of meat was walking there. He became so much curious to have the piece of meat. So, he barked at his reflection. Soon, his own piece fell into the water. To get it back, he jumped into the canal. However, he failed to regain it. After hard labour, he got on the bank of the canal and thought himself, \"Grasp all, and lose all\"."

          "explanation": "Subject: Exploring the Enchanting Landscapes of Bangladesh\nHey [Friend's Name],\nI hope this email finds you in good spirits! I've been meaning to share some of the incredible experiences I've had recently, particularly exploring the breathtaking beauty of Bangladesh. Trust me, it's been nothing short of mesmerizing!\nLet me paint you a picture of the landscapes that have left me in awe. Picture lush green fields stretching as far as the eye can see, with vibrant hues of paddy swaying gently in the breeze. The countryside here is like something out of a postcard, with quaint villages nestled amidst rolling hills and meandering rivers.\nSpeaking of rivers, you wouldn't believe the majesty of the mighty Padma, Meghna, and Jamuna rivers that crisscross the land. These waterways are not just lifelines for transportation and trade but also sources of timeless beauty. At sunset, the skies are set ablaze with hues of orange and pink, casting a magical glow over the tranquil waters below.\nBut it's not just the rural landscapes that steal the show; Bangladesh's coastal regions are a sight to behold as well. Miles of pristine sandy beaches stretch along the coastline, fringed by swaying palms and dotted with colorful fishing boats. And let me tell you about the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest. Navigating through its intricate network of waterways, surrounded by dense foliage and exotic wildlife, feels like stepping into a world untouched by time.\nOf course, no discussion of Bangladesh's beauty would be complete without mentioning its vibrant cities. Dhaka, the bustling capital, is a whirlwind of sights and sounds, where ancient mosques and modern skyscrapers coexist harmoniously. The streets are alive with the hustle and bustle of daily life, and the air is infused with the aroma of delicious street food.\nI could go on and on about the wonders of Bangladesh, but I'll leave it at that for now. Suffice it to say, this country has stolen a piece of my heart with its unparalleled beauty and warm hospitality. I can't wait for you to experience it for yourself someday.\nUntil then, take care, and keep dreaming of distant shores!\nWarm regards,\nRafa\n[Stamped with a picturesque image of Bangladesh's landscapes]"
