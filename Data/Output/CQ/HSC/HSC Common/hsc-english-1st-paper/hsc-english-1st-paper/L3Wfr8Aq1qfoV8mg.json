A famous astrologer happened to stop at his capital on his way to Benares. Hearing about him, the king wanted to meet him in the palace. The astrologer told the king something very unpleasant. At this, the king got furious and condemned him to death. The astrologer was taken to the place of execution. The king then asked, \"How long would you live?\" The astrologer thought that the king would prove him a liar putting him to death. He then thought for a while for some way to escape. With ready wit, he said, \"The stars declare that I'll die only a week before your majesty! I shall wait to receive you where you have been sending me.\" At this, the king turned pale. \"Drive this wretch away and let him not come again,\" shouted the king.\n"

I understand that you're feeling apprehensive about English, but I'm here to assure you that with a bit of effort and the right approach, you can become competent in English.\nFirstly, it's essential to change your mindset about learning English. Instead of seeing it as a daunting task, try to view it as a fun and exciting journey. Remember, everyone starts somewhere, and making mistakes is a natural part of the learning process.\nTo improve your English skills, here are some practical steps you can take:\n1. Start Small : Begin by learning basic vocabulary and common phrases. You can use flashcards, language learning apps, or online resources to help you memorize words.\n2. Practice Regularly : Consistency is key. Try to dedicate a little time each day to practice reading, writing, listening, and speaking in English. You can read English books or articles, listen to podcasts or songs, and even engage in conversations with English speakers if possible.\n3. Set Realistic Goals : Set achievable goals for yourself, such as learning a certain number of new words each week or improving your pronunciation. Celebrate your progress along the way to stay motivated.\n4. Immerse Yourself : Surround yourself with English as much as possible. Watch English movies or TV shows, listen to English radio stations, and try to think in English. Immersion can significantly accelerate your learning process.\n5. Don't Be Afraid to Make Mistakes : Remember that making mistakes is part of learning any new language. Don't let fear hold you back from practicing or speaking English. Embrace your errors as opportunities to improve.\n6. Seek Feedback : If you have the opportunity, ask for feedback from English speakers or teachers. Constructive criticism can help you identify areas for improvement and refine your skills.\n7. Stay Motivated : Find reasons to stay motivated, whether it's to advance your career, communicate with people from different cultures, or simply challenge yourself. Remind yourself of your goals and the benefits of learning English.\nAbir, I believe in you. Learning English may seem daunting at first, but with perseverance and dedication, you'll undoubtedly become more competent in the language. Feel free to reach out to me if you need any support or encouragement along the way.\nBest wishes,\nMahin"

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following text.\nValentina Tereshkova was born in a village, in Central Russia on 6 March 1937. Her father was a tractor driver and her mother worked in a textile plant. At the age of eight she began her schooling but did not enjoy it much. She left the school within a few years. Afterwards she completed her education through distance learning. She became interested in parachuting from a young age, and trained in skydiving at the local Aeroclub, making her first jump at age 22 on 21 May 1959. It was her expertise in skydiving that led to her selection as a cosmonaut.After the flight of Yuri Gagarin, the first human being to travel to outer space in April 1961, the Soviet Union decided to send a woman in space. On 16 February 1962, \"proletaria\" Valentina Tereshkova was selected for this project from among more than four hundred applicants. Tereshkova had to undergo a series of training that included weightless flights, isolation tests, centrifuge tests, rocket theory, spacecraft engineering, 120 parachute jumps and pilot training in MiG-15UTI jet fighters. Since the successful launch of the spacecraft Vostok-5 on 14 June 1963, Tereshkova began preparing for her own flight. On the morning of 16 June 1963, Tereshkova and her. back-up cosmonaut Solovyova were dressed in space-suits and taken to the space shuttle launch pad by a bus. After completing her communication and life support checks, she was sealed inside Vostok-6. Finishing a two-\nhour countdown, Vostok-6 launched faultlessly. Although Tereshkova experienced nausea and physical discomfort for much of the flight, she orbited the earth 48 times and spent almost three days in space. With a single flight, she logged more flight time than the combined times of all American astronauts who had flown before that date. Tereshkova also maintained a flight log and took photographs of the horizon, which were later used to identify aerosol layers within the atmosphere. Vostok-6 was the final Vostok flight and was launched two days after Vostok-5, which carried Valary Bykovsky into a similar orbit for five days, landing three hours after Tereshkova. The two vessels approached each other within 5 kilometers at one point, and from space Tereshkova communicated with Bykovsky and the Soviet leader Khrushchev by radio.",

(No. 1 has been done for you)\nHe came every day and cut my wood and did small helpful favors and stayed to talk. The days had become cold, and often I let him come inside the cabin. He would lie on the floor in front of the fire, with one arm across the pointer, and they would both doze and wait quietly for me. Other days they ran with a common ecstasy through the laurel, and he brought me back vermilion maple leaves, and chestnut boughs dripping with imperial yellow. I was ready to go.\nI said to him, \"You have been my friend, Jerry. I shall often think of you and miss you. Pat will miss you too. I am leaving tomorrow.\"\nHe did not answer... and I watched him go in silence up the hill. I expected him the next day, but he did not come... I closed the cabin and started the car...

The Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. The Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. So, we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.... I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal. I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of 'interposition' and 'nullification', that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.\"",

Here the speaker says that Black people are still not free because of unfair treatment. They live in poverty while others are rich. The Black feel like strangers in their own country. Even with these struggles, the speaker has a dream. He dreams that one day, everyone will be treated as equals. He hopes that former slaves' children and former slave owners' children will live peacefully together. He dreams that every state will become fair and that  his children will be judged by their character, not by their skin color.
