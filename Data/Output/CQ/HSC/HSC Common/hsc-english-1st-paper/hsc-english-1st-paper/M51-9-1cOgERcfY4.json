          "explanation": "\n(a)\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines adolescence as the period of life between 10 and 19 years of age. This stage marks the transition from childhood to adulthood, characterized by significant physical, emotional, and social development. Adolescents experience rapid growth and undergo various changes that influence their health, behavior, and interactions with society.\n(b)\nAccording to the 2022 Bangladesh Census, the population of adolescents aged 10–14 is approximately 16.6 million, with 8.5 million boys and 7.8 million girls. For the 15–19 age group, there are about 16.5 million adolescents, comprising 8.1 million boys and 8.5 million girls. In total, adolescents make up about 28.8% of Bangladesh's population, with a near-equal distribution between boys and girls.\n(c)\nAdolescent girls in Bangladesh face several challenges\nChild Marriage : Approximately 51% of girls in Bangladesh are married before the age of 18, making it one of the highest rates globally.\nEducation : While enrollment rates for girls have improved, many still face barriers to completing secondary education, especially in rural areas.\nHealth Risks : Early pregnancies pose significant health risks, with many adolescent girls becoming mothers before reaching adulthood.\nViolence and Abuse : A significant number of adolescent girls experience physical or sexual violence, often within intimate relationships.\nThese issues hinder their development and access to opportunities, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.\n(d)\nIn Bangladesh, the legal age for marriage is 18 for girls and 21 for boys, as stipulated by the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 2017. However, the law includes provisions that allow for exceptions under certain circumstances, such as parental consent and court approval, which have been criticized for potentially undermining efforts to prevent child marriage.\n(e)\nWhile the legal age for marriage is 21 for boys in Bangladesh, readiness for marriage is influenced by various factors beyond age, including emotional maturity, financial stability, and societal expectations. Cultural norms often dictate that men should be established in their careers and capable of supporting a family before marriage. However, these expectations can vary widely across different communities and regions within the country."

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following text.\n\"The Negro is still not free. The life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. The Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. The Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. So, we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.... I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal. I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of 'interposition' and 'nullification', that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.\"",

Here the speaker says that Black people are still not free because of unfair treatment. They live in poverty while others are rich. The Black feel like strangers in their own country. Even with these struggles, the speaker has a dream. He dreams that one day, everyone will be treated as equals. He hopes that former slaves' children and former slave owners' children will live peacefully together. He dreams that every state will become fair and that  his children will be judged by their character, not by their skin color. He also hopes that black and white  children in Alabama will become friends."

          "explanation": "The pie chart illustrates the preferred beverages of 400 people surveyed during the summer. A striking majority, 56%, prefer traditional hot tea, making it by far the most popular choice. Following tea, coffee holds a significant portion of preferences at 24%. These two hot beverages together account for 80% of the total, which indicates a strong inclination towards warm drinks even in the summer. Cold-coffee also holds a noticeable share of 12%, which suggests that a considerable segment of the population enjoys chilled coffee options. The remaining categories, iced-tea and cold-drinks, represent smaller segments of the surveyed population. Iced-tea is preferred by 6%, while cold-drinks are the least popular, with only 2% choosing them. This data highlights a clear preference for hot beverages, particularly tea, over cold alternatives during the summer. While\ncold-coffee gets a moderate portion, the overall trend leans heavily towards traditional hot drinks."

          "explanation": "The Proud Frog and the Pond\nOnce upon a time, there was a pond full of frogs. As it was during the rainy season, it was filled to the brim with water. Many frogs took shelter in the pond, jumping, playing, and croaking all day long. The pond was lively and cheerful.\nAmong them was a proud frog who believed he was the biggest and strongest of all. He would often boast about his strength and size to the other frogs, claiming that he could defeat any creature that came near the pond.\nOne day, a group of travelers passed by the pond with a large ox. The frogs curiously peeked from the water to see the huge animal. The proud frog, seeing the ox, felt his pride hurt. “That creature may be big,” he said loudly, “but I can be just as big if I want to!”\nHe began puffing himself up. “Look! Am I as big as that ox now?” he asked the other frogs.\n“No, not yet,” replied the frogs.\nThe proud frog puffed himself up even more. “Now?”\n“Still not as big,” they said.\nAngry and determined, the proud frog puffed and puffed, trying to become as large as the ox. But in his foolish attempt, he puffed so much that his body couldn’t handle it. With a loud pop! , he burst and died on the spot.\nAll the other frogs were shocked and saddened. They had tried to warn him, but his pride had made him blind to reason.\nMoral: Pride and envy can lead to one's downfall. Be content with who you are and never try to be someone you're not.\n"
