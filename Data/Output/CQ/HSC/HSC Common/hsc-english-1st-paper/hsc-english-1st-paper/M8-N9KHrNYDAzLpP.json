          "question": "",
          "explanation": "\n(a)\nSigmund Freud's theory, presented in The Interpretation of Dreams (1900), posits that dreams are manifestations of unconscious desires and thoughts. According to Freud, the mind protects the conscious self from disturbing thoughts by repressing them into the unconscious. Dreams serve as a \"royal road\" to understanding these repressed desires. He distinguished between the manifest content (the actual storyline of the dream) and the latent content (the hidden psychological meaning). Through mechanisms like displacement, condensation, and symbolism, the unconscious mind expresses these repressed wishes in a disguised form during sleep.\n(b)\nWhile science has made significant strides in understanding the physiological aspects of sleep and dreaming, a comprehensive explanation of why we dream remains elusive. Research indicates that dreams occur during REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, a phase characterized by heightened brain activity. However, the exact purpose of dreaming is still a subject of debate among scientists. Theories suggest that dreams may play roles in memory consolidation, emotional regulation, and problem-solving. Despite these insights, the full understanding of dreams' functions and meanings continues to be explored.\n(c)\nDreams offer several psychological and emotional benefits:\nEmotional Processing: Dreams help in processing emotions and stressors from daily life, providing a safe space to confront and understand them.\nMemory Consolidation: They play a role in organizing and storing memories, aiding in learning and information retention. (Psychology Today)\nProblem-Solving: Dreams can facilitate creative thinking and offer solutions to unresolved issues by presenting them in novel ways.\nEmotional Regulation: They assist in reducing the emotional impact of distressing memories, contributing to emotional well-being. (The Guardian)\n(d)\nThis phrase, central to Freud's dream theory, refers to the idea that dreams are the unconscious mind's way of fulfilling repressed desires in a disguised manner. Since certain wishes are unacceptable to the conscious self, the unconscious mind transforms them into symbolic representations during dreams. This \"disguise\" allows the individual to experience these desires without direct confrontation, thereby maintaining psychological defense mechanisms.\n(e)\nA dream is a sequence of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations that usually occur involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep. Dreams can happen during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, a stage where brain activity is high and resembles that of being awake. While the content and purpose of dreams are not fully understood, they have been seen as a connection to unconscious thoughts and desires. Dreams can also play a role in processing emotions and memories.\n"

Civic engagement includes individual or group activities to protect public interests and change the way the community values itself. For example, if you are protesting against any unjust decision of the local municipality such as raising taxes or an act that might work against people’s interest, you are civically engaged and your action is considered a civic engagement. This protest can be done in different ways such as organizing rallies, collecting signatures, making human chains, writing petitions, etc. You can also help control traffic in front of a school, help children to cross the roads, work in a team to clean a park or a sea beach. You can also give some services to elderly people. These are all examples of civic engagement as what you do directly affects the community.\n1.

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following text:\nIn a traditional society like ours, little boys and girls are given separate sets of toys. While toys for boys include cars, guns or footballs, girls have to be satisfied with dolls often Barbie dolls and doll-houses or miniature cooking utensils The underlying assumption is that boys are active and full of vigour, but girls are naive and lack the intelligence or energy to match their male counterparts. (This false assumption has been shattered plenty of times in the recent decades as girls began to show their power and women began competing with men in almost all areas of life It has been conclusively proved wrong most recently by the girls of Kalsindur, a village in a remote area in Dhobaura Upazila in Mymensing district. The villagers are mostly low-income but hardworking people. Even a few years ago, there was no electricity in the village. But some girls have illuminated the village both literally and metaphorically with their belief in themselves and their skill in the game of football. (The village has emerged now as a footballer factory and a symbol of girl power. And in recognition of their success, the village was provided electricity by the government)",

However, this assumption has been proven wrong, especially by the girls of Kalsindur village in Bangladesh. Despite being from a low-income, remote area without electricity until recently, these girls excelled in football, showcasing their strength and talent. Their success not only challenged gender stereotypes but also brought recognition and development to their village, which is now known as a symbol of girl power and even received electricity from the government as a result."

Leisurely activities like recreation take up 12 %, offering balance and downtime, while play accounts for a smaller 5 %, portraying more spontaneous or fun engagement. Finally, a modest 8 % is categorized under other —likely including tasks such as meals, personal care, commuting, or light chores. Overall, this distribution reflects a well-rounded daily schedule where academic responsibilities and rest dominate, yet there remains space for recreation, play, and miscellaneous activities that contribute to a holistic routine."

Tiger!” Hearing his cry, the villagers would rush with sticks and weapons to save him. But when they arrived, they found no tiger—only the cowboy laughing at them. He repeated this trick several times, and each time, the villagers felt angry and embarrassed.\nOne day, a real tiger came out of the forest and attacked his cows. The cowboy shouted loudly, “Tiger! Tiger! Help me!” But this time, the villagers thought he was joking again, so no one came to help.\nThe tiger attacked his herd, and the cowboy barely escaped with his life. He realized his mistake and felt deeply sorry. From then on, he never lied or played such tricks again, learning that trust once broken is hard to regain."
