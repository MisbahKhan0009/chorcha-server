          "explanation": "\n(a)\nPeople spend money for various reasons, including fulfilling basic needs (such as food, shelter, and clothing), pursuing desires (like entertainment, travel, and luxury items), and expressing identity or status. Spending can also be influenced by social pressures, marketing, and emotional factors. For instance, individuals may purchase items to fit in with peers or to boost self-esteem. Additionally, spending money can provide immediate gratification, which might be appealing in the short term.\n(b)\nSpending can lead to happiness when it enhances well-being, such as purchasing experiences that create lasting memories or acquiring items that improve quality of life. However, it can also result in unhappiness if it leads to financial strain, guilt, or regret. For example, overspending on credit cards can cause anxiety and stress, especially if it leads to debt. Additionally, materialism—the tendency to value possessions over relationships or personal growth—has been associated with lower life satisfaction and increased psychological issues like depression.\n(c)\nMental health issues can significantly contribute to overspending behaviors. Conditions such as anxiety, depression, and bipolar disorder may lead individuals to engage in compulsive buying as a form of coping or emotional regulation. For instance, during manic episodes, individuals with bipolar disorder might experience impulsive spending sprees, followed by feelings of guilt and financial distress. Similarly, individuals with low self-esteem may overspend to gain social approval or to feel better about themselves. These patterns can create a cycle of financial instability and emotional turmoil.\n(d)\nSalespersons often use flattery as a strategy to encourage purchases. By complimenting customers, such as saying, \"This is a perfect match for you,\" they aim to make customers feel good about themselves and more likely to buy. This technique exploits the psychological principle of reciprocity, where individuals feel compelled to return a favor or kindness. However, it's important to recognize that such praise is a common sales tactic and may not always reflect genuine opinions.\n(e)\nThe passage highlights the complex relationship between spending, happiness, and mental health. It underscores the importance of mindful spending and being aware of underlying emotional or psychological factors that influence financial decisions. The message encourages individuals to reflect on their spending habits, recognize the impact of mental health on financial behavior, and seek balance to achieve both financial stability and emotional well-being.\n"

The roughly flat island is only about 3-6 metres above the sea level. The entire island can be walked about in 3 hours. The island is known for its unique natural beauty with white sandy beaches fringed with coconut palms and a diverse marine life. Due to the expansion of unregulated tourism, the island is facing increasing erosion, contamination of surface and ground water, wildlife displacement, and loss of biodiversity. Other threats include cutting of sand dune vegetation for fuel-wood and hotel establishment; degradation of sand dune habitat; the harvesting of turtle eggs, indiscriminate exploitation of coral resources etc. To address this, the Government has declared some areas of the island as Ecologically Critical Area (ECA), prohibiting unauthorized constructions there.",

          "explanation": "\nOnce there was an illiterate but efficient boatman. He used to earn his livelihood by ferrying passengers from one bank to the other of a mighty river. One day a great professor hired his boat…\nThe professor, with a lofty smile, settled into the boat and began to boast of his vast knowledge. “Tell me, my friend,” he asked condescendingly, “have you studied philosophy?” The boatman shook his head. The professor sighed dramatically. “Then a quarter of your life is wasted.”\nUndeterred, the professor continued, “And astronomy—do you know about the planets and stars?” Again, the boatman replied with a gentle, “No.” The professor frowned. “Half of your life is lost!” he declared, letting his arrogance ripple across the water.\nThe boatman said nothing, focusing on the rhythm of his oar against the current, his eyes occasionally scanning the sky.\n“Do you at least read or write in your native tongue?” the professor pressed. “No, sir,” came the humble reply. “Three-quarters of your life wasted,” the professor concluded, with a smug nod.\nAt that moment, ominous clouds swallowed the sky. Thunder rumbled, and the wind howled through swaying trees. The river’s gentle surface turned turbulent. The small boat rocked perilously as waves surged around them.\nThe boatman remained unnerved, calmly handing the professor an oar to steady himself. Catching his breath, the boatman asked, “Sir, tell me—do you know how to swim?”\nThe professor’s confident façade crumbled in an instant. “No…” he stammered, eyes wide with fear.\nWith a compassionate yet firm voice, the boatman replied, “Then, sir, I fear your entire life has been wasted.” He rowed swiftly and steadily, maneuvering the trembling boat toward the shore.\nAs fate would have it, the wooden vessel cracked against a hidden rock and water rushed in. Panic surged in the professor’s heart. The boatman grabbed him by the collar and pulled him toward land, breaking through the torrent with the strength of experience and instinct.\nThey collapsed breathlessly on the riverbank. The storm subsided, revealing a calm sky and the professor, shivering and humbled, clutched the boatman’s hand. Embarrassment flushed his cheeks as he whispered, “I… I thought knowledge was everything. Today, I’ve learned how little that meant when I could barely keep us afloat.”\nThe boatman offered a gentle smile. “Sir, what good is knowing the stars or ancient texts if you cannot stay alive to use that knowledge? Every kind of learning is valuable—whether learned from books or life.”\nTouched by the wisdom of the simple boatman, the professor asked softly, “Would you teach me how to swim?”\n“And you… teach me to read?” the boatman responded, hope dawning in his eyes.\nAnd so, on that riverbank, two very different men began a journey of mutual learning—one teaching reading and writing, the other teaching the art of surviving life’s storms.\n"

I know social media can be fun and even useful sometimes, but spending too much time on it can really hurt your focus.\nRemember, varsity admission —especially in competitive sectors—requires strong preparation and discipline. Every hour you scroll endlessly could be an hour spent improving your concepts, solving problems, or even just getting some rest for better focus the next day.\nYou don’t need to quit social media entirely. Just limit your time —maybe check it during a short break or at the end of your study sessions. Use tools like app timers or set goals like \"no social media until after I finish my revision.\"\nStay focused on your dreams—because in the end, likes and comments won’t get you into your dream university, but your hard work will.\nTake care and stay consistent.\nYour brother,\nNabil"
