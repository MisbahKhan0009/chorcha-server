Education that does not illuminate our minds or does not inspire us to work for the community is not complete at all. Education is not all about getting grades or receiving certificates- we use education to make life better. We are expected to apply the knowledge, skills and values that we learn in a classroom in our engagement with the world that lies outside. And we can do so in many different ways. Let's have a look at how education works. Learners' civic engagement is highly appreciated all over the world. Civic engagement means working to make a difference in the civic life (the public life of the citizens as constructed with private or personal life) of the community using knowledge, skills, values and motivation. Civic engagement promotes the quality of life in a community by contributing to the improvement of health and wellbeing of the people.\nCivically engaged individuals recognize themselves as members of a larger social community and are concerned about civic issues. They consider themselves responsible citizens who take action or raise their voices against injustice, discrimination and other forms of social ills.\nIn civic engagement, issues of public concern are crucial. Civic engagement includes individual or group activities to protect public interests and change the way the community values itself. For example, If you are protesting against any unjust decision of the local municipality such as raising taxes or an act that might work against people's interests, you are civically engaged and your action is considered a civic engagement. This protest can be done in different ways such as organizing rallies, collecting signatures, making human chains, writing petitions, etc. You can also help control traffic in front of a school, help children to cross the roads, work in a team to clean a park or a sea beach. You can also give some services to elderly people. These are all examples of civic engagement as what you do directly affects the community.\nWhen civic engagement is a part of an academic program, and the learners' engagement is assessed following a scale, then it is called service learning. It involves the application of knowledge and skills learned in the classroom and then making a complete plan of action 1.e. preparing a budget, starting the process of implementation, involving people and activating operational strategies.",

          "explanation": "Education plays a vital role in bringing about positive changes in behaviour. It helps us try to change our life as well as our society. Complete education not only illuminates our minds but also inspires us to work for the community. The purpose of education is not getting grades and receiving certificates. The main objective of education is to make life better. Civic engagement of the learners is highly appreciated all over the world nowadays. A civically engaged person works to create a difference in the civic life taking action or raising voice against injustice, discrimination and other forms of social ills. When we work for social welfare, we are civically engaged. Civic engagement may be individual or group activities. For example, we can raise voice against raising excessive taxes. This protest can be done by organising ralles, collecting signature, making human chains, etc. Learners engagement is evaluated by following a scale. Rnowledge and skills learned in the school is applied. in society for public welfare."

      "uddipok": "Read the following text and make a flow chart showing the features of dream. (One is done for you.)\nDreams have fascinated philosophers for thousands of years, but only recently have dreams been subjected to empirical research and scientific study. Chances are that you've often found yourself puzzling over the content of a dream, or perhaps you've' wondered why you dream at all. First, let's start by answering a basic question: What is a dream? A dream can include any of the images, thoughts and emotions that are experienced during sleep. Dreams. can be extraordinarily vivid or very vague; filled with joyful emotions or frightening images, focused and understandable or unclear and confusing.\nWhy do we dream? What purpose do dreams serve? While many theories have been proposed no consensus has emerged. Considering the time. we spend in a dreaming state, the fact that researchers do not yet understand the purpose of dreams may seem baffling. However, it is important to consider that science is still unraveling the exact purpose and function of sleep itself: Some researchers suggest that dreams serve no real purpose, while others believe that dreaming is essential to mental, emotional and physical well-being.\nNext, let's learn more about some of the most prominent dream theories. Consistent with the psychoanalytic perspective, Sigmund Freud's theory of dreams suggests that dreams are a representation of subconscious desires, thoughts and motivations. According to Freud, people are driven by aggressive and sexual instincts that are repressed from conscious awareness. While these thoughts are not consciously expressed, they find their way into our awareness via dreams. In his famous book The Interpretation of Dreams (1899). Freud wrote that dreams are \"..... disguised fulfilments of repressed wishes.\"\nFull of thoughts, images and emotions→\n2.→\n3.→\n4.→\n5.→\n6.",

She told me to go away Now she is married to another man. My father lives very far away. I want to go to him, but he won't take me either. I begged him to send me some money so that I could buy a bus ticket. I am still waiting. He has not answered: The streets are now my home. Sometimes I find work. I used to collect trash and sell it to a vendor. I stopped doing that after I had a serious infection and a doctor told me to stay away from the trash dump. Once I worked for an ice-cream shop owner and sold ice-cream on the beach. But I got no money in return. The owner of the shop gave me something to eat, and let me sleep in his hut at night. The work was difficult and painful. The ice-cream box is quite heavy when it is full. I had to walk for hours, offering my ice-cream to whoever wanted to buy.. There were days when I could not even sell one ice-cream. In a way, I am lucky because I am alive. My friends who work sorting rubbish in dumps often suffer from serious diseases. One of them was recently killed after he fell into a hole that opened up in the pile of trash. Many of us work for 10 to 12 hours, and get so little in return that we can't even buy food.",

His mother sent him away, and his father, who lives far away, has not responded to his pleas for help. Amerigo survives by finding occasional work, such as collecting and selling trash, despite the health risks involved. He once worked for an ice-cream shop but received no money, only food and a place to sleep. Despite the hardships, Amerigo considers himself fortunate to be alive, unlike some of his friends who have suffered serious illnesses or even death from their work in trash dumps. Many like him work long hours for minimal pay, struggling to afford basic necessities like food."
