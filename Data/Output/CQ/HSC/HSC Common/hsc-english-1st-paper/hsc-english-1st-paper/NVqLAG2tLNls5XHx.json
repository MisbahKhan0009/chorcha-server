      "uddipok": "Write a summary of the following text.\nThe famous Greek philosopher Aristotle said, \"Man is by nature a social animal.\" What he meant was that man, by instinct, seeks company of others and establishes relationships, much like most animals of the wild, for companionship and for physical and emotional support. Unlike the animals however, man's relationships give meaning to his existence and inspires him to do well in education, in workplace or in a profession that he pursues.\nRelationships are of different kinds. Some are familial and intimate, formed by blood and by marriage; some are social like the ones we have with friends and some are made in school where we, form close bonds with classmates and teachers. Relationships can also be fostered in workplace, which may quickly change from professional to social. There are relationships also between human beings and animals, between children and their toys that they cannot part with.\nAll these relationships keep us close to each other and provide us all kinds of support, love and affection. A person who has no family feels the pain of loneliness and isolation. There is no one to laugh or cry with him/her. When we share our joy with someone, it simply redoubles, and when we suffer a loss and someone shares our sorrow, it lessens. Relationships are thus needed for our emotional health.\nTo build relationships, we need to have trust and respect for each other, and love where this is needed. We cannot be selfish and possessive if we want to establish an effective relationship. But quite often we see people quarrelling and fighting with each other which only brings misery and loss to all.",

          "explanation": "The passage portrays the fact that human beings naturally develop different types of relationships through trust, respect and love. Relationships are formed by blood or marriage, in educational institutions or workplaces, etc. Relationships give meaning to our existence and inspire us to perform well in every stage. Moreover, relationships fill our life with love, support, and endearment. Lonely and isolated people cannot share their joy or sorrow. Through sharing, happiness increases, and sorrows decreases. Hence, relationships are essential for mental health. However, relationships with selfishness and possessiveness are detrimental to mental health and cause sufferings."

      "uddipok": "Write a summary of the following passage.\nEducation aims to bring about positive changes in our behavior. It helps us try to change our lives as well as the society we live in. Education that does not illuminate our minds or does not inspire us to work for the community is not complete at all. Education is not all about getting grades or receiving certificates- we use education to make life better. We are expected to apply the knowledge, skills and values that we learn in a classroom in our engagement with the world that lies outside. And we can do so in many different ways. Let's have a look at how education works. Learners' civic engagement is highly appreciated all over the world. Civic engagement means working to make a difference in the civic life (the public life of the citizens as constructed with private or personal life) of the community using knowledge, skills, values and motivation. Civic engagement promotes the quality of life in a community by contributing to the improvement of health and wellbeing of the people.\nCivically engaged individuals recognize themselves as members of a larger social community and are concerned about civic issues. They consider themselves responsible citizens who take action or raise their voices against injustice, discrimination and other forms of social ills.\nIn civic engagement, issues of public concern are crucial. Civic engagement includes individual or group activities to protect public interests and change the way the community values itself. For example, If you are protesting against any unjust decision of the local municipality such as raising taxes or an act that might work against people's interests, you are civically engaged and your action is considered a civic engagement. This protest can be done in different ways such as organizing rallies, collecting signatures, making human chains, writing petitions, etc. You can also help control traffic in front of a school, help children to cross the roads, work in a team to clean a park or a sea beach. You can also give some services to elderly people. These are all examples of civic engagement as what you do directly affects the community.\nWhen civic engagement is a part of an academic program, and the learners' engagement is assessed following a scale, then it is called service learning. It involves the application of knowledge and skills learned in the classroom and then making a complete plan of action 1.e. preparing a budget, starting the process of implementation, involving people and activating operational strategies.",

A civically engaged person works to create a difference in the civic life taking action or raising voice against injustice, discrimination and other forms of social ills. When we work for social welfare, we are civically engaged. Civic engagement may be individual or group activities. For example, we can raise voice against raising excessive taxes. This protest can be done by organising ralles, collecting signature, making human chains, etc. Learners engagement is evaluated by following a scale.

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following passage:\nA plate of hot French fries and a huge burger with hot cheese oozing out of it, with a carbonated drink: looks like a treat! This calorie-rich junk food does look mouthwatering but is known to be nutritionally poor. Junk food or fast food has become an increasingly popular food choice. Ideally, junk foods are defined as processed foods with negligible nutrient value and are often high in salt, sugar and fat. But we often confuse fast foods with junk foods. How are they different? Or what is junk food really? Junk foods are processed foods consisting of high calories, but that is considered only as a broad umbrella. These foods are prepared in a way that they look appealing and are enjoyable so you are chemically programmed to ask for more. According to Dr. Sunali Sharma, a Dietician & Nutritionist, \"Commercial products including salted snack foods, chewing gum, candy, sugary desserts, fried fast food, and sweetened carbonated beverages that have little or no nutritional value but are high in calories, salt, and fats may be considered junk foods. Though not all fast foods are junk foods, a great number of them are. For instance, a salad may be fast food but is definitely not junk food. Some foods like burgers, pizzas, and tacos may alternate between junk and healthy categories depending on the ingredients, calories and process of manufacturing.\" Frequent consumption of junk food increases the intake of excess fat, simple carbohydrates, and processed sugar which may lead to a higher risk of obesity and cardiovascular diseases, among other chronic health problems. The resulting obesity may begin clogging up the arteries and lay the basis of an impending heart attack. It has also been suggested that eating junk food affects the brain in the same way as consuming addictive drugs. An addiction to junk food may even result in the rejection of healthier food options like fruits, vegetables, salads etc. leading to further lack of nourishment.",

It clarifies the difference between junk food and fast food, stating that while not all fast food is junk food, many fast food items may fall into that category. The passage highlights the negative health effects of frequent junk food consumption, such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and addiction-like responses in the brain. It also mentions how a reliance on junk food can lead to a rejection of healthier food options, resulting in inadequate nourishment."

He applied for various posts, but he did not get any.\nBeing frustrated, he returned to his small village, nestled amidst the lush greenery of rural Bangladesh. As he walked through the familiar streets, his heart heavy with disappointment, Fardin couldn't shake the feeling of disillusionment that hung over him like a dark cloud.\nBut amidst his despair, Fardin's gaze was drawn to the horizon—a vast expanse of open sky that stretched out before him, seemingly endless and full of promise. Inspired by the sight, a flicker of hope ignited within him, urging him to seek out new opportunities beyond the confines of his village.\nDetermined to carve out his own path, Fardin decided to explore alternative avenues for employment. Drawing on his passion for education and his desire to make a difference, he volunteered to teach at the local school, offering his knowledge and expertise to the eager young minds of his community.\nDespite the meager pay and long hours, Fardin found fulfillment in his work, knowing that he was making a meaningful impact on the lives of his students. He poured his heart and soul into teaching, instilling in his pupils a love for learning and a belief in their own potential.\nAs time passed, word of Fardin's dedication and passion spread throughout the village, earning him the respect and admiration of his peers. Inspired by his example, other educated youth followed suit, volunteering their time and skills to uplift their community.\nAnd so, amidst the tranquil beauty of rural Bangladesh, Fardin found a sense of purpose and fulfillment that transcended the boundaries of conventional success. Though he may not have found the job he initially sought in the bustling city of Dhaka, he discovered something far more valuable—a calling to serve others and make a difference in the world.\nAs he stood beneath the open sky, gazing out at the horizon that had once seemed so daunting, Fardin realized that the greatest opportunities often lie not in distant cities or far-off lands, but right here at home, amidst the familiar faces and cherished memories of his beloved village. And with renewed determination and a heart full of gratitude, he embraced the journey that lay ahead, knowing that his greatest adventure had only just begun."

As your elder sibling, I want to take a moment to share some advice with you, especially as you navigate through your studies and academic pursuits.\nFirst and foremost, I want to emphasize the importance of consistency and diligence in your studies. As you progress through your classes, the workload may increase, and the topics may become more challenging. However, by staying organized and dedicating a little time each day to review your lessons and complete your assignments, you'll find that the learning process becomes much more manageable.\nI understand that it can be tempting to procrastinate or put off studying until the last minute, especially when there are so many other distractions vying for your attention. But trust me when I say that regular study habits pay off in the long run. By staying on top of your coursework and revising regularly, you'll not only retain information more effectively but also feel more confident and prepared come exam time.\nOn that note, I want to stress the importance of academic integrity and ethical conduct in all your endeavors. It can be tempting to resort to unfair means or shortcuts, especially when the pressure is on during exams. However, I urge you to resist that temptation and always strive to achieve success through honest and hard work.\nCheating or adopting unfair means may provide temporary relief or a fleeting sense of accomplishment, but it ultimately undermines your own integrity and self-respect. Remember, true success is not measured by the grades you receive, but by the knowledge and skills you acquire along the way, as well as the values you uphold in pursuit of your goals.\nSo, my dear brother, as you continue your academic journey, I encourage you to stay true to yourself and your principles. Study diligently, stay organized, and approach each challenge with determination and integrity. Remember that I am always here to support and guide you, every step of the way.\nWishing you all the best in your studies and beyond. I have full confidence in your abilities, and I know that you have what it takes to excel and achieve your dreams.\nWith love and encouragement,\n[Your Name]\n\n[Stamp Here…]"
