The same can be said about a motorcycle rider, with some modifications. These are all very visible. But, behind all, there is something that keeps working unseen. And that is the Central Processing Unit (CPU), your brain. CPUS are artificially intelligent machines that are programmed to do specific jobs under fixed conditions and judgements. But the human brain is intelligent by nature. It is the most sophisticated machine that is able to operate on ever-changing conditions and standards of judgement. As conditions in the traffic keep invariably changing, this virtue of sophistication of your brain must be at work when you are driving. The difference between traffic in the roads and highways and racing circuit must not be blurring inside you. Never imagine yourself to be a Michael Schumacher driving an F − 1 \\mathrm{F}-1 F − 1 at 300 m p h 300 \\mathrm{mph} 300 mph . Leave no room for fantasy. You must always be ready to encounter unexpected behavior from any vehicle or pedestrian. 'Keep your cool' is easy to advice but difficult to maintain. Still you must always restrain yourself because, at the end of the day, you don't want to be regarded as a killer. Now you see, the last thing that differentiates you from a computer is your conscience.",

          "explanation": "Summary\nThere are some works like driving a car or a motorcycle, which are visible. But there is something that keeps working unseen and that is the Central Processing Unit (CPU), our brain. Our brain, which is intelligent by nature, works behind the screen while CPUs are artificially intelligent. It is the most sophisticated machine operating on ever-changing conditions and standards, of judgement. Conditions in the traffic keep invariably changing and our brain must work at the time of our driving. We should be realistic and as such should not rely on imagination. And we should always remain careful about unexpected behaviour from others on the road. Still we must restrain ourselves as we do not want to be regarded as a killer. Here is the difference between a computer and us. And our conscience makes the difference."

(One is done for you):\nConflict can be described as a disagreement among groups or individuals characterized by antagonism and hostility. This is usually fuelled by the opposition of one party to another in an attempt to reach an objective different from that of the other party.\nThe elements involved in the conflict have varied sets of principles and values, thus allowing a conflict to arise. Conflict can be defined in many ways but one of the simplest is that it pertains to the opposing ideas and actions of different entities, resulting in an antagonistic state. Conflict is an inevitable part of life. All of us possess our own opinions, ideas and sets of beliefs. We have our own ways of looking at things and we act according to what we think is proper. Hence, we often find ourselves in conflict in different scenarios; it may involve other individuals, groups of peoples or a struggle within our ownselves. Consequently, conflict influences our actions and decisions in one way or other.\n1. Disagreement among groups or individuals → 2. → 3. → 4. → 5. → 6.",

But in the whole length and breadth of India there is not a single university established in the modern time where a foreign or an Indian student can properly be acquainted with the best products of the Indian mind.

          "label": "",
          "question": "",
          "explanation": "Adulteration of Foodstuff: Causes and Consequences\nAdulteration of foodstuff refers to the practice of intentionally adding harmful, low-quality, or synthetic substances to food items in order to increase profits. It is a serious issue that affects public health and undermines consumer trust. Adulterated food is often cheaper to produce but can pose significant health risks to those who consume it unknowingly.\nCauses of Food Adulteration\nOne of the primary causes of food adulteration is the economic motive behind it. Sellers and manufacturers may use adulterants to increase the quantity or shelf life of food products, thereby reducing costs. For example, low-quality or artificial substances are often added to increase the weight of spices, grains, or beverages. This is especially common in the case of products like milk, tea, sugar, and edible oils.\nThe lack of stringent regulations and enforcement also contributes to the prevalence of food adulteration. In many countries, food safety laws are not strictly implemented, allowing unscrupulous traders to exploit gaps in the system. In some cases, poor awareness among consumers about food safety and quality standards makes it easier for adulterated food to enter the market without detection.\nAnother significant cause is the greed of certain manufacturers and traders. In their quest for higher profits, they compromise on quality and safety. For instance, chemicals, artificial colorants, and preservatives are added to food items like fruits, vegetables, and sweets to make them look fresh and appealing, despite the potential health risks they pose.\nConsequences of Food Adulteration\nThe consequences of food adulteration are severe and can have both short-term and long-term effects on health. Immediate reactions to consuming adulterated food can include food poisoning, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which can be particularly dangerous for children and the elderly.\nLong-term consumption of adulterated food can lead to chronic health problems, such as liver and kidney damage, cancer, and reproductive issues. For instance, the addition of harmful chemicals like formalin in fish or milk can lead to severe health complications over time. The accumulation of toxic substances in the body can weaken the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to diseases.\nIn addition to health risks, food adulteration also leads to economic losses for consumers. People pay for food products that are often less nutritious or potentially harmful. This can cause financial strain, especially in lower-income communities where access to safe food is already limited.\nMoreover, food adulteration damages the reputation of businesses and industries that rely on consumer trust. Once a brand is associated with adulterated food, it can lose its customers and face legal consequences, leading to long-term financial losses.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, food adulteration is a harmful practice with far-reaching consequences. The causes are multifaceted, including economic motives, lack of regulation, and consumer ignorance. The effects on health and the economy are undeniable, making it imperative for governments to enforce strict food safety regulations and for consumers to remain vigilant. Only through collective efforts can we ensure that the food we consume is safe, nutritious, and free from harmful adulterants."

          "explanation": "Once upon a time a river ran through a green field. There lived an ant beside the stream. One day the ant went to stream to drink water. While drinking water, suddenly the ant fell into the running water.\n“Help! Help!” shouted the ant. But no one heard him. A dove was sitting on a tree near the stream and saw the miserable condition of the ant. The dove felt pity.\nVery quickly the dove broke off a wide leaf and throw nearer to the ant. The little ant climbed onto the leaf. Soon the leaf struck in some reeds and the ant climbed onto the bank. What a lucky escape!\nAfter a few days the ant was looking for food beside the stream. He stood still hearing the cooing of a dove. The ant saw that it was the same dove that saved his life. It was very happy to see the dove and wanted to show his gratefulness by waving but of no use.\nThen to his utter horror he found a hunter carrying a bow and an arrow. The hunter quietly drew took his gun and aimed at the dove. Just at that moment the ant bit very seriously on the hunter’s leg. So, the hunter’s aim failed and it hit a branch of the tree. The dove flapped her wings and flew off in a hurry.\n\nThe hunter bent down to look. There was a tiny red mark on his leg. And the ant? It was nowhere to bee seen!\n"
