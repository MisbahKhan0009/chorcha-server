          "explanation": "The pie chart displays the various sources of air pollution in a city, highlighting five key contributors. Vehicles are by far the most significant source, accounting for 60% of total air pollution. This indicates a heavy reliance on private and commercial transportation, possibly due to limited public transport infrastructure. Industry is the second-largest contributor at 18% , reflecting emissions from factories and manufacturing units. Power plants contribute 13% , suggesting that electricity generation—likely from fossil fuels—is another major pollutant. Waste disposal activities are responsible for 3% , while heating or using gas contributes nothing ( 0% ), showing negligible or highly controlled emissions in that category.\nThe disparity is stark: vehicles alone contribute more than all other sources combined, underscoring the urgent need for cleaner transport alternatives and stricter vehicular emission controls. In contrast, waste disposal and gas usage have a minimal impact, suggesting these are not major areas of concern. Targeted interventions in transport and industry could significantly improve air quality."

All on a sudden, she woke up, raised her head and told him to give her a glass of water. Bayazid went to the kitchen to bring water but the pitcher was empty. He thought to fetch water from a distant fountain. He went alone to the fountain with the pitcher and came back home with the pitcher full of water. In the meantime, his mother was fast asleep again. He did not want to disturb his ailing mother. So, he remained standing whole night beside his mother's bed. In the morning, Bayazid's mother awoke. She became astonished to see her son standing with the glass full of water beside her bed. She embraced her son with deep love and prayed to Almighty Allah for her son. In his later life, Bayazid became a great saint."

I understand that you're feeling apprehensive about English, but I'm here to assure you that with a bit of effort and the right approach, you can become competent in English.\nFirstly, it's essential to change your mindset about learning English. Instead of seeing it as a daunting task, try to view it as a fun and exciting journey. Remember, everyone starts somewhere, and making mistakes is a natural part of the learning process.\nTo improve your English skills, here are some practical steps you can take:\n1. Start Small : Begin by learning basic vocabulary and common phrases. You can use flashcards, language learning apps, or online resources to help you memorize words.\n2. Practice Regularly : Consistency is key. Try to dedicate a little time each day to practice reading, writing, listening, and speaking in English. You can read English books or articles, listen to podcasts or songs, and even engage in conversations with English speakers if possible.\n3. Set Realistic Goals : Set achievable goals for yourself, such as learning a certain number of new words each week or improving your pronunciation. Celebrate your progress along the way to stay motivated.\n4. Immerse Yourself : Surround yourself with English as much as possible. Watch English movies or TV shows, listen to English radio stations, and try to think in English. Immersion can significantly accelerate your learning process.\n5. Don't Be Afraid to Make Mistakes : Remember that making mistakes is part of learning any new language. Don't let fear hold you back from practicing or speaking English. Embrace your errors as opportunities to improve.\n6. Seek Feedback : If you have the opportunity, ask for feedback from English speakers or teachers. Constructive criticism can help you identify areas for improvement and refine your skills.\n7. Stay Motivated : Find reasons to stay motivated, whether it's to advance your career, communicate with people from different cultures, or simply challenge yourself. Remind yourself of your goals and the benefits of learning English.\nAbir, I believe in you. Learning English may seem daunting at first, but with perseverance and dedication, you'll undoubtedly become more competent in the language. Feel free to reach out to me if you need any support or encouragement along the way.\nBest wishes,\nMahin"

(One is done for you.)\nAt daylight I was half wakened by the sound of chopping. Again it was so even in texture that went back to sleep. When I left my bed in the cool morning, the boy had come and gone, and a stack of kindling was neat against the cabin wall. He came arter school in the afternoon and worked until time to return to the orphanage. His name was Jerry ... he had been at the orphanage since he was four. I could picture him at four. with the same grave gray-blue eyes and the same independence? No, the word that comes to me is \"integrity\". ‥ It is bedded on courage, but it is more than brave. It is honest, but it is more than honesty. The ax handle broke one day. Jerry said the woodshop at the orphanage would repair it. I brought money to pay for the job and he refused it. \"I'll pay for it,\" he said. \"I broke it. I brought the ax down.careless.\" \"But no one hits accurately every time,\" I told him. \"The fault was in the wood of the handle. I'll see the man from whom I bought it.\" It was only then that he would take the money. He was standing back of his own carelessness. He was a free-will agent and he chose to do careful work, and if he failed, he took the responsibility without subterfuge.\nChopping wood in the morning→\n2. →\n3.→\n4.→\n5.\n6.",

(No. 1 has been done for you.)\nFrequent consumption of junk food increases the intake of excess fat, simple carbohydrates, and processed sugar which may lead to a higher risk of obesity and cardio vascular diseases, among other chronic health problems. The resulting obesity may begin clogging up the arteries and lay the basis of an impending heart attack. It has also been suggested that eating junk food affects the brain in the same way as consuming addictive drugs. An addiction to junk food may even result in the rejection of healthier food options like fruits, vegetables, salads etc. leading to further lack of nourishment.\n1.

      "uddipok": "Write a summary of the following text.\nThe famous Greek philosopher Aristotle said, \"Man is by nature a social animal.\" What he meant was that man, by instinct, seeks company of others and establishes relationships, much like most animals of the wild, for companionship and for physical and emotional support. Unlike the animals however, man's relationships give meaning to his existence and inspires him to do well in education, in workplace or in a profession that he pursues.\nRelationships are of different kinds. Some are familial and intimate, formed by blood and by marriage; some are social like the ones we have with friends and some are made in school where we, form close bonds with classmates and teachers. Relationships can also be fostered in workplace, which may quickly change from professional to social. There are relationships also between human beings and animals, between children and their toys that they cannot part with.\nAll these relationships keep us close to each other and provide us all kinds of support, love and affection. A person who has no family feels the pain of loneliness and isolation. There is no one to laugh or cry with him/her. When we share our joy with someone, it simply redoubles, and when we suffer a loss and someone shares our sorrow, it lessens. Relationships are thus needed for our emotional health.\nTo build relationships, we need to have trust and respect for each other, and love where this is needed. We cannot be selfish and possessive if we want to establish an effective relationship. But quite often we see people quarrelling and fighting with each other which only brings misery and loss to all.",

          "explanation": "The passage portrays the fact that human beings naturally develop different types of relationships through trust, respect and love. Relationships are formed by blood or marriage, in educational institutions or workplaces, etc. Relationships give meaning to our existence and inspire us to perform well in every stage. Moreover, relationships fill our life with love, support, and endearment. Lonely and isolated people cannot share their joy or sorrow. Through sharing, happiness increases, and sorrows decreases. Hence, relationships are essential for mental health. However, relationships with selfishness and possessiveness are detrimental to mental health and cause sufferings."
