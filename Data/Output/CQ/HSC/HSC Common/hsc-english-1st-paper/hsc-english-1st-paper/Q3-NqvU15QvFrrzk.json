They didn't have any boots or jerseys to wear. Initially, they played wearing salwar and kamij. They also suffered from malnutrition. What made them win against all adversities then? What was the magic behind? Mohammad Mafiz Uddin was an assistant teacher at Kalsindur Government Free Primary School where Minati Rani Sheel was the head teacher. They observed the girls' interests in football and decided to help. It was however not that easy. Girls playing football is still not a common picture in Bangladesh. Guardians were not convinced as they were used to seeing girls helping mothers with household chores. A farmer, an auto-rickshaw driver, a tea-shop owner or a housemaid mother couldn't be that ambitious either. But Minati Rani Sheel and Mohammad Mafiz Uddin persuaded them to allow their daughters to play. Being great motivators, the two teachers supported the girls in their effort to overcome the odds. They inspired them, created opportunities for them and took personal care of them. Soon the girls could prove themselves, shaking off their inhibition. Their success has also persuaded the villagers to come to their support.",

          "explanation": "This paragraph depicts the story and victory of Kalsindur girls. The story of Kalsindur girls is as incredible as it is heart-warming. Mohammad Mafiz Uddin, an assistant teacher at Kalsindur Government Free Primary School, and Minati Rani Sheel, the head teacher sought out to help the girls who were enthusiastic to play football. Though it is not easy for the villagers of an underdeveloped country like Bangladesh to believe that girls could play football, the teachers convinced the guardians to support their daughters in the pursuit of greatness. Finally, the girls could prove themselves and their success could persuade the villagers to support them."

These foods are prepared in a way that they look appealing and are enjoyable so you are chemically programmed to ask for more. According to Dr. Sunali Sharma, a Dietician & Nutritionist, \"Commercial products including salted snack foods, chewing gum, candy, sugary deserts, fried fast food and sweetened carbonated beverages that have little or no nutritional value but are high in calories, salt and fats may be considered junk foods. Though not all fast foods are junk foods, a great number of them are. For instance, a salad may be fast food but is definitely not junk food. Some foods like burgers, pizzas, and tacos may alternate between junk and healthy categories depending on the ingredients, calories and process of manufacturing.\"\n1.

      "uddipok": "Write a summary of the following passage.\nEducation aims to bring about positive changes in our behavior. It helps us try to change our lives as well as the society we live in. Education that does not illuminate our minds or does not inspire us to work for the community is not complete at all. Education is not all about getting grades or receiving certificates- we use education to make life better. We are expected to apply the knowledge, skills and values that we learn in a classroom in our engagement with the world that lies outside. And we can do so in many different ways. Let's have a look at how education works. Learners' civic engagement is highly appreciated all over the world. Civic engagement means working to make a difference in the civic life (the public life of the citizens as constructed with private or personal life) of the community using knowledge, skills, values and motivation. Civic engagement promotes the quality of life in a community by contributing to the improvement of health and wellbeing of the people.\nCivically engaged individuals recognize themselves as members of a larger social community and are concerned about civic issues. They consider themselves responsible citizens who take action or raise their voices against injustice, discrimination and other forms of social ills.\nIn civic engagement, issues of public concern are crucial. Civic engagement includes individual or group activities to protect public interests and change the way the community values itself. For example, If you are protesting against any unjust decision of the local municipality such as raising taxes or an act that might work against people's interests, you are civically engaged and your action is considered a civic engagement. This protest can be done in different ways such as organizing rallies, collecting signatures, making human chains, writing petitions, etc. You can also help control traffic in front of a school, help children to cross the roads, work in a team to clean a park or a sea beach. You can also give some services to elderly people. These are all examples of civic engagement as what you do directly affects the community.\nWhen civic engagement is a part of an academic program, and the learners' engagement is assessed following a scale, then it is called service learning. It involves the application of knowledge and skills learned in the classroom and then making a complete plan of action 1.e. preparing a budget, starting the process of implementation, involving people and activating operational strategies.",

A civically engaged person works to create a difference in the civic life taking action or raising voice against injustice, discrimination and other forms of social ills. When we work for social welfare, we are civically engaged. Civic engagement may be individual or group activities. For example, we can raise voice against raising excessive taxes. This protest can be done by organising ralles, collecting signature, making human chains, etc. Learners engagement is evaluated by following a scale.

          "explanation": "The Turning Tide\nBut after his Test Exam, the reality of his poor performance hit him like a cold wave. Raihan had barely scraped through the qualifying exams, and the look of silent disappointment on his father’s face was harder to bear than any scolding. Something inside him shifted. He realized that if he failed the final HSC exams, the doors to his future would slam shut.\nWith only a few months left, Raihan transformed his lifestyle. He deactivated his social media accounts and created a strict study bridge. He began waking up at 4:00 AM, utilizing the quiet hours of the dawn to memorize complex theories and solve mathematical problems. He sought help from his teachers, who were surprised but encouraged by his sudden dedication.\nWhen the HSC results were finally published, Raihan stared at the screen in disbelief. He had not only passed but had obtained a brilliant GPA, far exceeding everyone's expectations. This success taught him a life-altering lesson: it is never too late to turn over a new leaf. His \"unexpected\" marks were not a matter of luck, but the harvest of his late-night oil and newfound discipline."

          "explanation": "Dear Sonia,\nGuess what? I heard you're learning English in school! That's super cool! It might feel a little confusing at first, but I wanted to tell you why I think it's awesome.\nFor one thing, English is like a superpower for talking to people. Imagine being able to chat with kids from all over the world – like America, Canada, or even way down under in Australia! You could learn about their lives and cultures, and make tons of new friends.\nPlus, English unlocks a whole treasure chest of stuff! So many books, websites, and even movies are only in English. Once you learn it, it'll be like having a secret code to understand all sorts of cool things. You could read stories by famous English authors, watch movies without needing subtitles, or even find out anything you want online – just because you understand English!\nLearning English might even help you get a great job later on. Many cool jobs look for people who can speak English, and knowing two languages makes you a superstar! Who knows, maybe someday you'll even get to travel to an English-speaking country and use your skills there!\nLearning a new language takes practice, but it's totally worth it. There are even fun ways to learn English, like watching movies, listening to music, or even playing games! Remember, if you ever want to practice, I'm always here to help you out.\nKeep rocking those studies, Sonia! I'm so proud of you for learning something new.\nWarmest regards,,\nJinia"
