And these books constitute 20 % 20 \\% 20% of the total books i.e. 2,000 books of the library.\nThus, it is clear as we find from the pieces of information in the chart that books on literature occupy (দধन করা) the first position, while books on History occupy(দখল করা) the last position in respect of the collection of books in the said library. Indeed, the number of books in a college library depends largely on the demand (চাহিদা) of the readers. Books on technology, should be included in a college library. The ratio of books in the library is, as a whole, rational (যৌক্তিক)."

She called in a doctor who after examining her told her that her eyesight could be restored (ফিরিয়ে দেওয়া), but would charge a high sum for It. The lady agreed on the condition that she would pay the fee only if she got cured but she would not pay anything if she did not get her vision (দৃষ্টি) back.\nThe doctor began his treatment. He, operating on her eyes, bandaged them and prescribed some medicine. The doctor was a dishonest man. He noticed many valuable things and many pieces of costly furniture in the house. He contrived (মতলব আটা) to steal those things. According to his plan, he began to take those things stealthily to his house. The blind lady was quite in the dark about his stealing as she could not see anything. Eventually the lady got cured. She noticed that there was no furniture and costly thing in her house. The doctor asked for his payment but the lady reffused to pay. She said that her cure was not complete. The doctor filed a lawsuit (মামলা) against the lady. Going to the court, the lady said that her sight was not restored as she could not see the furniture and costly things in her house. The judge realized the matter. He passed the judgement in favour of the lady and meted out due punishment to the dishonest doctor.\n"

      "uddipok": "Education not only enriches us with knowledge, abilities and skills, it also teaches us values. Values can be individual, interpersonal, organizational or societal. Thus, students receiving good education develop self-respect but also learn to respect others; they know the importance of honesty and learn to trust others; they develop compassion and fellow feeling and become aware of the need to protect the environment. If students combine the values they learn at home with those that the school gives them, they will not deviate from the right path unless they fall into bad company. The famous French writer Victor Hugo (1802-1895) once said, \"He who opens a school door, closes a prison.\" Below are a couple of stories about values that we must cherish. Read the stories and find out why these values are important 'in our lives. Do you think you also possess these values? If so, where did you learn them?\nStory 1: The Starfish Story:\nAn old man walked along the beach until he came across a young boy throwing something into the breakin wavese Upon Undy beach back inspection, into th the the old old man could see that the boy was tossing stranded \"What are you doing, young man?\" He asked.\n\"If the starfish are still on the beach when the sun rises, they will die, so I am throwing them into the water,\" the boy answered. \"This is ridiculous. There are a hundred miles of beach and thousands and thousands of starfish. It doesn't matter how many you throw in; you can't make a difference.\"\n\"It matters to this one,\" the boy said. As he threw another starfish into the waves he told the old man, \"and it matters to this one too.\"\"\nStory 2: Finding Happiness:\nOnce a group of 50 people were attending a seminar. At one stage, the speaker decided to do a group activity to illustrate a point he was making. He gave a balloon to each attendee. Each one was asked to write his/her name on it using a another room. marker pen. He then collected all the balloons and put them in\nHe then took all the attendees to the room and asked them to find the balloon with their name within five minutes. Everyone frantically searched for the balloon with their name, colliding with each other. pushing around others and there was utter chaos.\nAt the end of five minutes, no one could find their own balloon. Now, the speaker asked each one to randomly collect a balloon and give it to the person whose name was written on it. Within minutes, everyone had their own balloon.\nThe speaker then began, \"This is happening in our lives. Everyone is frantically looking for happiness, not knowing where it is. Our happiness lies in the happiness of other people. Give them their happiness, you will get your own happiness. And this is the purpose of human life the pursuit of happiness.\"",

(One has been done for you):\nThe Island of St. Martin is the only coral island in Bangladesh located in the north-eastern part of Bay of Bengal. The roughly flat island is only above 3.6 metre above the sea level. The entire island can be walked about in 3 hours. The island is known for its unique natural beauty with white sandy beaches fringed with coconut palms and a diverse marine life. Due to the expansion of unregulated tourism, the island is facing increasing erosion, contamination of surface and ground water, wildlife displacement, and loss of biodiversity. Other threats include cutting of sand dune vegetation for fuel-wood and hotel establishment; degradation of sand dune habitat; the harvesting of turtle eggs; indiscriminate exploitation of coral resources etc. To address this, the Government has declared some areas of the island as Ecologically Critical Area (ECA), prohibiting unauthorized constructions there.\nOnly coral island in Bangladesh → 2. → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6",

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following passage.\nWe spend money for different reasons. We buy foods, clothes or everyday essentials, pay for different services, entertain people, travel to places, help others in need or invest in business and thus spend money every day. In fact, spending is a part of our life.\nSpending may make us happy or unhappy depending on how and why we spend. When we spend money on things that we need and within our limit, it is good. When it becomes a compulsive behaviour, it makes life stressful. Unnecessary spending or spending beyond one's means has some bad effects. For one thing, it may lead to financial ruin or debt, and for another,. it may create unhappiness within families. People who overspend are never satisfied with what they have. They always rush for brands, fashion items, designer clothes, etc. Over a period of time, it becomes an addiction which may eventually create psychological problems.\nNowadays, consumer items are displayed in stores or in advertisements in ways that they create a feeling of immediate need for them. We are constantly tempted to buy, use or consume things even when we do not have a genuine need. We all need to be careful here. Salespersons often encourage customers to buy things by flattering them. 'This is a perfect match for you,' they would say. or 'You look so stunning in that dress.' Never forget, they say the same thing to most of their customers. It is better not to be persuaded by such words. They use these words to please the customers as the more a customer buys, the higher the profit is. Overspending is not only related to shopping, it applies to other activities as well such as eating out. Many people buy too many items to eat in a restaurant. They can eat only some of them and the rest are wasted: It's not a responsible attitude. We cannot simply waste food because we have money to buy it.\nYoung people in a shopping mall often look at an item on display afd think 'Oh I must buy this. I really need this.' They may not have the money needed. In their wallet. So, they use credit cards but using them is like taking a loan. If they are not careful, the loans increase which might lead them to a debt-trap.\nSometimes children insist on buying things that their parents cannot pay without stretching their budget. This may happen because the children's friends also have them. It's not fair as it becomes a burden for the parents.\nFinally, don't get trapped by the glossy advertisements on television or the Internet. You should rather ask yourself: \"Do I need this?\" The best way to control the habit of spending is not to think 'What I need', but 'Can I do without it?'",

          "explanation": "Money is spent every day for various reasons. Necessary expenses within our limit may make us happy. But unnecessary expenditure or spending money beyond our ability creates some problems and may lead to psychological problems. At present, consumer items are exhibited and advertised so attractively that we want to buy them immediately even without having a genuine need. Salespersons often flatter the customers to encourage them to buy more things. Buying more foods than requirements and their wastage means wastage of money. Children also make their parents fall in economic crisis by pressurizing them to buy unnecessary things. We should restrain this habit of overspending by asking ourselves if we can do without the thing we feel tempted to buy."
