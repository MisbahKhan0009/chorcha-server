          "explanation": "\n(a)\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines adolescence as the period of life between 10 and 19 years of age. This stage marks the transition from childhood to adulthood, characterized by significant physical, emotional, and social development. Adolescents experience rapid growth and undergo various changes that influence their health, behavior, and interactions with society.\n(b)\nAccording to the 2022 Bangladesh Census, the population of adolescents aged 10–14 is approximately 16.6 million, with 8.5 million boys and 7.8 million girls. For the 15–19 age group, there are about 16.5 million adolescents, comprising 8.1 million boys and 8.5 million girls. In total, adolescents make up about 28.8% of Bangladesh's population, with a near-equal distribution between boys and girls.\n(c)\nAdolescent girls in Bangladesh face several challenges\nChild Marriage : Approximately 51% of girls in Bangladesh are married before the age of 18, making it one of the highest rates globally.\nEducation : While enrollment rates for girls have improved, many still face barriers to completing secondary education, especially in rural areas.\nHealth Risks : Early pregnancies pose significant health risks, with many adolescent girls becoming mothers before reaching adulthood.\nViolence and Abuse : A significant number of adolescent girls experience physical or sexual violence, often within intimate relationships.\nThese issues hinder their development and access to opportunities, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.\n(d)\nIn Bangladesh, the legal age for marriage is 18 for girls and 21 for boys, as stipulated by the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 2017. However, the law includes provisions that allow for exceptions under certain circumstances, such as parental consent and court approval, which have been criticized for potentially undermining efforts to prevent child marriage.\n(e)\nWhile the legal age for marriage is 21 for boys in Bangladesh, readiness for marriage is influenced by various factors beyond age, including emotional maturity, financial stability, and societal expectations. Cultural norms often dictate that men should be established in their careers and capable of supporting a family before marriage. However, these expectations can vary widely across different communities and regions within the country."

      "uddipok": "Read the following passage and make a flow chart showing the nature and functions of dream. (one is done for you):\nDreams have fascinated philosophers for thousands of years, but only recently have dreams been subjected to empirical research and scientific study. Changes are that you've often found yourself puzzling over the content of a dream, or perhaps you've wondered why you dream at all. First, lets's start by answering a basic question: What is a dream? A dream can include any of the images, thoughts and emotions that are experienced during sleep. Dreams can be extraordinarily vivid or very vague; filled with joyful emotions or frightening images; focused and understandable or unclear and confusing. Why do we dream? What purpose do dreams serve? While many theories have been proposed about the reason and function of dreams, no consensus has emerged. Considering the time we spend in a dreaming state, the fact that researchers do not yet understand the purpose of dreams may seem baffling. However, it is important to consider that science is still unraveling the exact purpose and function of sleep itself. Some researchers suggest that dreams serve no real purpose, while others believe that dreaming is essential to mental, emotional and physical well-being.\n1. images during sleep. → 2. → 3. → 4. → 5. → 6.",

      "uddipok": "Write a summary of the following text:\nEducation aims to bring about positive changes in our behaviour. It helps us try to change our lives as well as the society we live in. Education that does not illuminate our minds or does not inspire us to work for the community is not complete at all. Education is not all about getting grades or receiving certificates we use education to make life better. We are expected to apply the knowledge, skills and values that we learn in a classroom in our engagement with the world that lies outside. And we can do so in many different ways. Let's have a look at how education works.\nLearners' civic engagement is highly appreciated all over the world.\nCivic engagement means working to make a difference in the civic life (the public life of the citizens as contrasted with private or personal life) of the community using knowledge, skills, values and motivation. Civic engagement promotes the quality of life in a community by contributing to the improvement of health and wellbeing of the people.\nCivically engaged individuals recognize themselves as members of a larger social community and are concerned about civic issues. They consider themselves responsible citizens who take action or raise their voices against injustice, discrimination and other forms of social ills.\nIn civic engagement, issues of public concern are crucial. Civic engagement includes individual or group activities to protect public interests and change the way the community values itself. For example, if you are protesting against any unjust decision of the local municipality such as raising taxes or an act that might work against people's interest, you are civically engaged and your action is considered a civic engagement. This protest can be done in different ways such as organizing rallies, collecting signatures, making human chains, writing petitions etc. You can also help control traffic in front of a school, help children to cross the roads, work in a team to clean a park or a sea beach. You can also give some service to elderly people. These are all examples of civic engagement as what you do directly affects the community.",

          "explanation": "Education aims to bring positive changes in individuals and society by encouraging the application of knowledge, skills, and values beyond the classroom. True education goes beyond grades and certificates; it inspires learners to engage with their communities and address real-world issues. Civic engagement, a key outcome of meaningful education, involves taking responsible actions to improve public life and address social problems. It includes activities like protesting injustice, organizing community events, helping others, and improving public spaces. Such actions reflect a commitment to the well-being of the community and show how education can lead to active and responsible citizenship."

The kind dove quickly plucked a leaf and dropped it into the river near the ant. The ant climbed onto the leaf and floated safely to the shore. He thanked the dove for saving his life.\nA few days later, the ant saw a hunter aiming his bow at the dove. Without wasting time, the ant crawled up and bit the hunter’s foot. The hunter missed his aim, and the dove flew away safely.\nThus, the ant repaid the dove’s kindness, proving that even a small creature can help in a big way."

In college, we organized a program with cultural performances, speeches, and patriotic songs. The teachers and students participated enthusiastically. The national flag was hoisted, and we all sang the national anthem together.\nThere were also speeches about the history and significance of the day, reminding us of the sacrifices made by our freedom fighters. The atmosphere was full of pride and patriotism.\nCelebrating 16th December at college helped me understand how important freedom and unity are for our country. I wish you could have been here to join us!\nTake care and write back soon.\nYour friend, Mushifiq"
