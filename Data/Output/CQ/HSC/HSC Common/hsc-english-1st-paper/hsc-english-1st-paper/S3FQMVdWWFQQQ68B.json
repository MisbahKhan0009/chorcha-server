          "question": "",
          "explanation": "\n(a) What unnecessary things did Jerry do for the authoress?\nIn the story, the narrator (the \"authoress\") purchases a roll-top desk from a junk shop and begins restoring it. While repairing the desk, he finds a secret compartment containing a letter written by Jim Macpherson to his wife, Connie. The narrator then takes the letter to Mrs. Macpherson, believing it to be a meaningful gesture. However, Mrs. Macpherson mistakes him for her late husband, Jim, and is overjoyed to receive the letter. In this context, the \"unnecessary\" action refers to the narrator's decision to open the desk and read the letter, which was intended to be kept private. While his actions were well-meaning, they were not necessary for Mrs. Macpherson's\n(b) How would Jerry usually react after getting gifts from the authoress?\nThe story does not provide information about Jerry receiving gifts from the authoress. The focus is on the narrator's discovery of the letter and his subsequent visit to Mrs. Macpherson. Therefore, there is no information available regarding Jerry's reactions to receiving gifts.\n(c) Why did Jerry refuse to take money from the authoress to repair the ax handle?\nThe story does not mention any character named Jerry or an incident involving the repair of an ax handle. The narrative centers on the narrator's restoration of the roll-top desk and the discovery of Jim Macpherson's letter. There is no reference to Jerry or an ax handle in the story.\n(d) Why was the authoress impressed with Jerry?\nAs previously mentioned, the story does not feature a character named Jerry. The authoress (the narrator) is impressed by the kindness and love expressed in Jim Macpherson's letter to his wife, Connie. The narrator is moved by the soldiers' temporary truce during World War I and their shared humanity, which is reflected in Jim's letter.(Study Rankers)\n(e) Do you like the personality of Jerry? Why?\nSince there is no character named Jerry in the story, it is not possible to comment on his personality. However, the narrator's actions demonstrate curiosity, empathy, and a desire to connect with others. These qualities are commendable as they lead to a meaningful interaction with Mrs. Macpherson and the sharing of a poignant story of love and peace.\n"

Thus, (students receiving good education develop self-respect/but also learn to respect others; they know the importance of honesty and learn to trust others; they develop compassion and fellow feeling and become aware of the need to protect the environment.

We buy foods, clothes or everyday essentials, pay for different services, entertain people. travel to places, help others in need or invest in business and thus spend money everyday. In fact, spending is a part of our life. Spending may make us happy or unhappy depending on how and why we spend. When we spend money on things that we need and within our limit, it is good. When it becomes a compulsive behaviour. it makes life stressful. Unnecessary spending or spending beyond one's means has some bad effects. For one thing, it may lead to financial ruin or debt, and for another, it may create unhappiness within families. People who overspend are never satisfied with what they have. They always rush for brands, fashion items, designer clothes etc. Over a period of time it becomes an addiction which may eventually create psychological problems.",

His face was etched with deep lines of exhaustion, and his eyes, though clouded with age, held a desperate flicker of hope as the car’s headlights cut through the mist.\nDr. Rabbi immediately stepped out, the chill of the morning air stinging his skin. \"Are you alright, Father?\" he asked, his medical instincts overriding his fatigue. The old man tried to speak, but his teeth chattered too violently. He had no shoes, and his hands were purple from the early stages of frostbite.\nWithout a second thought, the doctor draped his own heavy woollen coat over the man’s shoulders and helped him into the warmth of the passenger seat. As the heater hummed to life, the man whispered that he had lost his way while searching for a nearby clinic. Dr. Rabbi realized that if he hadn't turned back, the man likely wouldn't have survived the morning.\nInstead of heading home to sleep, Dr. Rabbi drove to a local shelter, ensuring the man received a hot meal and medical attention. As he finally pulled into his own driveway, the exhaustion was still there, but his heart felt lighter. The foggy morning had reminded him why he became a doctor in the first place: to save lives, even those found by the side of a lonely road.\n"
