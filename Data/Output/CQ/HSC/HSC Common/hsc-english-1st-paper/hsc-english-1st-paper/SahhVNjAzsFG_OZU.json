          "explanation": "\nThe Sundarbans, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the largest mangrove forest in the world, spanning across India and Bangladesh. Its unique ecosystem is adapted to the brackish waters where freshwater from rivers meets the salty sea. This forest is renowned for its rich biodiversity, notably as the habitat of the Bengal tiger, making it famous globally. However, the Sundarbans face significant threats due to climate change, deforestation, and human activities such as pollution and poaching. These factors not only degrade the ecosystem but also endanger the survival of the majestic Bengal tiger. Despite the challenges, the Sundarbans remain vital to the national economy, serving as a crucial buffer against natural disasters, providing livelihoods for local communities through fishing and tourism, and supporting various industries such as agriculture and timber. Efforts to preserve this fragile ecosystem are essential for both environmental conservation and sustainable development in the region.\n"

          "explanation": "Title: \"The Price of Greed\"\nOnce a farmer had a goose. It used to lay a golden egg every day. The farmer used to sell them in the market and within a short time, he became quite solvent. But his wife was very greedy. She was not satisfied with one golden egg a day. She often grumbled, “If this goose lays one golden egg daily, there must be a heap of gold inside it!”\nBlinded by her greed, she convinced the farmer to kill the goose and collect all the gold at once. Though hesitant, the farmer finally gave in. They slaughtered the goose with great hope and tore it open—only to find nothing inside.\nThere was no heap of gold, not even a single extra egg. The magic was gone. The goose was dead, and with it, their daily fortune vanished.\nMoral: Greed destroys the source of good fortune.\n"

          "explanation": "Subject: Embrace the Joy of Sports: A Brotherly Reminder\nHey Rifat,\nI hope this email finds you in good health and high spirits. As your elder brother, I wanted to share some thoughts with you about the importance of incorporating sports and games into your routine.\nI've noticed lately that you've been spending a lot of time indoors, either with your studies or other activities. While I understand the importance of academics, I also believe it's crucial to strike a balance and nurture your physical well-being. That's where sports and games come in.\nEngaging in sports isn't just about physical exercise; it's about holistic development. It teaches you valuable lessons in teamwork, discipline, perseverance, and leadership – qualities that will serve you well in every aspect of life. Moreover, it's a fantastic stress reliever and can significantly improve your mood and overall mental health.\nRemember the joy we used to experience playing football together in the evenings? Those moments weren't just about scoring goals; they were about bonding, laughter, and creating lasting memories. I believe you can find that same joy and fulfillment by participating in sports regularly.\nWhether it's joining a local football team, hitting the basketball court with friends, or simply going for a jog in the park, I encourage you to make time for physical activity. Start small if you need to – even a short game of badminton or a brisk walk can make a world of difference.\nI know you have the potential to excel not just academically but also athletically. So, don't hesitate to explore different sports and find what you enjoy the most. Trust me; you won't regret it.\nTake care of yourself, Rifat, and remember that I'm always here to support you in all your endeavors.\nLooking forward to hearing about your sports adventures soon!\nWarm regards,\nShamim"

You must also have been taught to be polite in company and keep quiet while others, especially your elders, spoke. Possibly, you at times grudged such schooling. Possibly, at times you even protested such disciplining. Now, certainly you know that you can't always behave the way you want specially in the presence of others. There are rules of behavior you have to follow in a company. We are social beings and have to consider the effect of our behavior on others, even if we are at home and dealing with our family members.\nWe have two terms to describe our social behavior- 'etiquette' and 'manners'. 'Etiquette' is a French word and it means the rules of correct behavior in society. The word 'manners' means the behavior that is considered to be polite in a particular society or culture.\nManners can be good or bad. For example, it is a bad manner to speak with food in one's mouth. No one likes a bad mannered person. Remember that etiquette and manners vary from culture to culture and from society to society.",

          "explanation": "Summary:\nYou must have been taught as a young child to greet your elders and house guests in accordance with your culture and custom. Additionally, you must have been taught to be polite in public and to be silent when others, particularly your elders, spoke. Maybe you sometimes regretted your education. Maybe you even resisted such discipline at times. You are aware that you cannot always act in the way you like, especially when other people are present.\nEtiquette and manners are two words we use to describe how we behave in social situations. You can have good or awful manners. Speaking while chewing food, for instance, is impolite. A rude individual is not popular. Keep in mind that manners and etiquette differ from culture to culture and from society to society.\nEtiquette and manners are lessons we pick up from our parents, families, and other institutions like schools, colleges, or professional organisations."

The word is increasingly used for such people as a collective group or a community. The world has seen many diasporas but scholars have been studying the phenomenon with great interest only in recent decades. Among the great diasporas of history is that of the Jewish people, who were forced to leave their lands in ancient times. The movement of Aryans from Central Europe to the Indian sub-continent thousands of years ago is also noteworthy diaspora, although the causes of this diaspora is unclear. In twentieth century history, the Palestinian diaspora has attracted a lot of attention and been a cause of concern for world leaders because of the plight of Palestinians. There have been massive diasporas in Africa, too, over the centuries, either because of war or because of the ravages of nature. But the chief reason why the phenomenon of diaspora is attracting so much attention now is globalization",

The diasporas take shelter in foreign countries leaving their ancestral land, either because they are forced to leave their country or they leave willingly. Among the great diasporas of history, the Jewish Diaspora is highly remarkable. Again, the Aryans left their homeland, Central Europe, thousands of years ago, and settled in the Indian sub-continent. In twentieth century, the Palestinian Diaspora has drawn the attention of the world leaders because of the plight and miseries of the Palestinians. However, globalization has contributed much to the recent attention to diasporas."

(One is done for you):\nAccording to some myths and legends, Gazi Pir was a Muslim saint who is said to have spread Islam in the parts of Bengal close to the Sundarbans. He was credited with many miracles. For example, he could supposedly calm dangerous animals and make them docile. He is usually depicted in paats or scroll paintings riding a fierce-looking Bengal tiger, a snake in his hand, but in no apparent danger. According to some stories, he also fought crocodiles who threatened the people of a region full of canals and creeks, indeed, a kind of watery jungle bordering the Bay of Bengal. Because of his alert and vigilant presence, all predatory animals were said to have been kept within bounds. It was also believed that he enabled villagers to live close to forests and jungles and cultivate their lands.\n1. Close to the Sundarbans → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6.",
