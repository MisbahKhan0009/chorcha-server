She completed her earlier schooling at a local school. She is the first Indian-born woman and the second person in space from this subcontinent. After graduating in Aeronautical Engineering from Punjab Engineering College, Chawla moved to the United States in 1982. She obtained her Master's degree in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Texas. Later she did her PhD in Aerospace Engineering from the University of Colorado.\nDetermined to become an astronaut even in the face of the space shuttle Challenger disaster on 28 January 1986 that led to the deaths of its seven crew members, Chawla joined NASA in 1988. She began working as a Vice-President where she did Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) research on vertical take-off and landing. In 1991, she got U.S. citizenship and started her career as a NASA astronaut in 1995. She was selected for her first flight in 1996. She spoke the following words while travelling in the weightlessness of space. \"You are just your intelligence.\" She had travelled 10.67 million miles, as many as 252 times around the Earth.\nHer first space mission (Mission STS 87) began on 19 November 1997 with six other astronauts on the Space Shuttle Columbia. On her first mission that lasted for 15 days, 16 hours, 34 minutes and 4 seconds, she travelled 6.5 million miles. She was responsible for deploying the Spartan Satellite which, however, malfunctioned, necessitating a spacewalk by Winston Scott and Tako Dol, two of her fellow astronauts, to retrieve the satellite.\n\nBorn on 17 March 1962 in Karnal, India\n→\n\n2.\n→\n\n3.\n→\n\n4.\n→\n\n5.\n→\n\n6.",

      "uddipok": "Write a summary of the following passage.\nEducation aims to bring about positive changes in our behavior. It helps us try to change our lives as well as the society we live in. Education that does not illuminate our minds or does not inspire us to work for the community is not complete at all. Education is not all about getting grades or receiving certificates- we use education to make life better. We are expected to apply the knowledge, skills and values that we learn in a classroom in our engagement with the world that lies outside. And we can do so in many different ways. Let's have a look at how education works. Learners' civic engagement is highly appreciated all over the world. Civic engagement means working to make a difference in the civic life (the public life of the citizens as constructed with private or personal life) of the community using knowledge, skills, values and motivation. Civic engagement promotes the quality of life in a community by contributing to the improvement of health and wellbeing of the people.\nCivically engaged individuals recognize themselves as members of a larger social community and are concerned about civic issues. They consider themselves responsible citizens who take action or raise their voices against injustice, discrimination and other forms of social ills.\nIn civic engagement, issues of public concern are crucial. Civic engagement includes individual or group activities to protect public interests and change the way the community values itself. For example, If you are protesting against any unjust decision of the local municipality such as raising taxes or an act that might work against people's interests, you are civically engaged and your action is considered a civic engagement. This protest can be done in different ways such as organizing rallies, collecting signatures, making human chains, writing petitions, etc. You can also help control traffic in front of a school, help children to cross the roads, work in a team to clean a park or a sea beach. You can also give some services to elderly people. These are all examples of civic engagement as what you do directly affects the community.\nWhen civic engagement is a part of an academic program, and the learners' engagement is assessed following a scale, then it is called service learning. It involves the application of knowledge and skills learned in the classroom and then making a complete plan of action 1.e. preparing a budget, starting the process of implementation, involving people and activating operational strategies.",

A civically engaged person works to create a difference in the civic life taking action or raising voice against injustice, discrimination and other forms of social ills. When we work for social welfare, we are civically engaged. Civic engagement may be individual or group activities. For example, we can raise voice against raising excessive taxes. This protest can be done by organising ralles, collecting signature, making human chains, etc. Learners engagement is evaluated by following a scale. Rnowledge and skills learned in the school is applied. in society for public welfare."

The only thought which kept me worried, was that I must make it and that I must get good weather all the way. The second half of the swim is always very difficult. And if even little waves develop, it saps the ebbing energy of the swimmer all the more. Taking a lesson from my previous swims I kept my speed at a steady pace for I knew I would need every ounce of my energy towards the close. I felt hungry and famished and shouted for my manager. In reply, I was told that I could not afford to waste 10 minutes in having the feed! If I have to break the record, I must swim on with all my might. But I refused. I am sorry now for it. For if I had gone on. I might have finished the whole swim in less than 10 hours and 15 minutes creating a new world record from both sides…………",

The second half is the hardest, and even small waves deplete energy. The swimmer remembers needing to conserve energy for the end and ate only after refusing initially. They now regret this decision, believing it might have secured them a new world record under 10 hours and 15 minutes."

          "explanation": "The bar graph illustrates the steady increase in the number of internet users in Bangladesh from 2014 to 2019. The graph shows that in 2014, there were around 40 million users, which increased to approximately 60 million by 2015. Then, the number of users suddenly decreased and reached 50 million in 2016. Only this particular year marks a decrease in the number of users. Then, a significant surge occurred in 2017 and the number of internet users jumped to 70 million. This marks an increase highlighting a rapid growth in internet accessibility and usage. The number of users remained same in 2018. Finally, in 2019, the number of internet users took another jump and turned into 80 million in total. Analysing the graph, we find that within five years, the number of internet users in Bangladesh increased significantly, making it double. It is a clear indication that during this period, the country's digital infrastructure improved significantly. It also shows that people of Bangladesh are. getting accustomed to the modern technologies."

At that moment, the ant was walking. It slipped into the water and began to struggle desperately. The current was strong, and the poor ant was about to drown.\nJust then, a dove sitting on a nearby tree saw the ant in danger. Moved by compassion, the dove quickly plucked a leaf from the tree and dropped it into the river near the ant. The ant climbed onto the leaf and floated safely to the shore. It looked up at the dove with gratitude and silently promised to return the kindness someday.\nA few days later, a hunter came to the riverbank with a net. He aimed his weapon at the same dove resting peacefully on a branch. The ant noticed it and knew it had to act fast. It crawled to the hunter’s foot and bit him sharply. Startled, the hunter missed his aim, and the dove flew away to safety.\nThus, the ant repaid the dove’s kindness. Both went on with their lives, grateful for each other.\nMoral: A good deed is never forgotten."

Thank you for your interest in Bangladesh; I'd be happy to share more about my country with you.\nBangladesh is a beautiful country located in South Asia, bordered by India to the west, north, and east, with Myanmar (Burma) lying to the southeast. One of the most fascinating aspects of Bangladesh is its rich cultural heritage. We have a diverse population comprising various ethnic groups, religions, and languages, which contribute to our vibrant tapestry of traditions and customs.\nThe natural beauty of Bangladesh is truly breathtaking. We are blessed with lush green landscapes, picturesque rivers, and the world's largest river delta, the Sundarbans, home to the majestic Royal Bengal Tiger. Our cuisine is also something to behold, with mouthwatering dishes like biryani, hilsa fish curry, and pitha (traditional sweets) tantalizing taste buds across the nation.\nHowever, like any country, Bangladesh faces its share of challenges. We grapple with issues such as poverty, overpopulation, and environmental degradation. Yet, amidst these challenges, the resilience and spirit of the Bangladeshi people shine through.\nI would love to hear more about life in the U.K. and your experiences living there. Please feel free to ask me anything else you'd like to know about Bangladesh; I'm always eager to share more about my homeland.\nLooking forward to your next letter!\nWarm regards,\nAlif/Adrita"
