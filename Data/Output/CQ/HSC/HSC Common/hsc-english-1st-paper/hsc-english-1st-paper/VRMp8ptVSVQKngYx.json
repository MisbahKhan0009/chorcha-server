          "explanation": "The pie chart provides information about the percentages of types of transportation used by 800 students to come to college. From the graph, we cansee that the highest number of students come to college on bicycle which is about 45%. Then, the second position is claimed by the bus. Around 30% of the total students come to college by bus. On the other hand, the students who live near the college campus usually come to college on foot and their number is around 15%. Students of some rich families come to college by car. Their number is 10% of the total students. Hence, from the information of the graph, we can say that the communication system of the college is quite good. Again, we can say that most of the students reside near the college and so, they can come to college by bicycle, by bus, or on foot."

Again I looked up and found the star flashing more and more speedily. As I kept on star gazing, that particular star suddenly move very fast across the night sky to the lower right portion of the sky and stopped instantly. And to my surprise, I focused on it again and gave it a good look if what I really saw was real, About 10 sec from stopping, it again moved to the opposite direction of the sky on the lower left side of the sky and suddenly stopped again.\nThen a few seconds later, it moved again at a lighting speed in a different location across the sky--this time it was moving upper right side of the night sky and again it stopped instantly. Then a few seconds later it moved again in a very fast speed and never stopped until it suddenly vanished in the night sky."

(One is done for you.)\nAt daylight I was half wakened by the sound of chopping. Again it was so even in texture that went back to sleep. When I left my bed in the cool morning, the boy had come and gone, and a stack of kindling was neat against the cabin wall. He came arter school in the afternoon and worked until time to return to the orphanage. His name was Jerry ... he had been at the orphanage since he was four. I could picture him at four. with the same grave gray-blue eyes and the same independence? No, the word that comes to me is \"integrity\". ‥ It is bedded on courage, but it is more than brave. It is honest, but it is more than honesty. The ax handle broke one day. Jerry said the woodshop at the orphanage would repair it. I brought money to pay for the job and he refused it. \"I'll pay for it,\" he said. \"I broke it. I brought the ax down.careless.\" \"But no one hits accurately every time,\" I told him. \"The fault was in the wood of the handle. I'll see the man from whom I bought it.\" It was only then that he would take the money. He was standing back of his own carelessness. He was a free-will agent and he chose to do careful work, and if he failed, he took the responsibility without subterfuge.\nChopping wood in the morning→\n2. →\n3.→\n4.→\n5.\n6.",

          "question": "",
          "explanation": "\n(a)\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines adolescence as the period of life between 10 and 19 years of age. This stage marks the transition from childhood to adulthood, characterized by significant physical, emotional, and social development. Adolescents experience rapid growth and undergo various changes that influence their health, behavior, and interactions with society.\n(b)\nAccording to the 2022 Bangladesh Census, the population of adolescents aged 10–14 is approximately 16.6 million, with 8.5 million boys and 7.8 million girls. For the 15–19 age group, there are about 16.5 million adolescents, comprising 8.1 million boys and 8.5 million girls. In total, adolescents make up about 28.8% of Bangladesh's population, with a near-equal distribution between boys and girls.\n(c)\nAdolescent girls in Bangladesh face several challenges\nChild Marriage : Approximately 51% of girls in Bangladesh are married before the age of 18, making it one of the highest rates globally.\nEducation : While enrollment rates for girls have improved, many still face barriers to completing secondary education, especially in rural areas.\nHealth Risks : Early pregnancies pose significant health risks, with many adolescent girls becoming mothers before reaching adulthood.\nViolence and Abuse : A significant number of adolescent girls experience physical or sexual violence, often within intimate relationships.\nThese issues hinder their development and access to opportunities, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.\n(d)\nIn Bangladesh, the legal age for marriage is 18 for girls and 21 for boys, as stipulated by the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 2017. However, the law includes provisions that allow for exceptions under certain circumstances, such as parental consent and court approval, which have been criticized for potentially undermining efforts to prevent child marriage.\n(e)\nWhile the legal age for marriage is 21 for boys in Bangladesh, readiness for marriage is influenced by various factors beyond age, including emotional maturity, financial stability, and societal expectations. Cultural norms often dictate that men should be established in their careers and capable of supporting a family before marriage. However, these expectations can vary widely across different communities and regions within the country."
