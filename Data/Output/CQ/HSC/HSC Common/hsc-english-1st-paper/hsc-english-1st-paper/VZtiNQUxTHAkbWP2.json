However, 33% of our girls get married before they are 15 and 60% of them become mothers by the time they reach 19. When an adolescent girl gets married, she usually drops out of school and thus loses her mobility. She gets confined to full-time work in her in-law's household. She loses social status and all the opportunities of economic independence. In her in-law's house, she gets marginalized. She becomes vulnerable to all sorts of abuse, including dowry-related violence. In our country, it is still a common practice for the brides family to pay dowry. Dowry demands can continue even after marriage. An adolescent bride, even if her in-laws are supportive, faces enormous health risk during pregnancy and child birth. Majority of our people are uninformed or insufficiently informed about contraception and reproductive health.\n\nThis leads to increased mortality rates among adolescent brides during childbirth.\n1. Getting married early → 2. → 3. → 4. → 5. → 6.",

The years Mandela spend behind bars made him the world's most celebrated political prisoner and a leader of mythic stature for millions of Black South Africans and other oppressed people far beyond his country's borders. Charged with capital offences in the 1963 Rivonia Trial, his statement from the dock was his political testimony. \"During my lifetime I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people. I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination.\" \"I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities,\" he told the court. \"It is an ideal I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.\" Friends adored Mandela and fondly called him \"Madiba,\" the clan name by which he was known. People lauded his humanity, kindness and dignity.",

Mandela became a global symbol during his imprisonment, especially after the 1963 Rivonia Trial, where he declared his lifelong dedication to fighting both white and black domination. He expressed his commitment to achieving a democratic and free society based on equality and harmony, even if it meant sacrificing his life. Mandela, affectionately called \"Madiba\" by friends, was widely admired for his humanity, kindness, and dignity."

I found an old man groaning in pain, sitting on the wet ground. He looked pale and weak, clutching his chest. Concerned, I immediately went up to him and asked what had happened. He whispered that he hadn’t eaten in two days and was feeling very sick.\nWithout wasting time, I called a nearby shopkeeper and together we helped him sit more comfortably. I offered him a bottle of water and gave him some snacks I had in my bag. Then I called an ambulance from a local clinic. While waiting, the man told me he had no family and lived on the streets.\nThe ambulance arrived, and I went along to the clinic to make sure he got the help he needed. That day, I was late for class, but I felt that helping someone in need was far more important. It reminded me how a small act of kindness can make a big difference in someone’s life."
