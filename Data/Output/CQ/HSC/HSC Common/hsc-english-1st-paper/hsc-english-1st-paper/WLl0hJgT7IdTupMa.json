          "explanation": "The graph presents the engagement of the child labour in different sectors of ' X ' country from 2005 to 2016 . In the graph, the data shown are of three different sectors namely Agriculture, Industry and Service. The most striking feature of the graph is that with the passage of time child labour has been shifted from agriculture to Industry and Service. Actually, industrial sector has experienced a steady rise from 15 percent in 2005 to 29 percent in 2016 while service sector has seen a fluctuation having 23 percent in 2005 and 36 percent in 2012 , with a fall of 5 percent in 2016. Another important point is that agriculture has had a great fall from 62 percent in 2005 to 45 percent in 2012 ; then in 2016 it has lost another 5 percent of its child labour. Overall, the graph portrays how the economic activities of the very country have been shifting from agriculture to industry."

          "explanation": "The Lion and the Boar: A Lesson in Unity\nOnce on a summer day, the scorching heat of the sun induced a Lion and a Boar to come at the same moment to a small well to drink. They fiercely disputed which of them should drink first and were soon engaged in a vicious brawl.\nThe Lion, with its powerful claws and ferocious roar, lunged at the Boar, while the Boar retaliated with swift tusks and brute force. The sounds of their battle echoed through the surrounding wilderness as dust kicked up around them.\nAmidst the chaos, a cunning Fox, who had been observing from a distance, saw an opportunity to benefit from the conflict. With sly eyes gleaming, the Fox stealthily crept closer, keeping a safe distance from the raging beasts.\nAs the Lion and the Boar continued their struggle, the Fox darted towards the well, seizing the chance to quench its own thirst while the larger animals were preoccupied. With quick laps of its tongue, the Fox drank deeply from the cool water, savoring the refreshing relief from the oppressive heat.\nMeanwhile, the Lion and the Boar fought on, their energy waning with each passing moment. Their initial fury began to give way to exhaustion, and they soon realized the futility of their battle. Pausing for a moment to catch their breath, they exchanged wary glances, sensing a shift in their priorities.\nIt was then that they noticed the Fox, sated and smug, beside the well. Realization dawned upon them both simultaneously. In their pursuit of dominance over each other, they had neglected to consider the cunning of a third party.\nWith a grudging respect for the Fox's ingenuity, the Lion and the Boar called a truce. Recognizing that their conflict had only served to benefit the wily Fox, they decided to set aside their differences and forge an alliance instead.\nFrom that day forward, the Lion, the Boar, and the Fox formed an unlikely trio, each contributing their own strengths to support the group as a whole. Together, they roamed the wilderness, their bond a testament to the power of collaboration in the face of adversity. And though they had once been adversaries, they now stood united, bound by a newfound sense of camaraderie and mutual respect."

          "explanation": "Subject: Importance of Responsible Social Media Sharing\nDear [Younger Brother/Sister's Name],\nI hope this letter finds you well. As your older sibling, I feel it's important to share some advice regarding your social media activities, particularly concerning the sharing of news articles and information.\nIn today's digital age, social media has become a powerful tool for communication and information sharing. While it offers numerous benefits, it also comes with certain responsibilities. One of these responsibilities is ensuring that the information we share is accurate, reliable, and credible.\nI've noticed that lately, you've been sharing a lot of news articles and stories on your social media accounts without verifying their authenticity. While I understand the urge to stay informed and share interesting content with your friends and followers, it's crucial to remember that not everything you come across on the internet is true.\nSharing fake or baseless news can have serious consequences. Not only does it contribute to the spread of misinformation, but it can also harm the reputations of individuals and organizations unfairly targeted by false claims. Moreover, it can fuel unnecessary panic and confusion among people who may believe the misinformation to be true.\nBefore sharing any news article or story on your social media accounts, I urge you to take a moment to verify its credibility. Look for reliable sources, cross-check the information with other reputable news outlets, and consider the context in which the story is presented. If you're unsure about the accuracy of a particular piece of news, it's better to refrain from sharing it altogether.\nRemember that as a member of the online community, you have the power to influence others with the content you share. By being mindful of the information you share and prioritizing accuracy and credibility, you can contribute to a more informed and responsible digital environment.\nIf you ever come across news or information that you're unsure about, don't hesitate to reach out to me or other trusted sources for guidance. Together, we can work towards promoting responsible social media behavior and combating the spread of misinformation.\nThank you for taking the time to read this letter, and please know that I'm always here to offer support and guidance whenever you need it.\nTake care, and I look forward to seeing you soon.\nWarm regards,\n[Your Name]"

The Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. The Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. So, we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.... I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal. I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of 'interposition' and 'nullification', that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.\"",

He groomed himself up as a young man who earned success by dint of perseverance and commitment. When the Pakistan military began its genocide in Bangladesh, he joined the Liberation War and received military training at Camp Murtee located at the Himalayan foothills in India. The tall young man who carried himself with dignity and possessed remarkable traits of leadership became the ADC of General Ataul Goni, Osmani, the Commander in Chief of Bangladesh Armed Forces during the Liberation War.

          "explanation": "\n(a)\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines adolescence as the period of life between 10 and 19 years of age. This stage marks the transition from childhood to adulthood, characterized by significant physical, emotional, and social development. Adolescents experience rapid growth and undergo various changes that influence their health, behavior, and interactions with society.\n(b)\nAccording to the 2022 Bangladesh Census, the population of adolescents aged 10–14 is approximately 16.6 million, with 8.5 million boys and 7.8 million girls. For the 15–19 age group, there are about 16.5 million adolescents, comprising 8.1 million boys and 8.5 million girls. In total, adolescents make up about 28.8% of Bangladesh's population, with a near-equal distribution between boys and girls.\n(c)\nAdolescent girls in Bangladesh face several challenges\nChild Marriage : Approximately 51% of girls in Bangladesh are married before the age of 18, making it one of the highest rates globally.\nEducation : While enrollment rates for girls have improved, many still face barriers to completing secondary education, especially in rural areas.\nHealth Risks : Early pregnancies pose significant health risks, with many adolescent girls becoming mothers before reaching adulthood.\nViolence and Abuse : A significant number of adolescent girls experience physical or sexual violence, often within intimate relationships.\nThese issues hinder their development and access to opportunities, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.\n(d)\nIn Bangladesh, the legal age for marriage is 18 for girls and 21 for boys, as stipulated by the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 2017. However, the law includes provisions that allow for exceptions under certain circumstances, such as parental consent and court approval, which have been criticized for potentially undermining efforts to prevent child marriage.\n(e)\nWhile the legal age for marriage is 21 for boys in Bangladesh, readiness for marriage is influenced by various factors beyond age, including emotional maturity, financial stability, and societal expectations. Cultural norms often dictate that men should be established in their careers and capable of supporting a family before marriage. However, these expectations can vary widely across different communities and regions within the country."
