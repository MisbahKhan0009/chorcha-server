      "uddipok": "Write a summary of the following text.\nThe famous Greek philosopher Aristotle said, \"Man is by nature a social animal.\" What he meant was that man, by instinct, seeks company of others and establishes relationships, much like most animals of the wild, for companionship and for physical and emotional support. Unlike the animals however, man's relationships give meaning to his existence and inspires him to do well in education, in workplace or in a profession that he pursues.\nRelationships are of different kinds. Some are familial and intimate, formed by blood and by marriage; some are social like the ones we have with friends and some are made in school where we, form close bonds with classmates and teachers. Relationships can also be fostered in workplace, which may quickly change from professional to social. There are relationships also between human beings and animals, between children and their toys that they cannot part with.\nAll these relationships keep us close to each other and provide us all kinds of support, love and affection. A person who has no family feels the pain of loneliness and isolation. There is no one to laugh or cry with him/her. When we share our joy with someone, it simply redoubles, and when we suffer a loss and someone shares our sorrow, it lessens. Relationships are thus needed for our emotional health.\nTo build relationships, we need to have trust and respect for each other, and love where this is needed. We cannot be selfish and possessive if we want to establish an effective relationship. But quite often we see people quarrelling and fighting with each other which only brings misery and loss to all.",

          "explanation": "The passage portrays the fact that human beings naturally develop different types of relationships through trust, respect and love. Relationships are formed by blood or marriage, in educational institutions or workplaces, etc. Relationships give meaning to our existence and inspire us to perform well in every stage. Moreover, relationships fill our life with love, support, and endearment. Lonely and isolated people cannot share their joy or sorrow. Through sharing, happiness increases, and sorrows decreases. Hence, relationships are essential for mental health. However, relationships with selfishness and possessiveness are detrimental to mental health and cause sufferings."

She told me to go away Now she is married to another man. My father lives very far away. I want to go to him, but he won't take me either. I begged him to send me some money so that I could buy a bus ticket. I am still waiting. He has not answered: The streets are now my home. Sometimes I find work. I used to collect trash and sell it to a vendor. I stopped doing that after I had a serious infection and a doctor told me to stay away from the trash dump. Once I worked for an ice-cream shop owner and sold ice-cream on the beach. But I got no money in return. The owner of the shop gave me something to eat, and let me sleep in his hut at night. The work was difficult and painful. The ice-cream box is quite heavy when it is full. I had to walk for hours, offering my ice-cream to whoever wanted to buy.. There were days when I could not even sell one ice-cream. In a way, I am lucky because I am alive. My friends who work sorting rubbish in dumps often suffer from serious diseases. One of them was recently killed after he fell into a hole that opened up in the pile of trash. Many of us work for 10 to 12 hours, and get so little in return that we can't even buy food.",

          "explanation": "The passage follows the story of Amerigo, a 13-year-old boy who lives alone on the streets after being rejected by both his mother and father. His mother sent him away, and his father, who lives far away, has not responded to his pleas for help. Amerigo survives by finding occasional work, such as collecting and selling trash, despite the health risks involved. He once worked for an ice-cream shop but received no money, only food and a place to sleep. Despite the hardships, Amerigo considers himself fortunate to be alive, unlike some of his friends who have suffered serious illnesses or even death from their work in trash dumps. Many like him work long hours for minimal pay, struggling to afford basic necessities like food."

However, those who dream during the day are more likely to turn their dreams into reality. These dreamers are considered dangerous because of their ability to make their visions a tangible part of their lives."

For many different reasons, English has achieved the prestige of being that language. As a result, it has crossed national borders to reach people who speak other languages. It is no longer the unique possession of British or American people, but a language that belongs to the world's people. In fact, bilingual and multilingual users of English far outnumber its monolingual native speakers. This phenomenon has led to a bewildering variety of English around the world. As more and more people speak English, more and more varieties have emerged which are strongly influenced by the pronunciation, grammar and idioms of the respective mother tongues. World English has now moved away from the control of the native speakers. However, the question of British or American English is not so important now. Today's slogan is mutual intelligibility among users of the language.\n\n(a) obviously (synonym); (b) obviously (antonym); (c) prestige (synonym); (d) phenomenon (synonym); (e) unique (antonym); (f) belong (synonym); (g) outnumber (synonym); (h) monolingual (antonym); (i) native (antonym); (j) variety (synonym); (k) emerge (antonym); (l) control (antonym) (m) bewildering (synonym); (n) intelligibility (antonym).",

The next significant segment is study , which occupies 20 % of the day, signaling an ongoing effort to reinforce learning outside class. Leisurely activities like recreation take up 12 %, offering balance and downtime, while play accounts for a smaller 5 %, portraying more spontaneous or fun engagement. Finally, a modest 8 % is categorized under other —likely including tasks such as meals, personal care, commuting, or light chores. Overall, this distribution reflects a well-rounded daily schedule where academic responsibilities and rest dominate, yet there remains space for recreation, play, and miscellaneous activities that contribute to a holistic routine."

          "explanation": "Once, there was a selfish giant who had a large and beautiful garden. The garden was full of soft green grass. Here and there, all over the grass stood many colorful flowers like stars, each one radiant and unique in its own way. But despite the splendor of his garden, the giant kept it all to himself, allowing no one else to enjoy its beauty.\nAs the seasons passed, the giant's garden flourished, becoming even more breathtaking with each passing day. Yet, the giant remained aloof and selfish, unwilling to share the joy of his garden with anyone else.\nHowever, one winter, something extraordinary happened. A thick blanket of snow covered the ground, turning the garden into a dazzling winter wonderland. And within this icy landscape, something miraculous occurred—the giant's heart began to thaw.\nOne chilly morning, as the giant gazed out at his garden, he noticed something he had never seen before. In the corner of his eye, he caught sight of a small figure—a child—peeking through a gap in the garden wall, their face filled with wonder and longing.\nAt that moment, the giant felt a stirring within him, a newfound sense of compassion that he had long suppressed. With a sudden realization, he understood the true purpose of his garden—it was meant to be shared with others, to bring joy and happiness to all who beheld its beauty.\nFilled with a newfound sense of purpose, the giant approached the garden wall and, with a gentle smile, welcomed the child into his garden. From that day forth, the once selfish giant became known not for his greed, but for his generosity and kindness, as he opened his heart and his garden to all who sought its warmth and beauty. And in doing so, he discovered the true meaning of happiness—that it is found not in possessing, but in giving freely and sharing with others."
