          "explanation": "\n(a)\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines adolescence as the period of life between 10 and 19 years of age. This stage marks the transition from childhood to adulthood, characterized by significant physical, emotional, and social development. Adolescents experience rapid growth and undergo various changes that influence their health, behavior, and interactions with society.\n(b)\nAccording to the 2022 Bangladesh Census, the population of adolescents aged 10–14 is approximately 16.6 million, with 8.5 million boys and 7.8 million girls. For the 15–19 age group, there are about 16.5 million adolescents, comprising 8.1 million boys and 8.5 million girls. In total, adolescents make up about 28.8% of Bangladesh's population, with a near-equal distribution between boys and girls.\n(c)\nAdolescent girls in Bangladesh face several challenges\nChild Marriage : Approximately 51% of girls in Bangladesh are married before the age of 18, making it one of the highest rates globally.\nEducation : While enrollment rates for girls have improved, many still face barriers to completing secondary education, especially in rural areas.\nHealth Risks : Early pregnancies pose significant health risks, with many adolescent girls becoming mothers before reaching adulthood.\nViolence and Abuse : A significant number of adolescent girls experience physical or sexual violence, often within intimate relationships.\nThese issues hinder their development and access to opportunities, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.\n(d)\nIn Bangladesh, the legal age for marriage is 18 for girls and 21 for boys, as stipulated by the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 2017. However, the law includes provisions that allow for exceptions under certain circumstances, such as parental consent and court approval, which have been criticized for potentially undermining efforts to prevent child marriage.\n(e)\nWhile the legal age for marriage is 21 for boys in Bangladesh, readiness for marriage is influenced by various factors beyond age, including emotional maturity, financial stability, and societal expectations. Cultural norms often dictate that men should be established in their careers and capable of supporting a family before marriage. However, these expectations can vary widely across different communities and regions within the country."

(No. 1 has been done for you.)\nA peace movement is a social movement that seeks to achieve ideals such as the ending of a particular war (or all wars), minimize inter-human violence in a particular place or type of situation, including ban of guns, and is often linked to the goal of achieving world peace. Means to achieve these ends include advocacy of pacifism, non-violent resistance, diplomacy, boycotts, demonstrations, peace camps; supporting anti-war political candidates and banning guns, creating open government, direct democracy; supporting people who expose war-crimes or conspiracies to create wars, and making laws. Different organizations involved in peace movements may have some diverse goals, but one common goal is sustainability of peace.\nEnding of war →\n2→\n3→\n4→\n5→\n6",

          "explanation": "The Causes and Effects of Drug Addiction on the Individual, Family and Overall Society\nDrug is an essential element of human life. But abuse of drugs affects the nervous system (স্নায়ুতন্ত্র) of our body seriously. Drug addiction means a strong desire for a drug which the addict cannot resist. Narcotics like opium, morphine, heroin, marijuana, cocaine, etc. are used by the addicts. These drugs are used for their intoxicating ( উন্মাদক), tranquillizing and stimulating effects. If a person gets addicted to any of these once, he cannot go without it. Drug addiction is a curse of modern civilization. Drugs make youngsters go astray and destroy many valuable and beautiful lives. There are some reasons for drug addiction such as, frustration, bad association, availability of intoxicant, unemployment, failure in love, degradation of religious values, lack of family ties, etc. When a young person falls into a completely hopeless situation, drugs allure him. Sometimes young boys and girls come in contact with drugs out of curiosity. Drug addiction creates social problems. Narcotics (মাদকদ্রব্য) are very expensive. So. the addicted person often goes for stealing, hijacking and all sorts of misdeeds to procure money for buying drugs. He can, in no circumstances, refrain from taking drugs. He tries to have it at any cost. It helps him to see strange things that have no existence at all to him. The drug addict also does something that ruins the peace of the family. He even steals ornaments, utensils, clothes and what not to procure money for buying drugs. So, all other members of the family remain in tension for his misdeeds. The fate of the addict is pathetic. He dies a painful death losing character: He becomes a burden not only for the family but also for the society and also for the nation. The remedy for drug addiction is not very easy. Drug addiction is not only a national but also a global problem. To save our young generation from drug addiction, the government and educated people should come forward with necessary remedies. Strong measures should be taken to stop the production and trafficking (পাচার) of drugs. Drug business is punishable (শাস্তিযোগ্য) and the highest punishment is death sentence in Bangladesh. This law should be enforced immediately."

          "explanation": "The Privileged Should Extend Helping Hands to the Poor\nIt was a bright sunny morning. I was going to college with some of my friends. We were in a hilarious mood as we were talking about our plan to go on a picnic. Suddenly, we noticed an old woman who was begging money for his ailing son. It was hard for us to turn a blind eye. Her torn clothes and sad face brought tears to our eyes and we decided to help her. When we asked her about her son, she replied that her son was a garments worker and had been crippled due to an accident in the factory. The owner did not provide any compensation, and since then, she had to beg for buying foods and medicine for her son. All of us felt sorrow for the unfortunate woman and gave her the money we saved for the picnic. Then, we again started for the college while thanking the Almighty about our privileged lives.\nWe have our health, a roof over our head, foods on table and a million other blessings to count. It is the duty of the wealthy and the privileged section of the society to come forward to aid these unfortunate people."

          "explanation": "The pie chart displays the various sources of air pollution in a city, highlighting five key contributors. Vehicles are by far the most significant source, accounting for 60% of total air pollution. This indicates a heavy reliance on private and commercial transportation, possibly due to limited public transport infrastructure. Industry is the second-largest contributor at 18% , reflecting emissions from factories and manufacturing units. Power plants contribute 13% , suggesting that electricity generation—likely from fossil fuels—is another major pollutant. Waste disposal activities are responsible for 3% , while heating or using gas contributes nothing ( 0% ), showing negligible or highly controlled emissions in that category.\nThe disparity is stark: vehicles alone contribute more than all other sources combined, underscoring the urgent need for cleaner transport alternatives and stricter vehicular emission controls. In contrast, waste disposal and gas usage have a minimal impact, suggesting these are not major areas of concern. Targeted interventions in transport and industry could significantly improve air quality."
