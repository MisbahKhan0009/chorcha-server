(One is done for you).\nThe sea is the only thing that helps me dream. When I stand on the shore I can imagine Cyprus, travel to Paris, fly to Rome, all while standing in the same spot. I go around the whole world and in the end I land on my bed in our house, in the middle of the refugee camp. I go back to the reality of Gaza, the dirty market, overflowing sewage, the carts, and what's on top of the carts, the suffocating smell, and the silent people who can't speak. When I look at the clock and it's 11:55. I start shaking and my heart beats faster, I feel that the war started again. Not only the clock scares me - everything that flies does, even the flies. I can't tell anyone about my fear so they dori't call me a wimp or a sissy. I'm most scared for my older brothers. When a fly lands on any of them, I feel it's going to kill him, I start shouting and I run away from the place. That's why I'm now escaping outside the house all the time, because of the many flies.\n1. Dreaming of faraway places → 2 → 3 → 4 →5 → 6",

People were collecting the paper form the streets to use it for baking, because the electricity was disconnected. My mum didn't want to bake and she asked me to bring bread from the oven. The queue at the oven stretched from Gaza to the West Bank. People would line up for 8 hours to get to their turn and take half a pack of bread.\nIn seconds, a Palestinian rocket launcher was erected in the area and in less than one second the Israeli planes started bombing it. People began running in all directions and the ambulances came. People started falling dead... others were injured. I was in shock, and people in the street started telling me thank God you're safe. Anyway I went back home without the loaf of bread. And my mum yelled at me... but till today, she doesn't know why I didn't bring the bread.",

          "explanation": "Once, there lived a woodcutter. He was very poor but honest. He lived on the bank of a river near a jungle. He used to cut wood every day from the dense forest, selling it in the nearby village to make a meager living. Despite his hardships, he was content with his simple life and found joy in the beauty of nature surrounding him.\nOne day, while he was deep in the forest, he noticed something glimmering in the water. Curious, he approached the riverbank and discovered a beautiful golden axe submerged in the river. The woodcutter knew that this axe was not his, so he decided to leave it there. Suddenly, a fairy appeared before him, emerging from the water. She was impressed by his honesty and told him that she would reward him for his noble character.\nThe fairy asked the woodcutter if he wanted a new axe. He replied that he only needed a simple iron axe to continue his work. The fairy then gave him a sturdy, shining iron axe, and in return for his honesty, she granted him the ability to always find enough wood to sell and provide for his needs.\nFrom that day on, the woodcutter’s life changed for the better. He worked hard, but now he always had enough wood to sell and even started saving money. He was able to help others in his village, sharing his fortune with those less fortunate than himself.\nYears passed, and the woodcutter remained grateful for the fairy’s gift. He often visited the riverbank, where he first met her, to express his gratitude and remember the lesson of honesty and kindness. And so, the woodcutter lived happily, surrounded by the beauty of the forest and the friendship of his community."

          "explanation": "56 RK Mission Road, Cumilla\n5 June 2023\nDear Anik,\nI have been informed by Reza that being infected with COVID-19, you are now hospitalized in Dhaka. This information was just like a bolt from the blue to me. I did not expect it as I knew that, you had always been very careful and cautious about maintaining safe distance and wearing mask. Anyway, \"Prevention is better than cure\" does not always work. Sometimes, many unexpected (অপ্রত্যাশিত) things happen in our life and we must remain ready to face and fight them out. COVID-19 is now a pandemic (অতিমারী/বৈশ্বিক মহামারি); anybody may be infected with COVID-19 any time and anywhere. So, there is nothing to be worried. Many COVID-19 patients are being dehospitalized everyday after full recovery. Have patience and follow your doctor's advice. You are a conscious person and I am sure you will maintain your quarantine (সঙ্গনিরোধ) period properly. By the grace of the Almighty, you will come round very soon. Don't lose your mental strength. Courage and mental strength play a vital role to cure a COVID-19 patient. You know vaccination programme is going on across the world including our country. So, after getting fully recovered, don't make delay in getting vaccinated.\nWishing your earliest recovery.\nYour loving friend,\nSumon"
