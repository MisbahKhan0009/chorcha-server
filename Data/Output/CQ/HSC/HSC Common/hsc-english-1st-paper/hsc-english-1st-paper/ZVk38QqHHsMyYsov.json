          "explanation": "16 College Road, Jashore 10 March 2024\nDear Afia,\nI hope this letter finds you in good health. In your last letter, you wanted to know how we celebrate Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman's birthday in Bangladesh. Today I am writing to you about it. The Father of the Nation was born on March 17, 1920. We celebrate his birthday with great respect and honour. His birthday is a public holiday in our country. The Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina begins the day by placing wreaths at his grave in Tungipara. After that, a moment of silence is observed in memory of Bangabandhu. Additionally, Bangladesh Army, Navy and Air Force give a guard of honour. Schools, colleges and other institutions throughout the country celebrate the day with various programs and activities. Students and teachers participate in rallies and place wreaths at the portrait of Bangabandhu. Cultural programs, essay writing and drawing competitions, debates, discussions, etc. are arranged as well. On national television, old footage of\nBangabandhu is broadcast along with special documentaries dedicated to him. No more today. Write to me soon and tell me what you do on March 17th in your country.\nYour sister,\nSaima"

          "explanation": "\nOnce upon a time there lived a king in England. He had three daughters. One day he made up his mind to divide his kingdom among them. So, he called them in the court and asked each of them how much they loved him.\nGoneril, the eldest, stepped forward first. “Father, I love you more than all the diamonds and treasures of the world!” she exclaimed. The king beamed and gave her a generous portion of his realm.\nNext came Regan the second daughter. “Dear father,” she said, “my love for you shall never change—it is as deep as the sea and as constant as the stars.” Again, the king was pleased and granted her an equal share.\nFinally, his youngest and dearest daughter, Cordelia, came before him. With a gentle voice, she said, “Father, I love you as much as the salt upon our tables. Without it, food has no flavor—so life is dull without you.” Her honest words surprised the court.\nThe king’s face darkened. He thought, How ungrateful! He dramatically dismissed her: “Salt? Unfit! You shall receive nothing! Begone from this kingdom!”\nBanished, Cordelia wandered into the forest in tears. As fate would have it, a kind prince found her among the trees. Impressed by her purity and calm strength, he married her and brought her to his kingdom, while Cordelia never forgot her father.\nBack home, the king’s life grew tasteless—his meals had no joy, his lands were split, and his daughters, blinded by vanity, turned away. In his loneliness, he realized Cordelia’s words were wise: just as salt gives flavor to food, her simple truth brought life to his heart.\nFilled with regret, he sent messengers far and wide to beg her return. Cordelia returned at the head of her husband’s court, salt in hand, and lovingly reconciled with him. The king restored her share, reunited his heart, and lived his remaining days in peace and gratitude.\n"

          "explanation": "The graph shows the percentages of death caused by COVID-19 in respect of age distribution . In the graph, varying percentages of death by COVID-19 can be noticed according to different levels of age. As the graph shows, 3% death caused by COVID-19 was recorded for the people of the age group 10 or below 10; 8% for the people of the age group 11 to 20; 26% for the people of the age group 21 to 30; 24% for the people of the age group 41 to 50; 13% for the people of the age group 51 to 60; and 8% for the people of the age group above 60. The highest number of people who died by COVID-19 were of the age 21 to 30 while the lowest number of people who died by COVID-19 were of the age 10 or below. At the same time, the people of the age groups 31 d to 40 and 41 to 50 occupied the second and third highest percentages of death respectively. So, it is evident that the young people were at the highest risk of death. Contrarily, the children were safer than any other age group. Also, the adolescents and the old people were at lesser risk of death."

The dog lay close to him and found a comfort there that I did not have for him.... \"He stayed right with me,\" he told me, \"except when he ran in the laurel.... There was a place where the grass was high and I lay down in it and hid. I could hear Pat hunting for me.... When he found me he acted crazy, and he ran around and around me, in circles.\" We watched the flames. \"That's an apple log,\" he said. \"It burns the prettiest of any wood.\" We were very close. He was suddenly impelled to speak. \"You look a little bit like my mother,\" he said. \"Especially in the dark, by the fire.\" \"But you were only four, Jerry, when you came here. You have remembered how she looked, all these years?\" \"My mother lives in Mannville,\" he said. For a moment, finding that he had a mother shocked me... I did not know why it disturbed me. Then I understood my distress. I was filled with a passionate resentment that any woman should go away and leave her son. A son like this one The orphanage was a wholesome place, the food was more than adequate, the boys were healthy.... Granted, perhaps, that the boy felt no lack, what blood fed the bowels of a woman who did not yearn over this child's lean body that had come in parturition out of her own? \"Have you seen her, Jerry - lately?\" I asked. \"I see her every summer. She sends for me.\" I wanted to cry out. \"Why are you not with her? How can she let you go away again?\" He said, \"She comes up here from Mannville whenever she can. She doesn't have a job now.\" His face shone in the firelight. \"She wanted to give me a puppy, but they can't let any one boy keep a puppy. You remember the suit I had on last Sunday?\" He was plainly proud. \"She sent me that for Christmas. The Christmas before that\" - he drew a long breath, savoring the memory - \"she sent me a pair of skates.... I let the other boys use them, but they're careful of them.\"",

      "uddipok": "Write a summary of the following text.\nOnce upon a time, there was a strange man who was highly bothered to see others' happiness. In fact, he hated the courteous and polite people around him and thus he hated a few expressions like please, thank you, don't mention it etc. It troubled him a lot when people around were smiling to use these expressions.\nThe man considered all these expressions extravagant. So, he took a mission to invent a device that would steal these polite words. He calculated two benefits from his efforts. One, people won't use these words and thus he would be relieved of his apathy to people's polite behavior and the second one was earning money by selling the words stolen by the machine to somebody else. After a few months' hard work, he succeeded in inventing the machine he desired for a long long time. The machine started working and it gave the man complete satisfaction. People from their long practice would try to say thank you, so kind of you, my pleasure, don't mention it etc. as to appreciate others or express gratitude. But their tongue could not produce these words. The machine caught them. It resulted in a huge change in people's behaviour and attitudes. Gradually people became rough and tough, they lost their mental cool, they were blaming each other or fighting with each other. They became so selfish that they started refusing\nto help others without having a return for their service.\nThe man was terribly happy with his success, but he didn't count on two little girls of special needs. They had speech difficulty and so they used to communicate using sign language. Since the machine couldn't steal gestures, these girls continued their previous practices, of being kind and polite. Soon they realised the difference between them and other people, which led them to investigate the reason. After much toil, they could discover the wicked man, who was in a hide out on the top of a hill next to the sea with his enormous machine busy in capturing people's polite words and separating them into letters. The girls found the man taking a nap when they crept up to the machine and rewind it so that people could get back to their normal behaviour.\nAs a result, the machine exploded, scattering all the letters it had gathered into the sky. After some moments, the letters started coming down, like rain, and ended up in the sea. After that, everyone became polite and respectful to each other again. The anger and the arguments stopped, proving that good manners are very useful for keeping people together in a spirit of happiness.",
