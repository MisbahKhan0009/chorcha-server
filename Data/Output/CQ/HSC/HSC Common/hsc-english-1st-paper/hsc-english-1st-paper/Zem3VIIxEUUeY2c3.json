          "explanation": "Adulteration of Foodstuff: Causes and Consequences\nAdulteration of foodstuff refers to the practice of intentionally adding harmful, low-quality, or synthetic substances to food items in order to increase profits. It is a serious issue that affects public health and undermines consumer trust. Adulterated food is often cheaper to produce but can pose significant health risks to those who consume it unknowingly.\nCauses of Food Adulteration\nOne of the primary causes of food adulteration is the economic motive behind it. Sellers and manufacturers may use adulterants to increase the quantity or shelf life of food products, thereby reducing costs. For example, low-quality or artificial substances are often added to increase the weight of spices, grains, or beverages. This is especially common in the case of products like milk, tea, sugar, and edible oils.\nThe lack of stringent regulations and enforcement also contributes to the prevalence of food adulteration. In many countries, food safety laws are not strictly implemented, allowing unscrupulous traders to exploit gaps in the system. In some cases, poor awareness among consumers about food safety and quality standards makes it easier for adulterated food to enter the market without detection.\nAnother significant cause is the greed of certain manufacturers and traders. In their quest for higher profits, they compromise on quality and safety. For instance, chemicals, artificial colorants, and preservatives are added to food items like fruits, vegetables, and sweets to make them look fresh and appealing, despite the potential health risks they pose.\nConsequences of Food Adulteration\nThe consequences of food adulteration are severe and can have both short-term and long-term effects on health. Immediate reactions to consuming adulterated food can include food poisoning, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which can be particularly dangerous for children and the elderly.\nLong-term consumption of adulterated food can lead to chronic health problems, such as liver and kidney damage, cancer, and reproductive issues. For instance, the addition of harmful chemicals like formalin in fish or milk can lead to severe health complications over time. The accumulation of toxic substances in the body can weaken the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to diseases.\nIn addition to health risks, food adulteration also leads to economic losses for consumers. People pay for food products that are often less nutritious or potentially harmful. This can cause financial strain, especially in lower-income communities where access to safe food is already limited.\nMoreover, food adulteration damages the reputation of businesses and industries that rely on consumer trust. Once a brand is associated with adulterated food, it can lose its customers and face legal consequences, leading to long-term financial losses.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, food adulteration is a harmful practice with far-reaching consequences. The causes are multifaceted, including economic motives, lack of regulation, and consumer ignorance. The effects on health and the economy are undeniable, making it imperative for governments to enforce strict food safety regulations and for consumers to remain vigilant. Only through collective efforts can we ensure that the food we consume is safe, nutritious, and free from harmful adulterants."

          "explanation": "\nIt was a hot summer day. There was scorching heat of the sun.  A crow became very thirsty. It wanted to drink water but there was no water around it. So, it began to fly but did not find any source of water anywhere.\n\n\nThe crow was very hopeful and patience. It was clever too. So, it did not lose heart and kept on flying. At last it found a jar in a garden. It became very pleased. It flew down and sat on the jar. But alas! There was a little water at the bottom of the jar and it was out of its reach. Hence, it tried to turn the jar over again and again but brought no result. After several efforts, the crow got tired and disappointed. In despair when it was about to leave the place, it noticed a heap of pebbles nearby. It got hope and hit upon a plan. The crow picked up some pebbles and started dropping into the jar one after another. As a result, the water of the jar rose up little by little. When the water came to the brim of the jar, the crow drank its heart content and flew away.\n\n\nIn this way, the strong will of the crow helped it to meet its thirst.\n"

          "explanation": "Feni\n04.07.2024\nDear Mijanur,\nHey! How are things going at college? I'm writing to you today because I wanted to talk about something important – reading newspapers.\nI know you might not be a big fan of sitting down with a physical paper these days, but trust me, there are a lot of benefits to be had from this \"old-fashioned\" habit.\nFirstly, newspapers keep you informed. They give you a well-rounded view of current events, both locally and internationally. It's important to stay up-to-date on what's happening in the world, not just through social media, which can be filled with rumors and biased opinions. Newspapers offer a more reliable source of information.\nSecondly, reading newspapers improves your vocabulary and communication skills. They're full of rich, descriptive language, and you'll be exposed to new words and writing styles. This can definitely help you improve your own writing and speaking abilities.\nThirdly, newspapers challenge your mind and keep it sharp. Reading articles on various topics, from politics and science to sports and entertainment, engages your brain in a different way. It's a good mental exercise and helps you stay mentally stimulated.\nFinally, newspapers can even introduce you to new interests. You might stumble upon an article about something you never knew existed, sparking a new passion or hobby.\nI know you're busy with classes and other activities, but even just skimming through the headlines or reading a few articles a day can make a big difference. Maybe there's a section you'd find particularly interesting, like sports or technology? You could even consider subscribing to a digital version of a newspaper for easier access.\nGive it a try, [Brother's Name]! I think you might be surprised at how much you learn and enjoy it.\nLet me know what you think if you decide to check it out.\nBest,\nHarun"

          "explanation": "The bar graph illustrates the steady increase in the number of internet users in Bangladesh from 2014 to 2019. The graph shows that in 2014, there were around 40 million users, which increased to approximately 60 million by 2015. Then, the number of users suddenly decreased and reached 50 million in 2016. Only this particular year marks a decrease in the number of users. Then, a significant surge occurred in 2017 and the number of internet users jumped to 70 million. This marks an increase highlighting a rapid growth in internet accessibility and usage. The number of users remained same in 2018. Finally, in 2019, the number of internet users took another jump and turned into 80 million in total. Analysing the graph, we find that within five years, the number of internet users in Bangladesh increased significantly, making it double. It is a clear indication that during this period, the country's digital infrastructure improved significantly. It also shows that people of Bangladesh are. getting accustomed to the modern technologies."

          "explanation": "\n(a)\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines adolescence as the period of life between 10 and 19 years of age. This stage marks the transition from childhood to adulthood, characterized by significant physical, emotional, and social development. Adolescents experience rapid growth and undergo various changes that influence their health, behavior, and interactions with society.\n(b)\nAccording to the 2022 Bangladesh Census, the population of adolescents aged 10–14 is approximately 16.6 million, with 8.5 million boys and 7.8 million girls. For the 15–19 age group, there are about 16.5 million adolescents, comprising 8.1 million boys and 8.5 million girls. In total, adolescents make up about 28.8% of Bangladesh's population, with a near-equal distribution between boys and girls.\n(c)\nAdolescent girls in Bangladesh face several challenges\nChild Marriage : Approximately 51% of girls in Bangladesh are married before the age of 18, making it one of the highest rates globally.\nEducation : While enrollment rates for girls have improved, many still face barriers to completing secondary education, especially in rural areas.\nHealth Risks : Early pregnancies pose significant health risks, with many adolescent girls becoming mothers before reaching adulthood.\nViolence and Abuse : A significant number of adolescent girls experience physical or sexual violence, often within intimate relationships.\nThese issues hinder their development and access to opportunities, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.\n(d)\nIn Bangladesh, the legal age for marriage is 18 for girls and 21 for boys, as stipulated by the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 2017. However, the law includes provisions that allow for exceptions under certain circumstances, such as parental consent and court approval, which have been criticized for potentially undermining efforts to prevent child marriage.\n(e)\nWhile the legal age for marriage is 21 for boys in Bangladesh, readiness for marriage is influenced by various factors beyond age, including emotional maturity, financial stability, and societal expectations. Cultural norms often dictate that men should be established in their careers and capable of supporting a family before marriage. However, these expectations can vary widely across different communities and regions within the country."

These songs are also about social inequality and poverty, about the material world and the supernatural. Mystical songs have been composed using the metaphors of rivers and boats. Since the country is basically riverine, the Bhatiyali forms an important genre of folk music. Nature plays a role in providing the content and rhythm of folk music. The folk music of Bangladesh varies from region to region, reflecting changes in the natural environment and the dialects people use. Thus there are the northern Bhawaiya, the eastern Bhatiyali and the southwestern Baul songs.\nSongs reflecting rural and riverine life→\n2→\n3→\n4→\n5→\n6",

The word is increasingly used for such people as a collective group or a community. The world has seen many diasporas but scholars have been studying the phenomenon with great interest only in recent decades. Among the great diasporas of history is that of the Jewish people, who were forced to leave their lands in ancient times. The movement of Aryans from Central Europe to the Indian sub-continent thousands of years ago is also noteworthy diaspora, although the causes of this diaspora is unclear. In twentieth century history, the Palestinian diaspora has attracted a lot of attention and been a cause of concern for world leaders because of the plight of Palestinians. There have been massive diasporas in Africa, too, over the centuries, either because of war or because of the ravages of nature. But the chief reason why the phenomenon of diaspora is attracting so much attention now is globalization",
