We buy foods, clothes or everyday essentials, pay for different services, entertain people, travel to places, help others in need or invest in business and thus spend money every day. In fact, spending is a part of our life.\nSpending may make us happy or unhappy depending on how and why we spend. When we spend money on things that we need and within our limit, it is good. When it becomes a compulsive behaviour, it makes life stressful. Unnecessary spending or spending beyond one's means has some bad effects. For one thing, it may lead to financial ruin or debt, and for another,. it may create unhappiness within families. People who overspend are never satisfied with what they have. They always rush for brands, fashion items, designer clothes, etc. Over a period of time, it becomes an addiction which may eventually create psychological problems.\nNowadays, consumer items are displayed in stores or in advertisements in ways that they create a feeling of immediate need for them. We are constantly tempted to buy, use or consume things even when we do not have a genuine need. We all need to be careful here. Salespersons often encourage customers to buy things by flattering them. 'This is a perfect match for you,' they would say. or 'You look so stunning in that dress.' Never forget, they say the same thing to most of their customers. It is better not to be persuaded by such words. They use these words to please the customers as the more a customer buys, the higher the profit is. Overspending is not only related to shopping, it applies to other activities as well such as eating out. Many people buy too many items to eat in a restaurant. They can eat only some of them and the rest are wasted: It's not a responsible attitude. We cannot simply waste food because we have money to buy it.\nYoung people in a shopping mall often look at an item on display afd think 'Oh I must buy this. I really need this.' They may not have the money needed. In their wallet. So, they use credit cards but using them is like taking a loan. If they are not careful, the loans increase which might lead them to a debt-trap.\nSometimes children insist on buying things that their parents cannot pay without stretching their budget. This may happen because the children's friends also have them. It's not fair as it becomes a burden for the parents.\nFinally, don't get trapped by the glossy advertisements on television or the Internet. You should rather ask yourself: \"Do I need this?\" The best way to control the habit of spending is not to think 'What I need', but 'Can I do without it?'",

          "explanation": "Money is spent every day for various reasons. Necessary expenses within our limit may make us happy. But unnecessary expenditure or spending money beyond our ability creates some problems and may lead to psychological problems. At present, consumer items are exhibited and advertised so attractively that we want to buy them immediately even without having a genuine need. Salespersons often flatter the customers to encourage them to buy more things. Buying more foods than requirements and their wastage means wastage of money. Children also make their parents fall in economic crisis by pressurizing them to buy unnecessary things. We should restrain this habit of overspending by asking ourselves if we can do without the thing we feel tempted to buy."

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following text.\n\"The Negro is still not free. The life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. The Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. The Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. So, we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.... I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal. I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of 'interposition' and 'nullification', that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.\"",

          "explanation": "The text is part of a speech about the racial discrimination prevailing in the American society against the Negro.' Here the speaker says that Black people are still not free because of unfair treatment. They live in poverty while others are rich. The Black feel like strangers in their own country. Even with these struggles, the speaker has a dream. He dreams that one day, everyone will be treated as equals. He hopes that former slaves' children and former slave owners' children will live peacefully together. He dreams that every state will become fair and that  his children will be judged by their character, not by their skin color. He also hopes that black and white  children in Alabama will become friends."

          "explanation": "The poem underscores the importance of holding or fostering a dream since life without dream is meaningless and it loses its true purpose. The poet compares such dreamless life with a 'broken-winged bird', which is unable to fly to reach its destination. In addition, the poet compares a life void of dream with a 'barren field' which is covered with frozen snow. Indeed, we must cherish a dream to be súccessful in life."

          "explanation": "The bar chart shows information about the monthly average temperature of a year in Bangladesh. From the graph, it can be clearly seen that it looks like a pyramid. June and July, the middle part of the year, is the hottest period. During these two months, the average temperature is 35 degrees. Then the temperature gradually goes down in both ends towards the beginning or the end of the year. The average temperatures in January and February are 10 degrees and 20 degrees respectively. 30 degrees is the average temperature that prevails during March and April respectively, and in May the temperature slightly goes up to 33 degrees. August and September experience the temperature of 33 degrees again. Then it gradually goes down 30 degrees in October, 28 degrees in November and 15 degrees in December. So, we can conclude that the temparature of Bangladesh\nfluctuates all the year round."

The scholar was gossiping with the boatman. \"Do you have any knowledge about the creation of the universe?\" the scholar asked. \"No,\" the boatman replied. The scholar got astonished and said,\"Without the knowledge of astronomy, half of your life is spoilt.\" The boatman became sad and thought of the uselessness of his life. The scholar again asked the boatman, \"Do you know the history of human civilization?\" The boatman replied the same. This time, the scholar told the boatman that he had already spoilt three-fourths of his life and he could not come to any use to the society. The boatman remained silent and kept on rowing the boat in a sad mood. Suddenly, the weather became gusty. The sky sky became overcast with black clouds. There was darkness all around. Then, it started to rain heavily with lightening. The boat was about to capsize. The scholar was trembling with fear. The boatman asked the scholar, \"Sir, do you know how to swim?\" Hearing the question, the scholar started to cry and replied in negative. Now, the boatman said, \"Alas! Your life is totally spoilt. Pray to God for your safety.\""

Recently I have visited the Ekushey Boi Mela. Now, I am going to tell you about it.\nI went to Ekushey Boi Mela held at Bangla Academy premises on the occasion of 21 st February. About two hundred stalls were there. All sorts of books such as fictions, novels, dramas, poems and books of medicine, engineering. politics, history, general knowledge, etc, were brought for display and sale in Ekushey Boi Mela. The book fair became crowdy specially in the evening. Both male and female customers gathered ( জড়ো হওয়া ) in Ekushey Boi Mela. Many writers also visited the fair. When I bought a novel from a stall, I noticed a big gathering in front of a particular stall which was for the writers. I went there and saw that Imdadul Haq Milan, a famous novelist, was present there and was giving autographs to the people over there. I also became interested in having his autograph but due to long line of people, I checked my wish. Afterwards, I enjoyed a cultural function. In fact, I enjoyed a lot visiting the Ekushey Boi Mela.\nNo more today. With much love.\nYours ever,\nEnum"
