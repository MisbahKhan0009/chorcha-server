It has numerous rivers,\n                                  canals, beels, lakes, and vast areas of floodplains. Hakaluki haor is one of the major\n                                  wetlands of Bangladesh. With a land area of 18,386 hectares, it supports a rich\n                                  biodiversity and provides direct and indirect livelihood benefits to nearly 1,90,000\n                                  people. This haor was declared an Ecologically Critical Area in April 1999 by the\n                                  government of Bangladesh. Hakaluki is a complex ecosystem, containing more than 238\n                                  interconnecting beels and jalmahals. The haor falls under two administrative\n                                  districts, Maulvibazar and Sylhet. Some 1,90,000 people live in the area surrounding\n                                  the haor.\nHakaluki haor is an important source of fisheries resources for Bangladesh. Kalibaus,\n                                  Boal, Rui, Ghagot, Pabda, and Chapila are the main fish species found here. From the\n                                  Kushiara, there are frequent upstream movements of fish towards the beels and\n                                  tributaries of Hakaluki. The beels in Hakaluki haor provide winter shelter for the\n                                  mother fisheries. In early monsoon, these mother fisheries produce millions of fries\n                                  for the entire downstream fishing communities. Floodplains are also an important\n                                  source of fisheries resources within the area. However, many of the beels have lost\n                                  their capacity to provide shelter for mother fisheries because of sand deposits from\n                                  upstream rivers and canals, use of complete dewatering technique for fishing and lack\n                                  of aquatic plants to provide feed and shelter for parents fish.",

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following text.\nMany adolescents face pressure to use alcohol, cigarettes, or other drugs and to\n                                  initiate sexual relationships putting\nthemselves at high risk for intentional and unintentłonal injuries, unintended\n                                  pregnancies, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including the human\n                                  immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Many also experience a wide range of adjustment and\n                                  mental health problems. Behaviour patterns that are established during this period\n                                  such as the use or avoidance of drugs and taking or abstaining from sexual risk can\n                                  have long-lasting negative and positive effects on future health and well-being. As a\n                                  result, adults have unique opportunities to influence adolescents. Adolescents are\n                                  different both from young children and adults. Specifically, adolescents are not fully\n                                  capable of understanding complex concepts, or the relationship between behaviour and\n                                  consequences, or the degree of control they have or can have over health\n                                  decision-making, including that related to sexual behaviour. This inability may make\n                                  them particularly vulnerable to sexual exploitation and high-risk behaviours. Laws,\n                                  customs, and practices may also affect adolescents differently than adults. For\n                                  example, laws and policies often restrict adolescents' access to reproductive health\n                                  information and services, especially when they are unmarried. In addition, even when\n                                  services do exist, provider attitudes about adolescents often pose a significant\n                                  barrier to the use of those services.",

This phase is so critical since\n                                    he/she has to face difficulties to adjust with them. They face life-destructing\n                                    pressures and a wide range of mental and health problems. Also, this period is the\n                                    shaper of his/her future with negative or positive effects. Adolescents are unable\n                                    to perceive the complex concepts of life. Therefore, they become very vulnerable to\n                                    high-risk behaviours and sexual exploitation. There are some restrictions and laws\n                                    imposed on them to control or prevent them from going astray. As this phase is so\n                                    critical for them, adults and other concerned authorities should be aware to guide\n                                    them in the right direction."

Among these, Facebook stands out as one of the most\n                                    prominent and influential platforms, especially among the young generation. However,\n                                    the impact of Facebook on today's youth is a subject of ongoing debate, with both\n                                    positive and negative effects being observed.\nPositive Influence:\nFacebook has undoubtedly revolutionized the way young people communicate, connect,\n                                    and share information. It serves as a virtual social hub, enabling users to stay\n                                    connected with friends and family, regardless of geographical distances. Through\n                                    Facebook, young individuals can maintain relationships, share updates about their\n                                    lives, and express themselves creatively through photos, videos, and posts.\nMoreover, Facebook facilitates networking and provides opportunities for\n                                    socialization. Many young people use Facebook to join groups and communities based\n                                    on shared interests, hobbies, or causes. These online communities offer a sense of\n                                    belonging and camaraderie, fostering friendships and collaborations that transcend\n                                    physical boundaries.\nAdditionally, Facebook has emerged as a powerful platform for learning and\n                                    awareness. It provides access to a vast repository of information, news, and\n                                    educational resources. Young users can engage with informative content, participate\n                                    in discussions, and broaden their perspectives on various issues.\nNegative Influence:\nDespite its many benefits, Facebook also exerts several negative influences on the\n                                    young generation. One of the primary concerns is the impact on mental health.\n                                    Excessive use of Facebook has been linked to feelings of loneliness, depression, and\n                                    anxiety among young users. The constant exposure to curated versions of others'\n                                    lives on social media can lead to unrealistic comparisons and feelings of\n                                    inadequacy.\nFurthermore, Facebook can be a breeding ground for cyberbullying and online\n                                    harassment. Young people may face peer pressure, criticism, or harassment from their\n                                    peers, which can have detrimental effects on their self-esteem and well-being.\nAnother significant issue associated with Facebook is its potential for addiction.\n                                    The platform's addictive features, such as likes, comments, and notifications, can\n                                    lead to compulsive usage patterns, detracting from real-world interactions and\n                                    productivity.\nMoreover, concerns have been raised about the impact of Facebook on privacy and data\n                                    security. Young users may unknowingly expose personal information or fall victim to\n                                    online scams and phishing attacks, posing risks to their safety and security.\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, Facebook wields a profound influence on the young generation, shaping\n                                    their social interactions, behaviors, and perceptions. While it offers numerous\n                                    benefits in terms of connectivity, information sharing, and community building, it\n                                    also poses challenges related to mental health, privacy, and online safety.\n                                    Therefore, it is imperative for young users, parents, educators, and policymakers to\n                                    recognize the dual nature of Facebook's impact and work towards promoting\n                                    responsible and mindful usage of social media platforms."

She felt grateful to be safe at home with\n                                    her loved ones and vowed to do her part in preventing the spread of the virus by\n                                    staying at home and following the guidelines set by the government."

It suggests that\n                                    while most people dream during the night, their dreams are often futile or\n                                    meaningless. However, those who dream during the day are more likely to turn their\n                                    dreams into reality. These dreamers are considered dangerous because of their\n                                    ability to make their visions a tangible part of their lives."
