          "question": "",
          "explanation": "\n(a)\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines adolescence as the period of life between 10 and 19 years of age. This stage marks the transition from childhood to adulthood, characterized by significant physical, emotional, and social development. Adolescents experience rapid growth and undergo various changes that influence their health, behavior, and interactions with society.\n(b)\nAccording to the 2022 Bangladesh Census, the population of adolescents aged 10–14 is approximately 16.6 million, with 8.5 million boys and 7.8 million girls. For the 15–19 age group, there are about 16.5 million adolescents, comprising 8.1 million boys and 8.5 million girls. In total, adolescents make up about 28.8% of Bangladesh's population, with a near-equal distribution between boys and girls.\n(c)\nAdolescent girls in Bangladesh face several challenges\nChild Marriage : Approximately 51% of girls in Bangladesh are married before the age of 18, making it one of the highest rates globally.\nEducation : While enrollment rates for girls have improved, many still face barriers to completing secondary education, especially in rural areas.\nHealth Risks : Early pregnancies pose significant health risks, with many adolescent girls becoming mothers before reaching adulthood.\nViolence and Abuse : A significant number of adolescent girls experience physical or sexual violence, often within intimate relationships.\nThese issues hinder their development and access to opportunities, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.\n(d)\nIn Bangladesh, the legal age for marriage is 18 for girls and 21 for boys, as stipulated by the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 2017. However, the law includes provisions that allow for exceptions under certain circumstances, such as parental consent and court approval, which have been criticized for potentially undermining efforts to prevent child marriage.\n(e)\nWhile the legal age for marriage is 21 for boys in Bangladesh, readiness for marriage is influenced by various factors beyond age, including emotional maturity, financial stability, and societal expectations. Cultural norms often dictate that men should be established in their careers and capable of supporting a family before marriage. However, these expectations can vary widely across different communities and regions within the country."

He formally left public life in June 2004 before his 86th birthday. But he remained one of the world's most revered public figures, combining celebrity sparkle with an unwavering message of freedom, respect and human rights.\nThe years Mandela spent behind bars made him the world's most celebrated political prisoner and a leader of mythic stature for millions of black South Africans and other oppressed people far beyond his country's borders. Charged with capital offences in the 1963 Rivonia Trial, his statement from the dock was his political testimony. \"During my lifetime I have fought against white domination and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities,\" he told the court. Friends adored Mandela. And people lauded his humanity, kindness and dignity\n1. An advocate of human dignity\n→ 2. → 3. → 4. → 5. → 6.",

      "uddipok": "Write a summary of the following passage:\nConflict can be defined in many ways but one of the simplest is that it pertains to the opposing ideas and actions of different entities, resulting in an antagonistic state. Conflict is an inevitable part of life. All of us possess our own opinions, ideas and sets of beliefs. We have our own ways of looking at things and we act according to what we think is proper. Hence, we often find ourselves in conflict in different scenarios; it may involve other individuals, groups of people or a struggle within our own selves. Consequently, conflict influences our actions and decisions in one way or another.\nConflict comes naturally; the clashing of thoughts and ideas is a part of the human experience. It is true that it can be destructive if left uncontrolled. However, it shouldn't be seen as something that can only cause negative things to transpire. It is a way to come up with more meaningful realizations that can certainly be helpful to the individuals involved.",

It is part and parcel of Bengali culture and tradition (ঐতিহ্য). So, the day is observed with traditional festivity (উল্লাস) across the country. People in villages celebrate this day as per their agelong customs. Special meals are arranged at home and Boishakhi Melas are held in different places. It is a day of great pleasure to the village people and children. City dwellers (নগরবাসী) also celebrate this day with delight. Girls and women put on yellow saris and boys put on pajamapanjabi. Some people eat watered-rice with onion, green chilli and hilsha fish. Shopkeepers in both towns and villages open new accounts books (হালখাতা) and offer sweets to their customers and this is the most impressive part of the celebration. Different cultural organizations offer different programmes. The celebration of Pahela Boishakh bears a great importance for us. It is passed by holding and enjoying festive programmes and functions. People living in Dhaka attend the Gano Sangeeter Ashor at Ramna Batamul in the morning. We reap great benefits from this kind of festival. It makes us stick to our traditional native culture. At the same time, it strengthens national unity making us forget the differences of religion, colour, race, etc. On this day, we get inspired to forget all the sorrows and failures (ব্যর্থতা) of the past year and to start a new life. with new vigour (বলিষ্ঠতা) and inspiration."

          "explanation": "The pie chart displays the various sources of air pollution in a city, highlighting five key contributors. Vehicles are by far the most significant source, accounting for 60% of total air pollution. This indicates a heavy reliance on private and commercial transportation, possibly due to limited public transport infrastructure. Industry is the second-largest contributor at 18% , reflecting emissions from factories and manufacturing units. Power plants contribute 13% , suggesting that electricity generation—likely from fossil fuels—is another major pollutant. Waste disposal activities are responsible for 3% , while heating or using gas contributes nothing ( 0% ), showing negligible or highly controlled emissions in that category.\nThe disparity is stark: vehicles alone contribute more than all other sources combined, underscoring the urgent need for cleaner transport alternatives and stricter vehicular emission controls. In contrast, waste disposal and gas usage have a minimal impact, suggesting these are not major areas of concern. Targeted interventions in transport and industry could significantly improve air quality."
