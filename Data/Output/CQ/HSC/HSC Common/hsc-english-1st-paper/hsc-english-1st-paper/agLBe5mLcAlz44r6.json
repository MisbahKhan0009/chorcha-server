          "explanation": "The bar graph illustrates the steady increase in the number of internet users in Bangladesh from 2014 to 2019. The graph shows that in 2014, there were around 40 million users, which increased to approximately 60 million by 2015. Then, the number of users suddenly decreased and reached 50 million in 2016. Only this particular year marks a decrease in the number of users. Then, a significant surge occurred in 2017 and the number of internet users jumped to 70 million. This marks an increase highlighting a rapid growth in internet accessibility and usage. The number of users remained same in 2018. Finally, in 2019, the number of internet users took another jump and turned into 80 million in total. Analysing the graph, we find that within five years, the number of internet users in Bangladesh increased significantly, making it double. It is a clear indication that during this period, the country's digital infrastructure improved significantly. It also shows that people of Bangladesh are. getting accustomed to the modern technologies."

So, Nova works hard to support her family. But it is not easy for a teenage girl to find a suitable job with no prior experience. For a while, she desperately searches for a stable job until she remembers an old hobby. One of her neighbors once taught her to sew and it quickly turned into a hobby. She has even sewn a few of her dresses herself. With her skill, she finds a job at the local tailor shop in no time. Although she earns a very little money from her job, she finds a great joy in stitching dresses for others. All of her customers seem to be very delighted by her work as well, which encouraged Nova to continue on the path passionately. Seeing Nova work hard every day to make ends meet, her husband finds the motivation to find a job for himself and contribute some money to share the struggle. A few years later, they are able to rent a small store in which Nova decides to open a new tailor shop. Everyone now knows it by the name \"Nova's Tailor Shop,\" but to Nova, it is her hardship and determination."

It is quite concerning that you are passing a stressful time because of your exams and others. In today's letter, I want to write to you about meditation.\nAt times, we can get overwhelmed with the thoughts in our head. I understand, it can be painful as it hinders our daily activities and you may fail to study attentively. Meditation is free of cost and is effective in reducing these troubles. Since time management is very important to students, let me assure you that meditation will not take much of your time. You can do it while you're on your study desk, on the bus returning home or even during your lunch break. Just close your eyes and focus on your breathing. If you want, you may follow a guided medication. But whichever techniques you find best, it will help you calm your mind and arrange your thoughts.\nMoreover, it will improve your concentration and thinking ability!\nNo more today. Write to me soon about your health and give my warm regards to your parents.\nYours ever,\nMadhuri"

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following passage.\nWe spend money for different reasons. We buy foods, clothes or everyday essentials, pay for different services, entertain people, travel to places, help others in need or invest in business and thus spend money every day. In fact, spending is a part of our life.\nSpending may make us happy or unhappy depending on how and why we spend. When we spend money on things that we need and within our limit, it is good. When it becomes a compulsive behaviour, it makes life stressful. Unnecessary spending or spending beyond one's means has some bad effects. For one thing, it may lead to financial ruin or debt, and for another,. it may create unhappiness within families. People who overspend are never satisfied with what they have. They always rush for brands, fashion items, designer clothes, etc. Over a period of time, it becomes an addiction which may eventually create psychological problems.\nNowadays, consumer items are displayed in stores or in advertisements in ways that they create a feeling of immediate need for them. We are constantly tempted to buy, use or consume things even when we do not have a genuine need. We all need to be careful here. Salespersons often encourage customers to buy things by flattering them. 'This is a perfect match for you,' they would say. or 'You look so stunning in that dress.' Never forget, they say the same thing to most of their customers. It is better not to be persuaded by such words. They use these words to please the customers as the more a customer buys, the higher the profit is. Overspending is not only related to shopping, it applies to other activities as well such as eating out. Many people buy too many items to eat in a restaurant. They can eat only some of them and the rest are wasted: It's not a responsible attitude. We cannot simply waste food because we have money to buy it.\nYoung people in a shopping mall often look at an item on display afd think 'Oh I must buy this. I really need this.' They may not have the money needed. In their wallet. So, they use credit cards but using them is like taking a loan. If they are not careful, the loans increase which might lead them to a debt-trap.\nSometimes children insist on buying things that their parents cannot pay without stretching their budget. This may happen because the children's friends also have them. It's not fair as it becomes a burden for the parents.\nFinally, don't get trapped by the glossy advertisements on television or the Internet. You should rather ask yourself: \"Do I need this?\" The best way to control the habit of spending is not to think 'What I need', but 'Can I do without it?'",

          "explanation": "Money is spent every day for various reasons. Necessary expenses within our limit may make us happy. But unnecessary expenditure or spending money beyond our ability creates some problems and may lead to psychological problems. At present, consumer items are exhibited and advertised so attractively that we want to buy them immediately even without having a genuine need. Salespersons often flatter the customers to encourage them to buy more things. Buying more foods than requirements and their wastage means wastage of money. Children also make their parents fall in economic crisis by pressurizing them to buy unnecessary things. We should restrain this habit of overspending by asking ourselves if we can do without the thing we feel tempted to buy."

The only thought which kept me worried, was that I must make it and that I must get good weather all the way. The second half of the swim is always very difficult. And if even little waves develop, it saps the ebbing energy of the swimmer all the more. Taking a lesson from my previous swims I kept my speed at a steady pace for I knew I would need every ounce of my energy towards the close. I felt hungry and famished and shouted for my manager. In reply, I was told that I could not afford to waste 10 minutes in having the feed! If I have to break the record, I must swim on with all my might. But I refused. I am sorry now for it. For if I had gone on. I might have finished the whole swim in less than 10 hours and 15 minutes creating a new world record from both sides…………",
