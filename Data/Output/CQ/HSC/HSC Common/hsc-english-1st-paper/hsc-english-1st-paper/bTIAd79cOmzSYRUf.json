          "explanation": "\n(a)\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines adolescence as the period of life between 10 and 19 years of age. This stage marks the transition from childhood to adulthood, characterized by significant physical, emotional, and social development. Adolescents experience rapid growth and undergo various changes that influence their health, behavior, and interactions with society.\n(b)\nAccording to the 2022 Bangladesh Census, the population of adolescents aged 10–14 is approximately 16.6 million, with 8.5 million boys and 7.8 million girls. For the 15–19 age group, there are about 16.5 million adolescents, comprising 8.1 million boys and 8.5 million girls. In total, adolescents make up about 28.8% of Bangladesh's population, with a near-equal distribution between boys and girls.\n(c)\nAdolescent girls in Bangladesh face several challenges\nChild Marriage : Approximately 51% of girls in Bangladesh are married before the age of 18, making it one of the highest rates globally.\nEducation : While enrollment rates for girls have improved, many still face barriers to completing secondary education, especially in rural areas.\nHealth Risks : Early pregnancies pose significant health risks, with many adolescent girls becoming mothers before reaching adulthood.\nViolence and Abuse : A significant number of adolescent girls experience physical or sexual violence, often within intimate relationships.\nThese issues hinder their development and access to opportunities, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.\n(d)\nIn Bangladesh, the legal age for marriage is 18 for girls and 21 for boys, as stipulated by the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 2017. However, the law includes provisions that allow for exceptions under certain circumstances, such as parental consent and court approval, which have been criticized for potentially undermining efforts to prevent child marriage.\n(e)\nWhile the legal age for marriage is 21 for boys in Bangladesh, readiness for marriage is influenced by various factors beyond age, including emotional maturity, financial stability, and societal expectations. Cultural norms often dictate that men should be established in their careers and capable of supporting a family before marriage. However, these expectations can vary widely across different communities and regions within the country."

      "uddipok": "Adolescents constitute a nation's core resource for national renewal and growth. Adolescence is a period in life when transition from childhood to adulthood takes place and behaviours and lifestyles are shaped. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), adolescence is the period which shapes the future of girls' and boys' lives. There are 28 million adolescents in Bangladesh; 13.7 million of them are girls and 14.3 million boys.\nThe situation of adolescent girls in Bangladesh is characterized by inequality and subordination within the family and society. This inequality leads to a widespread practice of child marriage, marginalization or exclusion from health, education and economic opportunities, and a vulnerability to violence and sexual abuse. In Bangladesh, the legal age of marriage is 18 for girls and 21 for boys. However, 33 percent of adolescent girls are married before the age of 15 and 60 percent. become mothers by the age of 19. Research finds that adolescents with higher level of education and from more 'affluent families tend to marry at a later age. Boys, however, become ready for marriage only after several years of adolescence and young adulthood.\nRead the above passage again and then write the antonyms or synonyms of the words as directed below:\n(a) core (synonym) (b) style (synonym) (c) violence (synonym) (d) inequality (antonym) (e) constitute (synonym) (f) abuse (antonym) (g) legal (synonym) (h) affluent (antonym) (i) wide spread (synonym) (j) growth (antonym).",

Every year we observe this day in a colorful manner. This day reminds us of the supreme in a colorful manner. This day reminds us of the supreme sacrifice of our freedom fighters who will ever shine in our hearts like the luminous stars in the sky. But at the same time we must remember the spirit of the liberation war. We wanted a country where justice will prevail over injustice and wrong. Instead , we are now having a night-marish experience of lawlessness, violence and misrule. The lords of the mischief mongers are getting upper hand in the society, whereas the meek and mild become the worst sufferers. Disorder  in everything has become the order of the day. Every year the Government, different organization and institutions take elaborate programmes to celebrate the day on a befitting manner. The national flag is hosted in all important offices, buildings, institutions and shops. All important places are tastefully decorated. Meetings and seminars are held to explain the importance of the day. On this day we pay rich tributes  to the memory of the day. On this day we pay rich tributes to the memory of the martyrs  who laid down their lives for the sake of our independence. So let all of us remember the spirit of the victory and see to establish just laws in the country to build it as a country which rightly be called 'Sonar Bangla'.\n"

          "explanation": "Once a golden necklace was lost in a rich man's house. A few servants worked in that house. Naturally, it was suspected that any one of the servants had stolen the necklace. The rich man, unwilling to report the matter to the authorities, decided to resolve it himself.\nHe called all the servants together and calmly said, “I know one of you has taken the necklace, but I do not want to punish anyone unfairly. I will give you each a stick. All these sticks are of the same length. Take them home and bring them back tomorrow. The thief’s stick will grow by an inch overnight.”\nThe servants were surprised but took the sticks and returned to their rooms. That night, the guilty servant could not sleep. He was terrified that his stick would grow, revealing his crime. So, out of fear, he cut an inch off his stick, hoping to avoid suspicion.\nThe next day, all the servants returned with their sticks. The rich man collected them and carefully measured each one. One stick was shorter by exactly an inch.\nThe rich man smiled and turned to the servant holding the shorter stick. “You are the thief,” he said calmly. “The sticks were ordinary. None of them were going to grow. But your fear betrayed you.”\nCaught and ashamed, the servant confessed to the theft. The rich man, though saddened, forgave him but dismissed him from service, reminding everyone that honesty and trust are more valuable than gold.\nMoral: A guilty conscience will always reveal the truth."

(No. 1 has been done for you.)\nThe history of Bengal is the history of a people who have repeatedly made their highways red with their blood. We shed blood in 1952; even though we were the victors in the elections of 1954, we could not form a government then. In 1958, Ayub Khan declared Martial Law to enslave us for the next ten years. In 1966 when we launched the Six Point movement our boys were shot dead on 7 June. When after the movement of 1969 Ayub Khan fell from power and Yahya Khan assumed the reins of the government he declared that he would give us a constitution and restore democracy; we listened to him then. A lot has happened since and elections have taken place.\nI've met President Yahya Khan. I've made a request to him not only on behalf of Bengal but also as the leader of the party which has the majority in Pakistan; I said to him: \"You must hold the session of the National Assembly on 15 February.\" But he did not listen to me. He listened to Mr. Bhutto instead. At first, he said that the meeting would take place in the first week of March. We said, \"Fine, we will be taking our seats in the Assembly then.\" I said we would carry out our discussions in the Assembly.\n1.Bloodshed in 1952→\n2.→\n3.→\n4.→\n5.→\n6.",
