          "explanation": "Title: \"The Price of Greed\"\nOnce a farmer had a goose. It used to lay a golden egg every day. The farmer used to sell them in the market and within a short time, he became quite solvent. But his wife was very greedy. She was not satisfied with one golden egg a day. She often grumbled, “If this goose lays one golden egg daily, there must be a heap of gold inside it!”\nBlinded by her greed, she convinced the farmer to kill the goose and collect all the gold at once. Though hesitant, the farmer finally gave in. They slaughtered the goose with great hope and tore it open—only to find nothing inside.\nThere was no heap of gold, not even a single extra egg. The magic was gone. The goose was dead, and with it, their daily fortune vanished.\nMoral: Greed destroys the source of good fortune.\n"

          "explanation": "The bar graph illustrates the steady increase in the number of internet users in Bangladesh from 2014 to 2019. The graph shows that in 2014, there were around 40 million users, which increased to approximately 60 million by 2015. Then, the number of users suddenly decreased and reached 50 million in 2016. Only this particular year marks a decrease in the number of users. Then, a significant surge occurred in 2017 and the number of internet users jumped to 70 million. This marks an increase highlighting a rapid growth in internet accessibility and usage. The number of users remained same in 2018. Finally, in 2019, the number of internet users took another jump and turned into 80 million in total. Analysing the graph, we find that within five years, the number of internet users in Bangladesh increased significantly, making it double. It is a clear indication that during this period, the country's digital infrastructure improved significantly. It also shows that people of Bangladesh are. getting accustomed to the modern technologies."

In your letter, you've wanted to know about the foods and food habits in Bangladesh. I'm writing to you about them in short.\nThe food habit of the people of one country differs from that of other countries. The Bangladeshis have some special food habits. Usually, we take three meals a day- breakfast, lunch and dinner. Rice is our staple food. We are fond of fishes and 'Hilsa' is the most favourite of all fishes. Traditionally, we are called 'the nation of fish and rice\". Chicken, beef and mutton are also our favourite dishes. People commonly eat rice with vegetables, fish or meat curry and pulses. On occasions, we like to have khichuri, polao and biryani, etc. Tea is the most popular drink in our country. We like to have seasonal fruits. Our favourite fruits come in thousands of varieties but jackfruits, mangoes and bananas are the most popular. Different type of sweets\nare also made in our country especially with milk. Besides, the Bangladeshis are fond of different kinds of 'pithas' and 'payesh.' Pithas like 'patisapta', 'bhapa', 'chitai' are some of the most favourite ones. They are made on different occasions (উপলক্ষে).\nNo more today. Please write to me soon about the foods and food habits in UK.\nLovingly yours,\nIsam"

      "uddipok": "Read the following text and make a flow chart showing the features of dream. (One is done for you.)\nDreams have fascinated philosophers for thousands of years, but only recently have dreams been subjected to empirical research and scientific study. Chances are that you've often found yourself puzzling over the content of a dream, or perhaps you've' wondered why you dream at all. First, let's start by answering a basic question: What is a dream? A dream can include any of the images, thoughts and emotions that are experienced during sleep. Dreams. can be extraordinarily vivid or very vague; filled with joyful emotions or frightening images, focused and understandable or unclear and confusing.\nWhy do we dream? What purpose do dreams serve? While many theories have been proposed no consensus has emerged. Considering the time. we spend in a dreaming state, the fact that researchers do not yet understand the purpose of dreams may seem baffling. However, it is important to consider that science is still unraveling the exact purpose and function of sleep itself: Some researchers suggest that dreams serve no real purpose, while others believe that dreaming is essential to mental, emotional and physical well-being.\nNext, let's learn more about some of the most prominent dream theories. Consistent with the psychoanalytic perspective, Sigmund Freud's theory of dreams suggests that dreams are a representation of subconscious desires, thoughts and motivations. According to Freud, people are driven by aggressive and sexual instincts that are repressed from conscious awareness. While these thoughts are not consciously expressed, they find their way into our awareness via dreams. In his famous book The Interpretation of Dreams (1899). Freud wrote that dreams are \"..... disguised fulfilments of repressed wishes.\"\nFull of thoughts, images and emotions→\n2.→\n3.→\n4.→\n5.→\n6.",

Increased tourism to sensitive areas without proper planning and marfagement can actually harm the ecosystem and its species because the infrastructure needed to sustain tourism such as roads can contribute to environmental degradation.\nEcotourism is also said by critics to have a negative impact on local communities because the arrival of foreign visitors and wealth can shift political and economic conditions of the area. It can also make the area dependent more on tourism than its domestic economic practices.\nWhile ecotourism becomes popular, we must however, remain cautious about its adverse effects and do our best to protect the environment and ecosystem.\n1.

She told me to go away Now she is married to another man. My father lives very far away. I want to go to him, but he won't take me either. I begged him to send me some money so that I could buy a bus ticket. I am still waiting. He has not answered: The streets are now my home. Sometimes I find work. I used to collect trash and sell it to a vendor. I stopped doing that after I had a serious infection and a doctor told me to stay away from the trash dump. Once I worked for an ice-cream shop owner and sold ice-cream on the beach. But I got no money in return. The owner of the shop gave me something to eat, and let me sleep in his hut at night. The work was difficult and painful. The ice-cream box is quite heavy when it is full. I had to walk for hours, offering my ice-cream to whoever wanted to buy.. There were days when I could not even sell one ice-cream. In a way, I am lucky because I am alive. My friends who work sorting rubbish in dumps often suffer from serious diseases. One of them was recently killed after he fell into a hole that opened up in the pile of trash. Many of us work for 10 to 12 hours, and get so little in return that we can't even buy food.",

His mother sent him away, and his father, who lives far away, has not responded to his pleas for help. Amerigo survives by finding occasional work, such as collecting and selling trash, despite the health risks involved. He once worked for an ice-cream shop but received no money, only food and a place to sleep. Despite the hardships, Amerigo considers himself fortunate to be alive, unlike some of his friends who have suffered serious illnesses or even death from their work in trash dumps. Many like him work long hours for minimal pay, struggling to afford basic necessities like food."
