(One has been done for you):\nThe Island of St. Martin is the only coral island in Bangladesh located in the north-eastern part of Bay of Bengal. The roughly flat island is only above 3.6 metre above the sea level. The entire island can be walked about in 3 hours. The island is known for its unique natural beauty with white sandy beaches fringed with coconut palms and a diverse marine life. Due to the expansion of unregulated tourism, the island is facing increasing erosion, contamination of surface and ground water, wildlife displacement, and loss of biodiversity. Other threats include cutting of sand dune vegetation for fuel-wood and hotel establishment; degradation of sand dune habitat; the harvesting of turtle eggs; indiscriminate exploitation of coral resources etc. To address this, the Government has declared some areas of the island as Ecologically Critical Area (ECA), prohibiting unauthorized constructions there.\nOnly coral island in Bangladesh → 2. → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6",

      "uddipok": "Write a summary of the following text.\nThe famous Greek philosopher Aristotle said, \"Man is by nature a social animal.\" What he meant was that man, by instinct, seeks company of others and establishes relationships, much like most animals of the wild, for companionship and for physical and emotional support. Unlike the animals however, man's relationships give meaning to his existence and inspires him to do well in education, in workplace or in a profession that he pursues.\nRelationships are of different kinds. Some are familial and intimate, formed by blood and by marriage; some are social like the ones we have with friends and some are made in school where we, form close bonds with classmates and teachers. Relationships can also be fostered in workplace, which may quickly change from professional to social. There are relationships also between human beings and animals, between children and their toys that they cannot part with.\nAll these relationships keep us close to each other and provide us all kinds of support, love and affection. A person who has no family feels the pain of loneliness and isolation. There is no one to laugh or cry with him/her. When we share our joy with someone, it simply redoubles, and when we suffer a loss and someone shares our sorrow, it lessens. Relationships are thus needed for our emotional health.\nTo build relationships, we need to have trust and respect for each other, and love where this is needed. We cannot be selfish and possessive if we want to establish an effective relationship. But quite often we see people quarrelling and fighting with each other which only brings misery and loss to all.",

          "explanation": "The passage portrays the fact that human beings naturally develop different types of relationships through trust, respect and love. Relationships are formed by blood or marriage, in educational institutions or workplaces, etc. Relationships give meaning to our existence and inspire us to perform well in every stage. Moreover, relationships fill our life with love, support, and endearment. Lonely and isolated people cannot share their joy or sorrow. Through sharing, happiness increases, and sorrows decreases. Hence, relationships are essential for mental health. However, relationships with selfishness and possessiveness are detrimental to mental health and cause sufferings."

Failing to buy the one she brought a guitar for him and said, “This is all I could manage, my dear. I know you wanted the bicycle, but sometimes, life doesn’t go as we hope. This guitar might not be what you asked for, but I believe it will help you find joy in other ways.”\nThe boy looked at the guitar, feeling a mix of disappointment and confusion. He had imagined riding around on a shiny new bicycle, feeling the wind in his hair, but now, his mother had given him something entirely different. “But, Mom,” he said softly, “I really wanted the bicycle. I even saved some money.”\nHis mother smiled gently and replied, “I understand, sweetheart. But sometimes, the things we don’t expect can bring us even more happiness than we imagined. The bicycle would have taken you to places, but this guitar might take you to the heart of music, something that can stay with you forever.”\nThe boy hesitated, then picked up the guitar. Over time, he learned to play it beautifully, and it became his true companion. He realized that the love and effort his mother had put into the gift was worth more than any material possession. The guitar brought him joy, and in the end, it became a symbol of his mother’s unwavering love and sacrifice."

          "explanation": "[Your Address] [City, Postal Code] [Date]\nDear [Friend's Name],\nI hope this letter finds you in the best of health and spirits. I’ve been meaning to write to you about something I’ve realized recently: the immense importance of traveling.\nAs you know, I’ve been able to visit a few places this year, and each trip has taught me something valuable. Traveling allows you to experience different cultures, traditions, and lifestyles. It opens your mind to new ideas, perspectives, and ways of thinking. Whether it's through trying new foods, learning about local customs, or simply conversing with people from different backgrounds, traveling enriches our understanding of the world.\nMoreover, traveling offers a much-needed break from the monotony of daily life. It refreshes the mind and spirit, helping you to relax and gain a new sense of clarity. I’ve found that I return home with a greater appreciation for the little things and a renewed sense of energy.\nAnother significant benefit of traveling is that it helps to build self-confidence. Navigating unfamiliar places, figuring out directions, and interacting with strangers all challenge us to step out of our comfort zones, leading to personal growth.\nI strongly recommend that you plan a trip soon, even if it's just to a nearby place. It’s an experience you’ll never regret.\nLooking forward to hearing from you soon. Take care.\nWarm regards, [Your Name]"
