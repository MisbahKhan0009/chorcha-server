          "explanation": "\n(a)\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines adolescence as the period of life between 10 and 19 years of age. This stage marks the transition from childhood to adulthood, characterized by significant physical, emotional, and social development. Adolescents experience rapid growth and undergo various changes that influence their health, behavior, and interactions with society.\n(b)\nAccording to the 2022 Bangladesh Census, the population of adolescents aged 10–14 is approximately 16.6 million, with 8.5 million boys and 7.8 million girls. For the 15–19 age group, there are about 16.5 million adolescents, comprising 8.1 million boys and 8.5 million girls. In total, adolescents make up about 28.8% of Bangladesh's population, with a near-equal distribution between boys and girls.\n(c)\nAdolescent girls in Bangladesh face several challenges\nChild Marriage : Approximately 51% of girls in Bangladesh are married before the age of 18, making it one of the highest rates globally.\nEducation : While enrollment rates for girls have improved, many still face barriers to completing secondary education, especially in rural areas.\nHealth Risks : Early pregnancies pose significant health risks, with many adolescent girls becoming mothers before reaching adulthood.\nViolence and Abuse : A significant number of adolescent girls experience physical or sexual violence, often within intimate relationships.\nThese issues hinder their development and access to opportunities, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.\n(d)\nIn Bangladesh, the legal age for marriage is 18 for girls and 21 for boys, as stipulated by the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 2017. However, the law includes provisions that allow for exceptions under certain circumstances, such as parental consent and court approval, which have been criticized for potentially undermining efforts to prevent child marriage.\n(e)\nWhile the legal age for marriage is 21 for boys in Bangladesh, readiness for marriage is influenced by various factors beyond age, including emotional maturity, financial stability, and societal expectations. Cultural norms often dictate that men should be established in their careers and capable of supporting a family before marriage. However, these expectations can vary widely across different communities and regions within the country."

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following text.\n\"The Negro is still not free. The life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. The Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. The Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. So, we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.... I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal. I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of 'interposition' and 'nullification', that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.\"",

          "explanation": "The text is part of a speech about the racial discrimination prevailing in the American society against the Negro.' Here the speaker says that Black people are still not free because of unfair treatment. They live in poverty while others are rich. The Black feel like strangers in their own country. Even with these struggles, the speaker has a dream. He dreams that one day, everyone will be treated as equals. He hopes that former slaves' children and former slave owners' children will live peacefully together. He dreams that every state will become fair and that  his children will be judged by their character, not by their skin color. He also hopes that black and white  children in Alabama will become friends."

This is the faith that I shall go back to the south with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope. With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood.\nWith this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day........ .\nAnd if America is to be a great nation, this must become true. So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire. Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York. Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania. Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi. From every mountainside, let freedom ring.\nAnd when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual. \"Free at last! Free at last! Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!\" (abridged).\nRead the passage and then write the antonym or synonym of the words as directed below:\n(a) dream (synonym) (b) straight (synonym) (c) faith (antonym) (d) freedom (synonym) (e) happen (antonym) (f) mountain (synonym) (g) reveal (antonym) (h) discord (antonym) (i) mighty (antonym) (j) let (synonym)",

This day reminds us of the supreme sacrifice of our freedom fighters who will ever shine in our hearts like the luminous stars in the sky. But at the same time we must remember the spirit of the liberation war. We wanted a country where justice will prevail over injustice and wrong. Instead , we are now having a night-marish experience of lawlessness, violence and misrule. The lords of the mischief mongers are getting upper hand in the society, whereas the meek and mild become the worst sufferers. Disorder  in everything has become the order of the day. Every year the Government, different organization and institutions take elaborate programmes to celebrate the day on a befitting manner. The national flag is hosted in all important offices, buildings, institutions and shops. All important places are tastefully decorated. Meetings and seminars are held to explain the importance of the day. On this day we pay rich tributes  to the memory of the day. On this day we pay rich tributes to the memory of the martyrs  who laid down their lives for the sake of our independence. So let all of us remember the spirit of the victory and see to establish just laws in the country to build it as a country which rightly be called 'Sonar Bangla'.\n"

He was quite at a loss to see the purse and decided to pick it up. He was not at all greedy and so was not in the least interested in grabbing the contents in the purse. He intended to open the purse to see if there was any visiting card. Fortunately, he found some visiting cards and ID card of the owner. Then the boy became somewhat pacified thinking that he might eventually return the purse to its real owner. However, the boy carried the bag to his parents. His parents were very pious and honest who were bringing up their son with proper moral and religious education. His father Mr. Sumon found the owner's address and mobile number on the visiting card. He called the number. The man who received phone sounded very anxious. Mr. Sumon asked him about his identity. Mr. Sumon noticed that the identity of the man corresponded with the visiting card and ID card. And the man's name was Mr. Rashid. Mr. Sumon asked Mr. Rashid if he had lost anything. Mr. Rashid anxiously replied that he had lost a purse containing a great amount of money and some documentary papers. Mr. Rashid's information completely corresponded (সংগতিপূর্ণ হওয়া) with the contents of the purse. M r \\mathrm{Mr} Mr . Sumon was certain that he (Mr. Rashid) was the real owner of the purse. He (Mr. Sumon) told him (Mr. Rashid) not to worry about the purse, adding that he (Mr. Rashid) would get back everything. Then Mr. Sumon told him to come to his (Mr. Sumon) address to receive his purse. Mr. Rashid and his wife at once started for Mr. Sumon's house. Mr. Sumon handed over the purse to Mr. Rashid. Mr. Rashid was overwhelmed with gratefulness and hugged Mr. Sumon. Mr. Rashid appreciated the boy for his honesty. Since then the two families developed a great friendly relationship between themselves."
