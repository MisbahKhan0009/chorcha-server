(One is done for you)\nMeditation in our time is practiced by people to reduce stress and tension, and improve focus. There are trainers who help beginners with some exercises such as improved breathing and progressive relaxation. One of the most common approaches to meditation is concentration. To develop concentration one needs to focus on a single point. Since focusing the mind is challenging, a beginner might meditate for only a few minutes and then work up to longer durations. Meditation releases anxiety and brings a state of calmness. It increases the thinking ability of human brain so that people have a better control of their emotions. Those who practice meditation can work tirelessly for a longer period of time. Meditation helps improve blood circulation in the brain and other parts of the body.

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following passage.\nWe spend money for different reasons. We buy foods, clothes or everyday essentials, pay for different services, entertain people, travel to places, help others in need or invest in business and thus spend money every day. In fact, spending is a part of our life.\nSpending may make us happy or unhappy depending on how and why we spend. When we spend money on things that we need and within our limit, it is good. When it becomes a compulsive behaviour, it makes life stressful. Unnecessary spending or spending beyond one's means has some bad effects. For one thing, it may lead to financial ruin or debt, and for another,. it may create unhappiness within families. People who overspend are never satisfied with what they have. They always rush for brands, fashion items, designer clothes, etc. Over a period of time, it becomes an addiction which may eventually create psychological problems.\nNowadays, consumer items are displayed in stores or in advertisements in ways that they create a feeling of immediate need for them. We are constantly tempted to buy, use or consume things even when we do not have a genuine need. We all need to be careful here. Salespersons often encourage customers to buy things by flattering them. 'This is a perfect match for you,' they would say. or 'You look so stunning in that dress.' Never forget, they say the same thing to most of their customers. It is better not to be persuaded by such words. They use these words to please the customers as the more a customer buys, the higher the profit is. Overspending is not only related to shopping, it applies to other activities as well such as eating out. Many people buy too many items to eat in a restaurant. They can eat only some of them and the rest are wasted: It's not a responsible attitude. We cannot simply waste food because we have money to buy it.\nYoung people in a shopping mall often look at an item on display afd think 'Oh I must buy this. I really need this.' They may not have the money needed. In their wallet. So, they use credit cards but using them is like taking a loan. If they are not careful, the loans increase which might lead them to a debt-trap.\nSometimes children insist on buying things that their parents cannot pay without stretching their budget. This may happen because the children's friends also have them. It's not fair as it becomes a burden for the parents.\nFinally, don't get trapped by the glossy advertisements on television or the Internet. You should rather ask yourself: \"Do I need this?\" The best way to control the habit of spending is not to think 'What I need', but 'Can I do without it?'",

          "explanation": "Money is spent every day for various reasons. Necessary expenses within our limit may make us happy. But unnecessary expenditure or spending money beyond our ability creates some problems and may lead to psychological problems. At present, consumer items are exhibited and advertised so attractively that we want to buy them immediately even without having a genuine need. Salespersons often flatter the customers to encourage them to buy more things. Buying more foods than requirements and their wastage means wastage of money. Children also make their parents fall in economic crisis by pressurizing them to buy unnecessary things. We should restrain this habit of overspending by asking ourselves if we can do without the thing we feel tempted to buy."

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following text.\nMany adolescents face pressure to use alcohol, cigarettes, or other drugs and to initiate sexual relationships putting\nthemselves at high risk for intentional and unintentłonal injuries, unintended pregnancies, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Many also experience a wide range of adjustment and mental health problems. Behaviour patterns that are established during this period such as the use or avoidance of drugs and taking or abstaining from sexual risk can have long-lasting negative and positive effects on future health and well-being. As a result, adults have unique opportunities to influence adolescents. Adolescents are different both from young children and adults. Specifically, adolescents are not fully capable of understanding complex concepts, or the relationship between behaviour and consequences, or the degree of control they have or can have over health decision-making, including that related to sexual behaviour. This inability may make them particularly vulnerable to sexual exploitation and high-risk behaviours. Laws, customs, and practices may also affect adolescents differently than adults. For example, laws and policies often restrict adolescents' access to reproductive health information and services, especially when they are unmarried. In addition, even when services do exist, provider attitudes about adolescents often pose a significant barrier to the use of those services.",

          "explanation": "This passage highlights on the critical moments of adolescents, and the complexity and pressures they face during adolescence period. This phase is so critical since he/she has to face difficulties to adjust with them. They face life-destructing pressures and a wide range of mental and health problems. Also, this period is the shaper of his/her future with negative or positive effects. Adolescents are unable to perceive the complex concepts of life. Therefore, they become very vulnerable to high-risk behaviours and sexual exploitation. There are some restrictions and laws imposed on them to control or prevent them from going astray. As this phase is so critical for them, adults and other concerned authorities should be aware to guide them in the right direction."

          "explanation": "The graph illustrates the increase in the number of overseas students at universities over a 20-year period, from 2000 to 2020.\nIn 2000, the number of international students was relatively low, just above 200. This figure remained almost unchanged until around 2005, showing a very slow rate of growth. However, after 2005, there was a sharp upward trend. The number of overseas students began to rise rapidly and continued to grow steadily through 2010. By this point, the number had reached around 1000 students.\nFrom 2010 to 2015, the growth began to slow down, although it still maintained an upward trajectory. After 2015, the graph shows a plateau, with student numbers leveling off at around 1100, indicating saturation or stabilization in growth.\nIn summary, the graph depicts a significant rise in the number of international students between 2005 and 2015, followed by a stable period. The overall trend reflects growing global interest in higher education during this time."

But he could not get any. Then instead of losing heart, he returned to his village with a new determination in his eyes.\nHe looked around and realized that his village had fertile land but no modern farming techniques. Most farmers used outdated methods and earned very little. Rizu decided to bring change. He started learning about advanced agriculture, organic farming, and small-scale agribusinesses through free online courses and government workshops.\nSoon, he started his own organic farm. He grew vegetables, fruits, and herbs without chemicals and sold them in the city as premium produce. People loved the quality. In just a few years, his farm turned into a successful business. He even began training other villagers.\nRizu didn’t just find success—he created it.\nMoral: True wisdom turns obstacles into opportunities."

This information was just like a bolt from the blue to me. I did not expect it as I knew that, you had always been very careful and cautious about maintaining safe distance and wearing mask. Anyway, \"Prevention is better than cure\" does not always work. Sometimes, many unexpected (অপ্রত্যাশিত) things happen in our life and we must remain ready to face and fight them out. COVID-19 is now a pandemic (অতিমারী/বৈশ্বিক মহামারি); anybody may be infected with COVID-19 any time and anywhere. So, there is nothing to be worried. Many COVID-19 patients are being dehospitalized everyday after full recovery. Have patience and follow your doctor's advice. You are a conscious person and I am sure you will maintain your quarantine (সঙ্গনিরোধ) period properly. By the grace of the Almighty, you will come round very soon. Don't lose your mental strength. Courage and mental strength play a vital role to cure a COVID-19 patient. You know vaccination programme is going on across the world including our country. So, after getting fully recovered, don't make delay in getting vaccinated.\nWishing your earliest recovery.\nYour loving friend,\nSumon"
