          "explanation": "\n(a)\nHuman relationships are characterized by complexity, depth, and emotional bonding. While animals form social groups for survival and reproduction, humans establish relationships that encompass emotional, intellectual, and social dimensions. These relationships are often based on mutual respect, trust, and shared experiences, leading to personal growth and societal development.\n(b)\nThis statement, attributed to Aristotle, suggests that humans are inherently inclined to live in communities and form relationships. Unlike other animals, humans seek companionship, cooperation, and social interaction, which are essential for survival and fulfillment. Our ability to communicate, empathize, and collaborate distinguishes us as social beings.\n(c)\nRelationships are fundamental to human well-being. They provide emotional support, foster a sense of belonging, and contribute to personal happiness. Positive relationships can enhance mental health, reduce stress, and improve overall life satisfaction. Conversely, lack of meaningful connections can lead to feelings of isolation and negative health outcomes.\n(d)\nIndividuals without family often experience loneliness and a lack of emotional support. The absence of close familial bonds can lead to feelings of isolation, which may negatively impact mental and physical health. However, forming strong friendships and community connections can help mitigate these effects.\n(e)\nRelationships can be categorized into several types:\nFamilial Relationships : Connections with family members, such as parents, siblings, and extended family.\nFriendships : Bonds formed with peers based on mutual affection and shared interests.(en.wikipedia.org)\nRomantic Relationships : Emotional and physical connections between partners.(theguardian.com)\nProfessional Relationships : Interactions with colleagues, mentors, and business associates.\nCommunity Relationships : Connections within local or online communities based on shared values or goals.\nHuman-Animal Relationships : Bonds between humans and animals, often providing companionship and emotional support."

      "uddipok": "Read the following text and make a flow chart showing the function of education. (One is done for you):\nEducation gives us knowledge and a set of abilities to function meaningfully in life, such as the ability to decide things rationally and make the right choices. As we learn how to read, write and do the basic operations of arithmetic, we gain a degree of self-confidence. We learn to think for ourselves and articulate our thoughts; we pick up skills to communicate with others and manage our affairs well. Education helps us think independently and make our own, opinions. As we know more about the world, we appreciate the good things it offers us but also become critical of the deviations from the values it imparts and the rise of hatred or conflict that follows.\nThe first thing education does is to give us an awareness about ourselves which leads to the development of our personality. As we begin school, we feel the need to belong to the class and make friends. We then expand our sense of belonging to include the school at large, our community and finally our country. Education thus prepares every child to become an active member of the community and work for its welfare.\n1. Giving us knowledge. → 2. → 3. → 4. → 5. → 6.",

The poet uses powerful imagery, comparing a life without dreams to a broken-winged bird that cannot fly and a barren, snow-covered field—both symbolizing hopelessness and stagnation. Dreams give life direction, meaning, and hope."

So, she started giving tuition to some younger children in her neighborhood. With the little money she earned, she bought books and paid her school fees. Often she had to study late at night by the dim light of a lamp after finishing all the household chores.\nHer teachers noticed her sincerity and encouraged her. One day, the headmaster came to know about her struggle and arranged a scholarship for her. From then on, her financial worries lessened, and she could study with a free mind.\nAt last, after years of hard work and determination, Rini stood first in her board examination. Her parents were overjoyed, and the whole village felt proud of her. Her success proved that with courage and perseverance, nothing is impossible."
