He has told you that there is a pain in his head. Let him show me the pain, and I shall show him God.\" The judge was pleased with the Sadhu's defence and dismissed the case."

Have you heard about the selfie mania?\nA selfie is a picture that you take of yourself using a camera of a mobile phone. And when taking selfies become an addiction, it is called selfie mania. Selfies are fun. But there are some risks we should know about taking selfies. Sometimes, people take selfies in dangerous places. This can be really risky because they might get hurt. Also, some people become too focused on taking the perfect selfie and forget to pay attention to what's happening around them. They might walk into\nthings or even step out into the road without looking.\nSo, it's important to be careful while taking selfies. Anyway, tender my regards to your parents and love to the\nyoungers.\nYours ever,\nMelina."

      "uddipok": "Write a summary of the following passage.\nEducation aims to bring about positive changes in our behavior. It helps us try to change our lives as well as the society we live in. Education that does not illuminate our minds or does not inspire us to work for the community is not complete at all. Education is not all about getting grades or receiving certificates- we use education to make life better. We are expected to apply the knowledge, skills and values that we learn in a classroom in our engagement with the world that lies outside. And we can do so in many different ways. Let's have a look at how education works. Learners' civic engagement is highly appreciated all over the world. Civic engagement means working to make a difference in the civic life (the public life of the citizens as constructed with private or personal life) of the community using knowledge, skills, values and motivation. Civic engagement promotes the quality of life in a community by contributing to the improvement of health and wellbeing of the people.\nCivically engaged individuals recognize themselves as members of a larger social community and are concerned about civic issues. They consider themselves responsible citizens who take action or raise their voices against injustice, discrimination and other forms of social ills.\nIn civic engagement, issues of public concern are crucial. Civic engagement includes individual or group activities to protect public interests and change the way the community values itself. For example, If you are protesting against any unjust decision of the local municipality such as raising taxes or an act that might work against people's interests, you are civically engaged and your action is considered a civic engagement. This protest can be done in different ways such as organizing rallies, collecting signatures, making human chains, writing petitions, etc. You can also help control traffic in front of a school, help children to cross the roads, work in a team to clean a park or a sea beach. You can also give some services to elderly people. These are all examples of civic engagement as what you do directly affects the community.\nWhen civic engagement is a part of an academic program, and the learners' engagement is assessed following a scale, then it is called service learning. It involves the application of knowledge and skills learned in the classroom and then making a complete plan of action 1.e. preparing a budget, starting the process of implementation, involving people and activating operational strategies.",

Don't play with chopsticks or point at anyone with them.\nGift: Do present and receive things with both hands. Politely refusing a gift before accepting it is the norm in Chinese culture, so don't be discouraged when someone initially refuses your gift. White flowers are not good as they symbolize death. Greetings: Shake hands softly as a firm handshake could be considered a sign of aggression. It may make your Chinese friends feel uncomfortable. Greet the most senior first and gradually others.

In addition, the poet compares a life void of dream with a 'barren field' which is covered with frozen snow. Indeed, we must cherish a dream to be súccessful in life."
