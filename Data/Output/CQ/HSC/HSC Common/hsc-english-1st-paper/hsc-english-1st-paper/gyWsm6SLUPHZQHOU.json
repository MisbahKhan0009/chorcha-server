You must also have been taught to be polite in company and keep quiet while others, especially your elders, spoke. Possibly, you at times grudged such schooling. Possibly, at times you even protested such disciplining. Now, certainly you know that you can't always behave the way you want specially in the presence of others. There are rules of behavior you have to follow in a company. We are social beings and have to consider the effect of our behavior on others, even if we are at home and dealing with our family members.\nWe have two terms to describe our social behavior- 'etiquette' and 'manners'. 'Etiquette' is a French word and it means the rules of correct behavior in society. The word 'manners' means the behavior that is considered to be polite in a particular society or culture.\nManners can be good or bad. For example, it is a bad manner to speak with food in one's mouth. No one likes a bad mannered person. Remember that etiquette and manners vary from culture to culture and from society to society.",

          "explanation": "Summary:\nYou must have been taught as a young child to greet your elders and house guests in accordance with your culture and custom. Additionally, you must have been taught to be polite in public and to be silent when others, particularly your elders, spoke. Maybe you sometimes regretted your education. Maybe you even resisted such discipline at times. You are aware that you cannot always act in the way you like, especially when other people are present.\nEtiquette and manners are two words we use to describe how we behave in social situations. You can have good or awful manners. Speaking while chewing food, for instance, is impolite. A rude individual is not popular. Keep in mind that manners and etiquette differ from culture to culture and from society to society.\nEtiquette and manners are lessons we pick up from our parents, families, and other institutions like schools, colleges, or professional organisations."

(One is done for you.):—\nA vast mangrove forest shared by Bangladesh and India that is home to possibly 500 Bengal tigers is being rapidly destroyed by erosion, rising sea levels and storm surges, according to a major study by researchers at the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and others. Natalie Pettorelli, one of the report's authors, said, \"Coastline retreat is evident everywhere. A continuing rate of retreat would see these parts of the mangrove disappear within 50 years. On the Indian side of the Sundarbans, the island which extends most into the Bay of Bengal has receded by an average of 150 metres a year, with a maximum of just over 200 metres this would see the disappearance of the island in about 20 years.\" The Sundarbans is known for vanishing islands but the scientists said the current retreat of the mangrove forests on the southern coastline is not normal. \"The causes for increasing coastline retreat, other than anthropogenic ones, include increased frequency of storm surges and other extreme natural events, rises in seal-level and increased salinity which increases the vulnerability of mangroves,\" said Pettorelli.\n1.

These songs are also about social inequality and poverty, about the material world and the supernatural. Mystical songs have been composed using the metaphors of rivers and boats. Since the country is basically riverine, the Bhatiyali forms an important genre of folk music. Nature plays a role in providing the content and rhythm of folk music. The folk music of Bangladesh varies from region to region, reflecting changes in the natural environment and the dialects people use. Thus there are the northern Bhawaiya, the eastern Bhatiyali and the southwestern Baul songs.\nSongs reflecting rural and riverine life→\n2→\n3→\n4→\n5→\n6",

          "explanation": "Diaspora refers to the dispersion or scattering of a particular group of people, typically with a common cultural or ethnic background, to different parts of the world. This term is often used to describe the migration or exile of a specific community due to various reasons such as political unrest, economic opportunities, or conflict.\nThroughout history, numerous diasporas have occurred, shaping the cultural landscape of different regions. These diasporic communities often maintain a strong sense of identity, holding onto their cultural practices, languages, and traditions, while also assimilating to their new surroundings. The concept of diaspora highlights the interconnectedness and diversity of human experiences.\nIt showcases the resilience and adaptability of societies in the face of adversity. Diasporas have contributed significantly to the enrichment of cultural heritage and the exchange of ideas between different nations. Overall, diaspora represents the dynamic movement of people and the resulting cultural, social, and economic impacts on both the communities they originate from and the ones they settle in.\nIt serves as a reminder of the complex and multifaceted nature of human migration and the shared experiences that unite us globally."

He died at an early age. Then he was studying in class ten. He was hit by a speedy vehicle while going to his school. He was taken to hospital immediately but with no result; he left all of us in the midst of tears.\" Grandmother began to cry. Romin went closer to her and said, \"Sorry, Grandma! I didn't want to make you cry.\" Grandma recovered and hugged him and said to him, \"I'm happy that you discovered the photo for me.\""

          "explanation": "The pie chart displays the various sources of air pollution in a city, highlighting five key contributors. Vehicles are by far the most significant source, accounting for 60% of total air pollution. This indicates a heavy reliance on private and commercial transportation, possibly due to limited public transport infrastructure. Industry is the second-largest contributor at 18% , reflecting emissions from factories and manufacturing units. Power plants contribute 13% , suggesting that electricity generation—likely from fossil fuels—is another major pollutant. Waste disposal activities are responsible for 3% , while heating or using gas contributes nothing ( 0% ), showing negligible or highly controlled emissions in that category.\nThe disparity is stark: vehicles alone contribute more than all other sources combined, underscoring the urgent need for cleaner transport alternatives and stricter vehicular emission controls. In contrast, waste disposal and gas usage have a minimal impact, suggesting these are not major areas of concern. Targeted interventions in transport and industry could significantly improve air quality."
