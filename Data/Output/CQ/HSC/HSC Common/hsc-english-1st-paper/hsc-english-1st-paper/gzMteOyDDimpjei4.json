          "explanation": "The given pie chart displays the units of electricity production by fuel in Italy in 1990. In the chart, the data shown are of nuclear power, natural gas, hydro power, oil and coal. Nuclear power produced 30% of electricity which is the highest in the chart. The second highest is by natural gas, which produced 25% of electricity and comparatively, it is only 5% less than nuclear power. According to the chart, the production of electricity after natural gas continues to decrease by 5%. At first, there is hydro power which produced 20% of electricity. Then there is oil which produced 15% of electricity. Lastly, there is coal which produced 10% of electricity and it is the lowest unit of production. So, after analyzing the chart it can be said that nuclear power produced the most electricity in Italy in 1990."

          "explanation": "\nOnce there lived a happy cobbler who passed his day working and singing from morning to night. His firm belief was that money cannot bring happiness. Happiness lies in contentment. A rich neighbor of his was a banker who one day came and said to him,” How much a year do you earn?” The cobbler replied, “I don’t know and I never think in that way as I live from hand to mouth.” The banker said, \"I am very sorry for your poverty. You should try to change your fortune.” The cobbler laughed and said, \"I am happy with what I can earn daily.” The next day the banker came again and said, “Look, my friend! I want to drive away your distress. Take these thousand pounds, keep it carefully and use it in time of need.\"\nThe cobbler became very much surprised having the large amount. He had never seen so much money at a time in his life before. At first, he could not think where he should hide the money for safety. Then, he dug a hole in his hut and buried it.\nAt night, a new thinking crossed over his mind, “someone might steal my money.” As a result, he could not sleep at all.\n\n\nNext few days, he could neither do any work nor sleep at night for the thinking of money. At last, he could realize that the money had snatched away his mental peace and happiness. So, one morning he went to the banker’s house and returned the money. From then, he could pass his days with singing and great happiness as before.\nMoral Of the Story: Money cannot bring happiness. Happiness lies in the self contentment.\n"

A 15 member team of the National Food Safety Laboratory, with support from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), came up with the findings after collecting and testing food samples from the capital's Gulshan, Karwanbazar and Mohakhali markets.\nThe survey report, a copy of which was acquired by the Dhaka Tribune, read that nearly 40% of 82 samples of milk, milk products, fish, fruits and vegetables contained banned pesticides such DDT, Aldrin, Chlordance as and Heptachlor. The amount of pesticides in these samples was found to be 3 to 20 times greater than the limits set by the European Union, Around 50% vegetables and 35% fruits were found to be contaminated with unsafe level of pesticides. Analyzing more than 30 samples of turmeric power (branded, packaged and open), the team also found that nearly 30% of the samples contained traces of lead chromate, which can be fatal if swallowed or inhaled. These samples also contained lead at 20 to 50.times above the safety limit of 2.5 parts per million set by the Bangladesh Standard Testing Institute (BSTI). Arsenic and Chromium above safety limits were detected in a\ntotal of 5 out of 13 rice samples. Using a sensitive High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) method developed by the Food Safety Lab, 66 samples were analyzed for the presence of formaldehyde. Adulteration was thereby detected in samples of coriander, mango and fresh shrimps.\n1. A good number of food items contaminated by pesticides and other\npoisonous substances → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6",

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following text.\nScientists have always wondered if there is life anywhere out in the Space besides us. They have joined together on a major project called the Communication with Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (CETI) which seeks to establish contact with any other living being in the universe. For this, they are beaming out radio signals into Space in the hope of attracting attention of \"others worlds\".\nIt was thought that there is life on Mars. But two Viking Spacecrafts that landed on Mars in 1976 did not provide much evidence of life. The pictures sent by them showed Mars having a red sky instead of a blue one like ours and a pinkish coloured iron-rich soil. Its gravity is about half as strong as that of Earth so that the atmosphere is also much thinner than our planet. It has deserts, high mountains, volcanoes, craters, grooves like canals as well as summer and winter seasons. But there are no trees or signs of any life forms. However, a close inspection of a meteorite from Mars that fell on the Earth has revealed tiny fossils like bacteria 3.6 billion years old. This proves that some form of life existed there in the past. But who knows! Space probes have also been sent to planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. It will take years of a Space probe to reach a planet and many more years to analyze all the data sent to Earth by these probes.",

While Mars was once thought to harbor life, evidence from Viking spacecraft in 1976 indicated otherwise. Inspite of having some similarities to earth in some aspects including seasonal and geographical features, there is no signs of life there. However, a meteorite from Mars containing ancient fossils suggests that life existed there in the past. Space probes have been sent to study other planets, but analyzing the data sent back to Earth will take many years to analyze."
