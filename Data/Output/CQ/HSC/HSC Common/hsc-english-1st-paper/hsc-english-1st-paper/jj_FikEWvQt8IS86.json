(No. 1 has been done for you.)\nThe history of Bengal is the history of a people who have repeatedly made their highways red with their blood. We shed blood in 1952; even though we were the victors in the elections of 1954, we could not form a government then. In 1958, Ayub Khan declared Martial Law to enslave us for the next ten years. In 1966 when we launched the Six Point movement our boys were shot dead on 7 June. When after the movement of 1969 Ayub Khan fell from power and Yahya Khan assumed the reins of the government he declared that he would give us a constitution and restore democracy; we listened to him then. A lot has happened since and elections have taken place.\nI've met President Yahya Khan. I've made a request to him not only on behalf of Bengal but also as the leader of the party which has the majority in Pakistan; I said to him: \"You must hold the session of the National Assembly on 15 February.\" But he did not listen to me. He listened to Mr. Bhutto instead. At first, he said that the meeting would take place in the first week of March. We said, \"Fine, we will be taking our seats in the Assembly then.\" I said we would carry out our discussions in the Assembly.\n1.Bloodshed in 1952→\n2.→\n3.→\n4.→\n5.→\n6.",

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following text.\nAccessibility to higher education implies that students get the opportunity to get university education and sufficient\nsupport from educational institutions. Increasing enrolment at the secondary and higher secondary level puts pressure on higher educational institutions. But due to limited capacity, only a small number of students may be enrolled in universities. Thus, each year a large number of students are denied access to higher education. Also, due to poverty and increase in educational expenses, students of the lower middle class do not get easy access to higher education. Moreover, those who get places in the universities have limited access to avail all kinds of diversified educational facilities relating to their study fields. Only about 12% of graduates enter higher educational institutions. More than 80% of these students are admitted to NU affiliated colleges. Others are absorbed by the public and private universities. In the last two decades, there has been a substantial rise in the number of students in private universities. According to the UGC Annual Report 2010, the number rose from 88,669 in 2005 to 2,00,752 in 2010.",

So, it began to fly but did not find any source of water anywhere.\n\n\nThe crow was very hopeful and patience. It was clever too. So, it did not lose heart and kept on flying. At last it found a jar in a garden. It became very pleased. It flew down and sat on the jar. But alas! There was a little water at the bottom of the jar and it was out of its reach. Hence, it tried to turn the jar over again and again but brought no result. After several efforts, the crow got tired and disappointed. In despair when it was about to leave the place, it noticed a heap of pebbles nearby. It got hope and hit upon a plan. The crow picked up some pebbles and started dropping into the jar one after another. As a result, the water of the jar rose up little by little. When the water came to the brim of the jar, the crow drank its heart content and flew away.\n\n\nIn this way, the strong will of the crow helped it to meet its thirst.\n"

Transport expenses consume 4% of the total income of the family. 31% is spent on house rents. 1% income of the family goes down to savings. Analysing the pie chart, we can say that the family spends the highest amount of money on food. Its second highest amount of total income is spent on house rent.
