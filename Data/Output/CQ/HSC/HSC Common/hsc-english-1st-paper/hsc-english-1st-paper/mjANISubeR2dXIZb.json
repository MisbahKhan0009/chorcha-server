These songs are also about social inequality and poverty, about the material world and the supernatural. Mystical songs have been composed using the metaphors of rivers and boats. Since the country is basically riverine, the Bhatiyali forms an important genre of folk music. Nature plays a role in providing the content and rhythm of folk music. The folk music of Bangladesh varies from region to region, reflecting changes in the natural environment and the dialects people use. Thus there are the northern Bhawaiya, the eastern Bhatiyali and the southwestern Baul songs.\nSongs reflecting rural and riverine life→\n2→\n3→\n4→\n5→\n6",

The moment to bridge the chasms that divide us has come.\" \"We have, at last, achieved our political emancipation.\" In 1993. Mandela was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, an honor he shared with F.W. de Klerk, the white African leader who had freed him from prison three years earlier and negotiated the end of apartheid. Mandela went on to play a prominent role on the world stage as an advocate of human dignity in the face of challenges ranging from political repression to AIDS. He formally left public life in June 2004 before his 86th birthday, telling his adoring countrymen: \"Don't call me. I'll call you.\" Charged with capital offences in the 1963 Rivonia Trial, his statement from the dock was his political testimony. \"During my lifetime, I have dedicated myself to this struggle of the African people. I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities,\" he told the court.\nwho/what\nevent/occurrence\nwhat/when\ntime/year\nMandela\n“I hate race discrimination……“\n(i)______\n1994\nF.

(One is done for you.)\nDreams have fascinated philosophers for thousands of years, but only recently have dreams been subjected to empirical research and scientific study. Chances are that you've often found yourself puzzling over the content of a dream, or perhaps you've' wondered why you dream at all. First, let's start by answering a basic question: What is a dream? A dream can include any of the images, thoughts and emotions that are experienced during sleep. Dreams. can be extraordinarily vivid or very vague; filled with joyful emotions or frightening images, focused and understandable or unclear and confusing.\nWhy do we dream? What purpose do dreams serve? While many theories have been proposed no consensus has emerged. Considering the time. we spend in a dreaming state, the fact that researchers do not yet understand the purpose of dreams may seem baffling. However, it is important to consider that science is still unraveling the exact purpose and function of sleep itself: Some researchers suggest that dreams serve no real purpose, while others believe that dreaming is essential to mental, emotional and physical well-being.\nNext, let's learn more about some of the most prominent dream theories. Consistent with the psychoanalytic perspective, Sigmund Freud's theory of dreams suggests that dreams are a representation of subconscious desires, thoughts and motivations. According to Freud, people are driven by aggressive and sexual instincts that are repressed from conscious awareness. While these thoughts are not consciously expressed, they find their way into our awareness via dreams. In his famous book The Interpretation of Dreams (1899). Freud wrote that dreams are \"..... disguised fulfilments of repressed wishes.\"\nFull of thoughts, images and emotions→\n2.→\n3.→\n4.→\n5.→\n6.",

          "explanation": "The bar graph illustrates the steady increase in the number of internet users in Bangladesh from 2014 to 2019. The graph shows that in 2014, there were around 40 million users, which increased to approximately 60 million by 2015. Then, the number of users suddenly decreased and reached 50 million in 2016. Only this particular year marks a decrease in the number of users. Then, a significant surge occurred in 2017 and the number of internet users jumped to 70 million. This marks an increase highlighting a rapid growth in internet accessibility and usage. The number of users remained same in 2018. Finally, in 2019, the number of internet users took another jump and turned into 80 million in total. Analysing the graph, we find that within five years, the number of internet users in Bangladesh increased significantly, making it double. It is a clear indication that during this period, the country's digital infrastructure improved significantly. It also shows that people of Bangladesh are. getting accustomed to the modern technologies."

          "explanation": "Rina works in a big garment factory. There are more than five hundred workers in the factory. One day, as usual, she was busy at her work. Suddenly, she heard that there was a breakout of fire from a short-circuit. As ill news runs fast, within moments, panic spread throughout the factory. People screamed and rushed toward the exits in a state of confusion and fear.\nRina knew she had to stay calm. She quickly recalled the safety training she had received when she first joined the factory. She made her way to the emergency exit, but the crowd was so dense that it was difficult to move. She saw some of her co-workers struggling, and without thinking, she reached out to help them. Rina managed to guide a few of them toward the emergency stairwell, urging everyone to remain calm and not push or shove.\nMeanwhile, the fire was spreading rapidly, and thick smoke began to fill the air. The fire alarms were blaring, and the factory's emergency lights blinked on. Rina knew the workers must be evacuated immediately. She shouted instructions to others, urging them to follow the marked escape routes.\nThankfully, after what felt like an eternity, all the workers managed to get out safely. The fire brigade soon arrived and took control of the situation, putting out the flames. Although the factory was damaged, no lives were lost.\nRina felt a great sense of relief, but also a deep sense of responsibility. She had seen how quickly panic could spread, but also how important it was to stay calm in a crisis. She was proud of her quick thinking and the way everyone worked together to stay safe.\nThe incident left a lasting impression on Rina. She decided to join the factory’s safety committee to help improve emergency preparedness and ensure that such an event would never happen again. Rina’s courage and leadership that day made her a hero in the eyes of her fellow workers."

This information was just like a bolt from the blue to me. I did not expect it as I knew that, you had always been very careful and cautious about maintaining safe distance and wearing mask. Anyway, \"Prevention is better than cure\" does not always work. Sometimes, many unexpected (অপ্রত্যাশিত) things happen in our life and we must remain ready to face and fight them out. COVID-19 is now a pandemic (অতিমারী/বৈশ্বিক মহামারি); anybody may be infected with COVID-19 any time and anywhere. So, there is nothing to be worried. Many COVID-19 patients are being dehospitalized everyday after full recovery. Have patience and follow your doctor's advice. You are a conscious person and I am sure you will maintain your quarantine (সঙ্গনিরোধ) period properly. By the grace of the Almighty, you will come round very soon. Don't lose your mental strength. Courage and mental strength play a vital role to cure a COVID-19 patient. You know vaccination programme is going on across the world including our country. So, after getting fully recovered, don't make delay in getting vaccinated.\nWishing your earliest recovery.\nYour loving friend,\nSumon"
