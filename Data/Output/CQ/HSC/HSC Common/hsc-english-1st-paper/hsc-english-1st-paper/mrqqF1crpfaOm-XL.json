          "question": "",
          "explanation": "\n(a)\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines adolescence as the period of life between 10 and 19 years of age. This stage marks the transition from childhood to adulthood, characterized by significant physical, emotional, and social development. Adolescents experience rapid growth and undergo various changes that influence their health, behavior, and interactions with society.\n(b)\nAccording to the 2022 Bangladesh Census, the population of adolescents aged 10–14 is approximately 16.6 million, with 8.5 million boys and 7.8 million girls. For the 15–19 age group, there are about 16.5 million adolescents, comprising 8.1 million boys and 8.5 million girls. In total, adolescents make up about 28.8% of Bangladesh's population, with a near-equal distribution between boys and girls.\n(c)\nAdolescent girls in Bangladesh face several challenges\nChild Marriage : Approximately 51% of girls in Bangladesh are married before the age of 18, making it one of the highest rates globally.\nEducation : While enrollment rates for girls have improved, many still face barriers to completing secondary education, especially in rural areas.\nHealth Risks : Early pregnancies pose significant health risks, with many adolescent girls becoming mothers before reaching adulthood.\nViolence and Abuse : A significant number of adolescent girls experience physical or sexual violence, often within intimate relationships.\nThese issues hinder their development and access to opportunities, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.\n(d)\nIn Bangladesh, the legal age for marriage is 18 for girls and 21 for boys, as stipulated by the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 2017. However, the law includes provisions that allow for exceptions under certain circumstances, such as parental consent and court approval, which have been criticized for potentially undermining efforts to prevent child marriage.\n(e)\nWhile the legal age for marriage is 21 for boys in Bangladesh, readiness for marriage is influenced by various factors beyond age, including emotional maturity, financial stability, and societal expectations. Cultural norms often dictate that men should be established in their careers and capable of supporting a family before marriage. However, these expectations can vary widely across different communities and regions within the country."

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following text.\n\"The Negro is still not free. The life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination. The Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity. The Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land. So, we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.... I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created equal. I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood. I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today. I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of 'interposition' and 'nullification', that one day right down in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers.\"",

Here the speaker says that Black people are still not free because of unfair treatment. They live in poverty while others are rich. The Black feel like strangers in their own country. Even with these struggles, the speaker has a dream. He dreams that one day, everyone will be treated as equals. He hopes that former slaves' children and former slave owners' children will live peacefully together. He dreams that every state will become fair and that  his children will be judged by their character, not by their skin color. He also hopes that black and white  children in Alabama will become friends."

In 2011 , the rate came down to 1.95 % 1.95 \\% 1.95% . Then the increase occurred in 2012 and the rate was 2.20 % 2.20 \\% 2.20% . Again, in 2013 the population rate decreased and came down to 1.35 % 1.35 \\% 1.35% . The graph indicates that the highest rate was population growth rate in 2009 was alarming while the rate in 2013 was encouraging.\nFrom the graph, it is clear that population growth rate decreased rapidly and remarkably over time and within a span of 5 years the population decreased more than a half, i.e. from 2.73 in 2009 to 1.35 in 2013. This is really an encouraging feature of population growth in the context of Bangladesh. I think this has been made possible because of some effective measures taken by the govt. to control the growth of population, like the family planning programme of having no more than 2 children."

His deep love and reverence (সম্মান) for his mother instilled (সঞ্চার করা ) in him great power and courage. It took him an hour to reach the fountain. He filled the jar with water and began to walk fast towards his residence. It was 2 a.m. when he reached home. He was sorry to find his mother in deep sleep. But he stood still beside his mother's bed. He refrained from disturbing his mother and stood beside her bed with a glass of water. His mother awoke at dawn. She was moved to see her son's devotion to her. She earnestly prayed to Allah to bless her son with the highest spiritual honour. Allah granted her prayer and made Bayazid one of His greatest devotees."

All sorts of books such as fictions, novels, dramas, poems and books of medicine, engineering. politics, history, general knowledge, etc, were brought for display and sale in Ekushey Boi Mela. The book fair became crowdy specially in the evening. Both male and female customers gathered ( জড়ো হওয়া ) in Ekushey Boi Mela. Many writers also visited the fair. When I bought a novel from a stall, I noticed a big gathering in front of a particular stall which was for the writers. I went there and saw that Imdadul Haq Milan, a famous novelist, was present there and was giving autographs to the people over there. I also became interested in having his autograph but due to long line of people, I checked my wish. Afterwards, I enjoyed a cultural function. In fact, I enjoyed a lot visiting the Ekushey Boi Mela.\nNo more today. With much love.\nYours ever,\nEnum"
