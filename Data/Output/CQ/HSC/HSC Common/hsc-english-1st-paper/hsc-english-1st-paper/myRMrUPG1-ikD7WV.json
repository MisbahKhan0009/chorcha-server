          "explanation": "The pie chart displays the various sources of air pollution in a city, highlighting five key contributors. Vehicles are by far the most significant source, accounting for 60% of total air pollution. This indicates a heavy reliance on private and commercial transportation, possibly due to limited public transport infrastructure. Industry is the second-largest contributor at 18% , reflecting emissions from factories and manufacturing units. Power plants contribute 13% , suggesting that electricity generation—likely from fossil fuels—is another major pollutant. Waste disposal activities are responsible for 3% , while heating or using gas contributes nothing ( 0% ), showing negligible or highly controlled emissions in that category.\nThe disparity is stark: vehicles alone contribute more than all other sources combined, underscoring the urgent need for cleaner transport alternatives and stricter vehicular emission controls. In contrast, waste disposal and gas usage have a minimal impact, suggesting these are not major areas of concern. Targeted interventions in transport and industry could significantly improve air quality."

          "explanation": "Once a golden necklace was lost in a rich man's house. A few servants worked in that house. Naturally, it was suspected that any one of the servants had stolen the necklace. The rich man, unwilling to report the matter to the authorities, decided to resolve it himself.\nHe called all the servants together and calmly said, “I know one of you has taken the necklace, but I do not want to punish anyone unfairly. I will give you each a stick. All these sticks are of the same length. Take them home and bring them back tomorrow. The thief’s stick will grow by an inch overnight.”\nThe servants were surprised but took the sticks and returned to their rooms. That night, the guilty servant could not sleep. He was terrified that his stick would grow, revealing his crime. So, out of fear, he cut an inch off his stick, hoping to avoid suspicion.\nThe next day, all the servants returned with their sticks. The rich man collected them and carefully measured each one. One stick was shorter by exactly an inch.\nThe rich man smiled and turned to the servant holding the shorter stick. “You are the thief,” he said calmly. “The sticks were ordinary. None of them were going to grow. But your fear betrayed you.”\nCaught and ashamed, the servant confessed to the theft. The rich man, though saddened, forgave him but dismissed him from service, reminding everyone that honesty and trust are more valuable than gold.\nMoral: A guilty conscience will always reveal the truth."

Today, I want to talk to you about being a good citizen. It's really important, isn't it? A major duty of a good citizen is to be kind and helpful to others. We should always try to be nice to people and help them when they need it. Another responsibility is to follow the rules. That means, we should listen to our teachers, parents, and elders. We should also follow the laws of our country. Taking care of our environment is also part of being a good citizen. We can pick up trash, recycle, and save water to help keep our planet clean and healthy. If we all do these things, we can make our community and our world a better place for living. Let me know about your thoughts and ideas about it.\nYour ever,\nTahfim"

She told me to go away Now she is married to another man. My father lives very far away. I want to go to him, but he won't take me either. I begged him to send me some money so that I could buy a bus ticket. I am still waiting. He has not answered: The streets are now my home. Sometimes I find work. I used to collect trash and sell it to a vendor. I stopped doing that after I had a serious infection and a doctor told me to stay away from the trash dump. Once I worked for an ice-cream shop owner and sold ice-cream on the beach. But I got no money in return. The owner of the shop gave me something to eat, and let me sleep in his hut at night. The work was difficult and painful. The ice-cream box is quite heavy when it is full. I had to walk for hours, offering my ice-cream to whoever wanted to buy.. There were days when I could not even sell one ice-cream. In a way, I am lucky because I am alive. My friends who work sorting rubbish in dumps often suffer from serious diseases. One of them was recently killed after he fell into a hole that opened up in the pile of trash. Many of us work for 10 to 12 hours, and get so little in return that we can't even buy food.",

His mother sent him away, and his father, who lives far away, has not responded to his pleas for help. Amerigo survives by finding occasional work, such as collecting and selling trash, despite the health risks involved. He once worked for an ice-cream shop but received no money, only food and a place to sleep. Despite the hardships, Amerigo considers himself fortunate to be alive, unlike some of his friends who have suffered serious illnesses or even death from their work in trash dumps. Many like him work long hours for minimal pay, struggling to afford basic necessities like food."

He groomed himself up as a young man who earned success by dint of perseverance and commitment. When the Pakistan military began its genocide in Bangladesh, he joined the Liberation War and received military training at Camp Murtee located at the Himalayan foothills in India. The tall young man who carried himself with dignity and possessed remarkable traits of leadership became the ADC of General Ataul Goni, Osmani, the Commander in Chief of Bangladesh Armed Forces during the Liberation War. After Independence, Sheikh Kamal could, easily remain in Bangladesh Army and pass a secure life but he preferred to engage himself in country building and organizing the young forces to that end, Journalist Syed Ishtiaq Rezi in one of his columns 'Ekjon Sheikh Kamal' in Bangla Tribune rightly says that the unique qualities of Sheikh Kamal's character, especially his wholehearted involvement in sports and culture are never seen in any son or daughter of any President, Prime Minister or High Officials in Bangladesh.",

The poet compares such dreamless life with a 'broken-winged bird', which is unable to fly to reach its destination. In addition, the poet compares a life void of dream with a 'barren field' which is covered with frozen snow. Indeed, we must cherish a dream to be súccessful in life."
