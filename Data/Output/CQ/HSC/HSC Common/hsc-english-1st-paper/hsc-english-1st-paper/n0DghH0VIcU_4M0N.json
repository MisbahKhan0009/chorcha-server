      "uddipok": "Summarize the following text.\nMany adolescents face pressure to use alcohol, cigarettes, or other drugs and to initiate sexual relationships putting\nthemselves at high risk for intentional and unintentłonal injuries, unintended pregnancies, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Many also experience a wide range of adjustment and mental health problems. Behaviour patterns that are established during this period such as the use or avoidance of drugs and taking or abstaining from sexual risk can have long-lasting negative and positive effects on future health and well-being. As a result, adults have unique opportunities to influence adolescents. Adolescents are different both from young children and adults. Specifically, adolescents are not fully capable of understanding complex concepts, or the relationship between behaviour and consequences, or the degree of control they have or can have over health decision-making, including that related to sexual behaviour. This inability may make them particularly vulnerable to sexual exploitation and high-risk behaviours. Laws, customs, and practices may also affect adolescents differently than adults. For example, laws and policies often restrict adolescents' access to reproductive health information and services, especially when they are unmarried. In addition, even when services do exist, provider attitudes about adolescents often pose a significant barrier to the use of those services.",

          "explanation": "This passage highlights on the critical moments of adolescents, and the complexity and pressures they face during adolescence period. This phase is so critical since he/she has to face difficulties to adjust with them. They face life-destructing pressures and a wide range of mental and health problems. Also, this period is the shaper of his/her future with negative or positive effects. Adolescents are unable to perceive the complex concepts of life. Therefore, they become very vulnerable to high-risk behaviours and sexual exploitation. There are some restrictions and laws imposed on them to control or prevent them from going astray. As this phase is so critical for them, adults and other concerned authorities should be aware to guide them in the right direction."

      "uddipok": "Write a Summary of the following text:\nKuakata, locally known as Sagar Kannya (Daughter of the Sea) is a rare scenic spot located on the southernmost tip of Bangladesh. Kuakata in Latachapli union under Kalapara Police Station of Patuakhali district is about 30 km in length and 6 km in breadth. It is 70 km from Patuakhali district headquarters and 320 km from Dhaka. An excellent combination of the picturesque natural beauty, sandy beaches, blue sky and the shimmering expanse of water of the Bay of Bengal and the evergreen forest makes Kuakata a much sought after tourist destination. The name Kuakata takes its origin from the story of a 'Kua'-or well -dug on the sea shore by the early Rakhaine settlers for collecting drinking water. The Rakhaines had landed on Kuakata coast after being expelled from Arakan by the Mughals. Following the first well, it became a tradition to dig wells in the neighborhood of Rakhaine homesteads for fresh water supply.\nKuakata is one of the unique spots which allow a visitor to watch both the sunrise and the sunset from the beach. That perhaps makes Kuakata one of the world's most attractive beaches. The long and wide beach at Kuakata has a typical natural setting. This sandy beach slopes gently into the Bay and bathing there is as pleasant as is swimming or diving",

          "explanation": "Once, there lived a woodcutter. He was very poor but honest. He lived on the bank of a river near a jungle. He used to cut wood every day from the dense forest, selling it in the nearby village to make a meager living. Despite his hardships, he was content with his simple life and found joy in the beauty of nature surrounding him.\nOne day, while he was deep in the forest, he noticed something glimmering in the water. Curious, he approached the riverbank and discovered a beautiful golden axe submerged in the river. The woodcutter knew that this axe was not his, so he decided to leave it there. Suddenly, a fairy appeared before him, emerging from the water. She was impressed by his honesty and told him that she would reward him for his noble character.\nThe fairy asked the woodcutter if he wanted a new axe. He replied that he only needed a simple iron axe to continue his work. The fairy then gave him a sturdy, shining iron axe, and in return for his honesty, she granted him the ability to always find enough wood to sell and provide for his needs.\nFrom that day on, the woodcutter’s life changed for the better. He worked hard, but now he always had enough wood to sell and even started saving money. He was able to help others in his village, sharing his fortune with those less fortunate than himself.\nYears passed, and the woodcutter remained grateful for the fairy’s gift. He often visited the riverbank, where he first met her, to express his gratitude and remember the lesson of honesty and kindness. And so, the woodcutter lived happily, surrounded by the beauty of the forest and the friendship of his community."

From the graph, we cansee that the highest number of students come to college on bicycle which is about 45%. Then, the second position is claimed by the bus. Around 30% of the total students come to college by bus. On the other hand, the students who live near the college campus usually come to college on foot and their number is around 15%. Students of some rich families come to college by car. Their number is 10% of the total students. Hence, from the information of the graph, we can say that the communication system of the college is quite good. Again, we can say that most of the students reside near the college and so, they can come to college by bicycle, by bus, or on foot."
