In fact, he hated the courteous and polite people around him and thus he hated a few expressions like please, thank you, don't mention it etc. It troubled him a lot when people around were smiling to use these expressions.\nThe man considered all these expressions extravagant. So, he took a mission to invent a device that would steal these polite words. He calculated two benefits from his efforts. One, people won't use these words and thus he would be relieved of his apathy to people's polite behavior and the second one was earning money by selling the words stolen by the machine to somebody else. After a few months' hard work, he succeeded in inventing the machine he desired for a long long time. The machine started working and it gave the man complete satisfaction. People from their long practice would try to say thank you, so kind of you, my pleasure, don't mention it etc. as to appreciate others or express gratitude. But their tongue could not produce these words. The machine caught them. It resulted in a huge change in people's behaviour and attitudes. Gradually people became rough and tough, they lost their mental cool, they were blaming each other or fighting with each other. They became so selfish that they started refusing\nto help others without having a return for their service.\nThe man was terribly happy with his success, but he didn't count on two little girls of special needs. They had speech difficulty and so they used to communicate using sign language. Since the machine couldn't steal gestures, these girls continued their previous practices, of being kind and polite. Soon they realised the difference between them and other people, which led them to investigate the reason. After much toil, they could discover the wicked man, who was in a hide out on the top of a hill next to the sea with his enormous machine busy in capturing people's polite words and separating them into letters. The girls found the man taking a nap when they crept up to the machine and rewind it so that people could get back to their normal behaviour.\nAs a result, the machine exploded, scattering all the letters it had gathered into the sky. After some moments, the letters started coming down, like rain, and ended up in the sea. After that, everyone became polite and respectful to each other again. The anger and the arguments stopped, proving that good manners are very useful for keeping people together in a spirit of happiness.",

He was selfish and hated polite people and polite expressions. So, he secretly invented a device to steal these extravagant words and sell them. As a result, people could not use polite words. This changed people's behavior and attitudes greatly. People became ill-mannered and selfish. The wicked man became very happy. However, two little girls of special needs who used sign languages to communicate were still polite and kind, because the machine could not steal gestures. Noticing the difference with others, they investigated it. They discovered the machine, which was capturing polite words and separating them into letters. Seeing the man sleeping, the girls rewound the machine."

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following passage.\nWe spend money for different reasons. We buy foods, clothes or everyday essentials, pay for different services, entertain people, travel to places, help others in need or invest in business and thus spend money every day. In fact, spending is a part of our life.\nSpending may make us happy or unhappy depending on how and why we spend. When we spend money on things that we need and within our limit, it is good. When it becomes a compulsive behaviour, it makes life stressful. Unnecessary spending or spending beyond one's means has some bad effects. For one thing, it may lead to financial ruin or debt, and for another,. it may create unhappiness within families. People who overspend are never satisfied with what they have. They always rush for brands, fashion items, designer clothes, etc. Over a period of time, it becomes an addiction which may eventually create psychological problems.\nNowadays, consumer items are displayed in stores or in advertisements in ways that they create a feeling of immediate need for them. We are constantly tempted to buy, use or consume things even when we do not have a genuine need. We all need to be careful here. Salespersons often encourage customers to buy things by flattering them. 'This is a perfect match for you,' they would say. or 'You look so stunning in that dress.' Never forget, they say the same thing to most of their customers. It is better not to be persuaded by such words. They use these words to please the customers as the more a customer buys, the higher the profit is. Overspending is not only related to shopping, it applies to other activities as well such as eating out. Many people buy too many items to eat in a restaurant. They can eat only some of them and the rest are wasted: It's not a responsible attitude. We cannot simply waste food because we have money to buy it.\nYoung people in a shopping mall often look at an item on display afd think 'Oh I must buy this. I really need this.' They may not have the money needed. In their wallet. So, they use credit cards but using them is like taking a loan. If they are not careful, the loans increase which might lead them to a debt-trap.\nSometimes children insist on buying things that their parents cannot pay without stretching their budget. This may happen because the children's friends also have them. It's not fair as it becomes a burden for the parents.\nFinally, don't get trapped by the glossy advertisements on television or the Internet. You should rather ask yourself: \"Do I need this?\" The best way to control the habit of spending is not to think 'What I need', but 'Can I do without it?'",

          "explanation": "Money is spent every day for various reasons. Necessary expenses within our limit may make us happy. But unnecessary expenditure or spending money beyond our ability creates some problems and may lead to psychological problems. At present, consumer items are exhibited and advertised so attractively that we want to buy them immediately even without having a genuine need. Salespersons often flatter the customers to encourage them to buy more things. Buying more foods than requirements and their wastage means wastage of money. Children also make their parents fall in economic crisis by pressurizing them to buy unnecessary things. We should restrain this habit of overspending by asking ourselves if we can do without the thing we feel tempted to buy."

      "uddipok": "Write a summary of the following passage.\nEducation aims to bring about positive changes in our behavior. It helps us try to change our lives as well as the society we live in. Education that does not illuminate our minds or does not inspire us to work for the community is not complete at all. Education is not all about getting grades or receiving certificates- we use education to make life better. We are expected to apply the knowledge, skills and values that we learn in a classroom in our engagement with the world that lies outside. And we can do so in many different ways. Let's have a look at how education works. Learners' civic engagement is highly appreciated all over the world. Civic engagement means working to make a difference in the civic life (the public life of the citizens as constructed with private or personal life) of the community using knowledge, skills, values and motivation. Civic engagement promotes the quality of life in a community by contributing to the improvement of health and wellbeing of the people.\nCivically engaged individuals recognize themselves as members of a larger social community and are concerned about civic issues. They consider themselves responsible citizens who take action or raise their voices against injustice, discrimination and other forms of social ills.\nIn civic engagement, issues of public concern are crucial. Civic engagement includes individual or group activities to protect public interests and change the way the community values itself. For example, If you are protesting against any unjust decision of the local municipality such as raising taxes or an act that might work against people's interests, you are civically engaged and your action is considered a civic engagement. This protest can be done in different ways such as organizing rallies, collecting signatures, making human chains, writing petitions, etc. You can also help control traffic in front of a school, help children to cross the roads, work in a team to clean a park or a sea beach. You can also give some services to elderly people. These are all examples of civic engagement as what you do directly affects the community.\nWhen civic engagement is a part of an academic program, and the learners' engagement is assessed following a scale, then it is called service learning. It involves the application of knowledge and skills learned in the classroom and then making a complete plan of action 1.e. preparing a budget, starting the process of implementation, involving people and activating operational strategies.",

A civically engaged person works to create a difference in the civic life taking action or raising voice against injustice, discrimination and other forms of social ills. When we work for social welfare, we are civically engaged. Civic engagement may be individual or group activities. For example, we can raise voice against raising excessive taxes. This protest can be done by organising ralles, collecting signature, making human chains, etc. Learners engagement is evaluated by following a scale. Rnowledge and skills learned in the school is applied. in society for public welfare."
