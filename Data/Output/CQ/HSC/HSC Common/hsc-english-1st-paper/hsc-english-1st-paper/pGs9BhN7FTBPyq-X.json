          "explanation": "The pie chart displays the various sources of air pollution in a city, highlighting five key contributors. Vehicles are by far the most significant source, accounting for 60% of total air pollution. This indicates a heavy reliance on private and commercial transportation, possibly due to limited public transport infrastructure. Industry is the second-largest contributor at 18% , reflecting emissions from factories and manufacturing units. Power plants contribute 13% , suggesting that electricity generation—likely from fossil fuels—is another major pollutant. Waste disposal activities are responsible for 3% , while heating or using gas contributes nothing ( 0% ), showing negligible or highly controlled emissions in that category.\nThe disparity is stark: vehicles alone contribute more than all other sources combined, underscoring the urgent need for cleaner transport alternatives and stricter vehicular emission controls. In contrast, waste disposal and gas usage have a minimal impact, suggesting these are not major areas of concern. Targeted interventions in transport and industry could significantly improve air quality."

They were very prone to quarreling and used to quarrel among themselves all the time. They never worked together. The old farmer was very sad.at heart. He became very old. He thought he might die at any moment. He would not live long. What would his sons do after his death? If they quarreled with one another, they would spoil his property and be poor. He also thought of their future and at last he hit upon a plan. So, one day he ordered his sons to bring a bundle of sticks. The sons did so. He then ordered his eldest son to break the bundle. He tried again and again but failed. The second and the third sons did the same thing but in vain (বৃথা) The old man then ordered them to untie the bundle. They untied it accordingly. He told them to break the sticks one by one. This time they could easily break the sticks. Now the old man said to his sons, \"My dear sons, you see that you could not break the bundle. But when the bundle is untied, you could easily break it. So, remain united and then none will be able to do any harm to you.\""

Well, now I am giving a short description of it.\nBangladesh is known as the darling child of nature. Her scenic beauty is unique. Our rural areas in particular are too beautiful to describe. Here villages covered with numerous trees look very beautiful. And people here enjoy a comfortable life with shady and cold atmosphere. Here various species of beautiful birds on the branches of trees add to her beauty and their singing in sweet tones amuses us all day long. The hilly areas of our country where tribal people live are really beautiful. Moreover, she is enriched with many attractive (আকর্ষণীয়)places like Cox's Bazar sea beach, the mangrove forest of the Sundarbans, the Shat Gambuj Mosque and the mazar of Khan Jahan Ali at Bagerhat, Mahasthangarh the oldest city of Bangladesh and so many places like these ones. Some of these places are known as pleasure seekers' paradise. The country is full of rivers canals, etc. connected with one another. Our climate is moderate, and our people are simple and peace-loving.\nNo more today. Please, write to me about your country and your new living place (15 Downing Street, UK).\nThanks,\nSakib"

      "uddipok": "Write a summary of the following passage.\nEducation aims to bring about positive changes in our behavior. It helps us try to change our lives as well as the society we live in. Education that does not illuminate our minds or does not inspire us to work for the community is not complete at all. Education is not all about getting grades or receiving certificates- we use education to make life better. We are expected to apply the knowledge, skills and values that we learn in a classroom in our engagement with the world that lies outside. And we can do so in many different ways. Let's have a look at how education works. Learners' civic engagement is highly appreciated all over the world. Civic engagement means working to make a difference in the civic life (the public life of the citizens as constructed with private or personal life) of the community using knowledge, skills, values and motivation. Civic engagement promotes the quality of life in a community by contributing to the improvement of health and wellbeing of the people.\nCivically engaged individuals recognize themselves as members of a larger social community and are concerned about civic issues. They consider themselves responsible citizens who take action or raise their voices against injustice, discrimination and other forms of social ills.\nIn civic engagement, issues of public concern are crucial. Civic engagement includes individual or group activities to protect public interests and change the way the community values itself. For example, If you are protesting against any unjust decision of the local municipality such as raising taxes or an act that might work against people's interests, you are civically engaged and your action is considered a civic engagement. This protest can be done in different ways such as organizing rallies, collecting signatures, making human chains, writing petitions, etc. You can also help control traffic in front of a school, help children to cross the roads, work in a team to clean a park or a sea beach. You can also give some services to elderly people. These are all examples of civic engagement as what you do directly affects the community.\nWhen civic engagement is a part of an academic program, and the learners' engagement is assessed following a scale, then it is called service learning. It involves the application of knowledge and skills learned in the classroom and then making a complete plan of action 1.e. preparing a budget, starting the process of implementation, involving people and activating operational strategies.",

(One is done for you.)\nAt daylight I was half wakened by the sound of chopping. Again it was so even in texture that went back to sleep. When I left my bed in the cool morning, the boy had come and gone, and a stack of kindling was neat against the cabin wall. He came arter school in the afternoon and worked until time to return to the orphanage. His name was Jerry ... he had been at the orphanage since he was four. I could picture him at four. with the same grave gray-blue eyes and the same independence? No, the word that comes to me is \"integrity\". ‥ It is bedded on courage, but it is more than brave. It is honest, but it is more than honesty. The ax handle broke one day. Jerry said the woodshop at the orphanage would repair it. I brought money to pay for the job and he refused it. \"I'll pay for it,\" he said. \"I broke it. I brought the ax down.careless.\" \"But no one hits accurately every time,\" I told him. \"The fault was in the wood of the handle. I'll see the man from whom I bought it.\" It was only then that he would take the money. He was standing back of his own carelessness. He was a free-will agent and he chose to do careful work, and if he failed, he took the responsibility without subterfuge.\nChopping wood in the morning→\n2. →\n3.→\n4.→\n5.\n6.",

      "uddipok": "Read the following text and make a flow chart showing the features of dream. (One is done for you.)\nDreams have fascinated philosophers for thousands of years, but only recently have dreams been subjected to empirical research and scientific study. Chances are that you've often found yourself puzzling over the content of a dream, or perhaps you've' wondered why you dream at all. First, let's start by answering a basic question: What is a dream? A dream can include any of the images, thoughts and emotions that are experienced during sleep. Dreams. can be extraordinarily vivid or very vague; filled with joyful emotions or frightening images, focused and understandable or unclear and confusing.\nWhy do we dream? What purpose do dreams serve? While many theories have been proposed no consensus has emerged. Considering the time. we spend in a dreaming state, the fact that researchers do not yet understand the purpose of dreams may seem baffling. However, it is important to consider that science is still unraveling the exact purpose and function of sleep itself: Some researchers suggest that dreams serve no real purpose, while others believe that dreaming is essential to mental, emotional and physical well-being.\nNext, let's learn more about some of the most prominent dream theories. Consistent with the psychoanalytic perspective, Sigmund Freud's theory of dreams suggests that dreams are a representation of subconscious desires, thoughts and motivations. According to Freud, people are driven by aggressive and sexual instincts that are repressed from conscious awareness. While these thoughts are not consciously expressed, they find their way into our awareness via dreams. In his famous book The Interpretation of Dreams (1899). Freud wrote that dreams are \"..... disguised fulfilments of repressed wishes.\"\nFull of thoughts, images and emotions→\n2.→\n3.→\n4.→\n5.→\n6.",
