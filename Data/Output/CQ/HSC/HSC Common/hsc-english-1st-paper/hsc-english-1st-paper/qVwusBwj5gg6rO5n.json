He formally left public life in June 2004 before his 86th birthday. But he remained one of the world's most revered public figures, combining celebrity sparkle with an unwavering message of freedom, respect and human rights.\nThe years Mandela spent behind bars made him the world's most celebrated political prisoner and a leader of mythic stature for millions of black South Africans and other oppressed people far beyond his country's borders. Charged with capital offences in the 1963 Rivonia Trial, his statement from the dock was his political testimony. \"During my lifetime I have fought against white domination and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities,\" he told the court. Friends adored Mandela. And people lauded his humanity, kindness and dignity\n1. An advocate of human dignity\n→ 2. → 3. → 4. → 5. → 6.",

      "uddipok": "Read the following text and make a flow chart showing the features of dream. (One is done for you.)\nDreams have fascinated philosophers for thousands of years, but only recently have dreams been subjected to empirical research and scientific study. Chances are that you've often found yourself puzzling over the content of a dream, or perhaps you've' wondered why you dream at all. First, let's start by answering a basic question: What is a dream? A dream can include any of the images, thoughts and emotions that are experienced during sleep. Dreams. can be extraordinarily vivid or very vague; filled with joyful emotions or frightening images, focused and understandable or unclear and confusing.\nWhy do we dream? What purpose do dreams serve? While many theories have been proposed no consensus has emerged. Considering the time. we spend in a dreaming state, the fact that researchers do not yet understand the purpose of dreams may seem baffling. However, it is important to consider that science is still unraveling the exact purpose and function of sleep itself: Some researchers suggest that dreams serve no real purpose, while others believe that dreaming is essential to mental, emotional and physical well-being.\nNext, let's learn more about some of the most prominent dream theories. Consistent with the psychoanalytic perspective, Sigmund Freud's theory of dreams suggests that dreams are a representation of subconscious desires, thoughts and motivations. According to Freud, people are driven by aggressive and sexual instincts that are repressed from conscious awareness. While these thoughts are not consciously expressed, they find their way into our awareness via dreams. In his famous book The Interpretation of Dreams (1899). Freud wrote that dreams are \"..... disguised fulfilments of repressed wishes.\"\nFull of thoughts, images and emotions→\n2.→\n3.→\n4.→\n5.→\n6.",

          "explanation": "The bar graph illustrates the steady increase in the number of internet users in Bangladesh from 2014 to 2019. The graph shows that in 2014, there were around 40 million users, which increased to approximately 60 million by 2015. Then, the number of users suddenly decreased and reached 50 million in 2016. Only this particular year marks a decrease in the number of users. Then, a significant surge occurred in 2017 and the number of internet users jumped to 70 million. This marks an increase highlighting a rapid growth in internet accessibility and usage. The number of users remained same in 2018. Finally, in 2019, the number of internet users took another jump and turned into 80 million in total. Analysing the graph, we find that within five years, the number of internet users in Bangladesh increased significantly, making it double. It is a clear indication that during this period, the country's digital infrastructure improved significantly. It also shows that people of Bangladesh are. getting accustomed to the modern technologies."

          "explanation": "Once a golden necklace was lost in a rich man's house. A few servants worked in that house. Naturally, it was suspected that any one of the servants had stolen the necklace. The rich man, unwilling to report the matter to the authorities, decided to resolve it himself.\nHe called all the servants together and calmly said, “I know one of you has taken the necklace, but I do not want to punish anyone unfairly. I will give you each a stick. All these sticks are of the same length. Take them home and bring them back tomorrow. The thief’s stick will grow by an inch overnight.”\nThe servants were surprised but took the sticks and returned to their rooms. That night, the guilty servant could not sleep. He was terrified that his stick would grow, revealing his crime. So, out of fear, he cut an inch off his stick, hoping to avoid suspicion.\nThe next day, all the servants returned with their sticks. The rich man collected them and carefully measured each one. One stick was shorter by exactly an inch.\nThe rich man smiled and turned to the servant holding the shorter stick. “You are the thief,” he said calmly. “The sticks were ordinary. None of them were going to grow. But your fear betrayed you.”\nCaught and ashamed, the servant confessed to the theft. The rich man, though saddened, forgave him but dismissed him from service, reminding everyone that honesty and trust are more valuable than gold.\nMoral: A guilty conscience will always reveal the truth."

          "explanation": "Dear Jewel,\nI hope you are doing well. It’s always nice to see how active and enthusiastic you are on Facebook. Your passion for staying connected and sharing content is really admirable. However, I wanted to talk to you about something important.\nLately, I’ve noticed that you sometimes share information without verifying whether it’s true or not. I know your intentions are good, but sharing misinformation—even unknowingly—can have serious consequences. It can mislead people, create unnecessary panic, and sometimes even hurt someone’s reputation or feelings.\nSocial media is a powerful platform. That’s why it’s our responsibility to use it wisely. Before posting anything, especially news or claims, it's always better to double-check the facts from reliable sources. Even a quick search can help us make sure we’re not spreading anything false.\nI hope you take this advice in the right spirit. I truly value our friendship and just wanted to remind you how important it is to think before we post.\nTake care, and keep spreading positivity—just with a bit more caution!\nYour friend, Miraz\n"
