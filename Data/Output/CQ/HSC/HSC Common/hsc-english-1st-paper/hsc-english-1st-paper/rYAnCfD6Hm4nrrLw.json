          "explanation": "The bar graph illustrates the steady increase in the number of internet users in Bangladesh from 2014 to 2019. The graph shows that in 2014, there were around 40 million users, which increased to approximately 60 million by 2015. Then, the number of users suddenly decreased and reached 50 million in 2016. Only this particular year marks a decrease in the number of users. Then, a significant surge occurred in 2017 and the number of internet users jumped to 70 million. This marks an increase highlighting a rapid growth in internet accessibility and usage. The number of users remained same in 2018. Finally, in 2019, the number of internet users took another jump and turned into 80 million in total. Analysing the graph, we find that within five years, the number of internet users in Bangladesh increased significantly, making it double. It is a clear indication that during this period, the country's digital infrastructure improved significantly. It also shows that people of Bangladesh are. getting accustomed to the modern technologies."

          "explanation": "Innovation of the Innovative Boy\n. There was a boy who hailed from an obscure background. But he was brilliant, diligent and innovative. He belonged to a village where there was no electricity. During summer, the atmosphere of the village was hot and humid. The villagers were even suffering from the high temperature at home. They were becoming sick due to hot weather. Some of them even died of heat stroke. The boy, however, was thinking of an idea how to get rid of the heat. He came to know from a physics teacher of his school that the gas cools when it expands quickly. So, he thought of making an air cooler out of plastic bottles for his own house. So, he collected some plastic bottles and cut them into half. Then, he mounted them on a board. After that, he placed the board over a window, with the bottlenecks facing towards the inner side of the house. As a result, the change in pressure that occurred when air entered the wider part of the bottle and came out through the bottleneck cooled the air. That's how he successfully made the air cooler out of the plastic bottles. When the villagers found it effective, they requested the boy to make the cooler for them too. As the raw plastic bottles were easily available, the cooler could be made easily and it was cheap as well. In this way, the boy could reduce the sufferings of the village and also earn some money."

But I have heard that you are not keeping good company around you. It is indeed a bad news for me.\nIn your last annual exam, you did not perform very well. Your marks were visibly poor. I believe the main reason for this demotion is the bad company you are keeping. With the people you are getting close to these days are not attentive to studies. Studying hard and gaining knowledge are not their concerns. Also, some of them are heavily addicted to smoking. Some of them do not go to the school on a regular basis. If you keep on mixing with them, it will affect your studies further. You will also develop bad habits like smoking, bunking classes, being irregular in the classes and so on. So, I would request you to stay away from evil company. No more today. Write to me soon.\nYours ever, Tahsin"

(No. 1 has been done for you.)\nThe history of Bengal is the history of a people who have repeatedly made their highways red with their blood. We shed blood in 1952; even though we were the victors in the elections of 1954, we could not form a government then. In 1958, Ayub Khan declared Martial Law to enslave us for the next ten years. In 1966 when we launched the Six Point movement our boys were shot dead on 7 June. When after the movement of 1969 Ayub Khan fell from power and Yahya Khan assumed the reins of the government he declared that he would give us a constitution and restore democracy; we listened to him then. A lot has happened since and elections have taken place.\nI've met President Yahya Khan. I've made a request to him not only on behalf of Bengal but also as the leader of the party which has the majority in Pakistan; I said to him: \"You must hold the session of the National Assembly on 15 February.\" But he did not listen to me. He listened to Mr. Bhutto instead. At first, he said that the meeting would take place in the first week of March. We said, \"Fine, we will be taking our seats in the Assembly then.\" I said we would carry out our discussions in the Assembly.\n1.Bloodshed in 1952→\n2.→\n3.→\n4.→\n5.→\n6.",

      "uddipok": "Write a summary of the following passage.\nEducation aims to bring about positive changes in our behavior. It helps us try to change our lives as well as the society we live in. Education that does not illuminate our minds or does not inspire us to work for the community is not complete at all. Education is not all about getting grades or receiving certificates- we use education to make life better. We are expected to apply the knowledge, skills and values that we learn in a classroom in our engagement with the world that lies outside. And we can do so in many different ways. Let's have a look at how education works. Learners' civic engagement is highly appreciated all over the world. Civic engagement means working to make a difference in the civic life (the public life of the citizens as constructed with private or personal life) of the community using knowledge, skills, values and motivation. Civic engagement promotes the quality of life in a community by contributing to the improvement of health and wellbeing of the people.\nCivically engaged individuals recognize themselves as members of a larger social community and are concerned about civic issues. They consider themselves responsible citizens who take action or raise their voices against injustice, discrimination and other forms of social ills.\nIn civic engagement, issues of public concern are crucial. Civic engagement includes individual or group activities to protect public interests and change the way the community values itself. For example, If you are protesting against any unjust decision of the local municipality such as raising taxes or an act that might work against people's interests, you are civically engaged and your action is considered a civic engagement. This protest can be done in different ways such as organizing rallies, collecting signatures, making human chains, writing petitions, etc. You can also help control traffic in front of a school, help children to cross the roads, work in a team to clean a park or a sea beach. You can also give some services to elderly people. These are all examples of civic engagement as what you do directly affects the community.\nWhen civic engagement is a part of an academic program, and the learners' engagement is assessed following a scale, then it is called service learning. It involves the application of knowledge and skills learned in the classroom and then making a complete plan of action 1.e. preparing a budget, starting the process of implementation, involving people and activating operational strategies.",

A civically engaged person works to create a difference in the civic life taking action or raising voice against injustice, discrimination and other forms of social ills. When we work for social welfare, we are civically engaged. Civic engagement may be individual or group activities. For example, we can raise voice against raising excessive taxes. This protest can be done by organising ralles, collecting signature, making human chains, etc. Learners engagement is evaluated by following a scale.

      "uddipok": "Read the following text and make a flow chart showing the features of dream. (One is done for you.)\nDreams have fascinated philosophers for thousands of years, but only recently have dreams been subjected to empirical research and scientific study. Chances are that you've often found yourself puzzling over the content of a dream, or perhaps you've' wondered why you dream at all. First, let's start by answering a basic question: What is a dream? A dream can include any of the images, thoughts and emotions that are experienced during sleep. Dreams. can be extraordinarily vivid or very vague; filled with joyful emotions or frightening images, focused and understandable or unclear and confusing.\nWhy do we dream? What purpose do dreams serve? While many theories have been proposed no consensus has emerged. Considering the time. we spend in a dreaming state, the fact that researchers do not yet understand the purpose of dreams may seem baffling. However, it is important to consider that science is still unraveling the exact purpose and function of sleep itself: Some researchers suggest that dreams serve no real purpose, while others believe that dreaming is essential to mental, emotional and physical well-being.\nNext, let's learn more about some of the most prominent dream theories. Consistent with the psychoanalytic perspective, Sigmund Freud's theory of dreams suggests that dreams are a representation of subconscious desires, thoughts and motivations. According to Freud, people are driven by aggressive and sexual instincts that are repressed from conscious awareness. While these thoughts are not consciously expressed, they find their way into our awareness via dreams. In his famous book The Interpretation of Dreams (1899). Freud wrote that dreams are \"..... disguised fulfilments of repressed wishes.\"\nFull of thoughts, images and emotions→\n2.→\n3.→\n4.→\n5.→\n6.",
