Education that does not illuminate our minds or does not inspire us to work for the community is not complete at all. Education is not all about getting grades or receiving certificates- we use education to make life better. We are expected to apply the knowledge, skills and values that we learn in a classroom in our engagement with the world that lies outside. And we can do so in many different ways. Let's have a look at how education works. Learners' civic engagement is highly appreciated all over the world. Civic engagement means working to make a difference in the civic life (the public life of the citizens as constructed with private or personal life) of the community using knowledge, skills, values and motivation. Civic engagement promotes the quality of life in a community by contributing to the improvement of health and wellbeing of the people.\nCivically engaged individuals recognize themselves as members of a larger social community and are concerned about civic issues. They consider themselves responsible citizens who take action or raise their voices against injustice, discrimination and other forms of social ills.\nIn civic engagement, issues of public concern are crucial. Civic engagement includes individual or group activities to protect public interests and change the way the community values itself. For example, If you are protesting against any unjust decision of the local municipality such as raising taxes or an act that might work against people's interests, you are civically engaged and your action is considered a civic engagement. This protest can be done in different ways such as organizing rallies, collecting signatures, making human chains, writing petitions, etc. You can also help control traffic in front of a school, help children to cross the roads, work in a team to clean a park or a sea beach. You can also give some services to elderly people. These are all examples of civic engagement as what you do directly affects the community.\nWhen civic engagement is a part of an academic program, and the learners' engagement is assessed following a scale, then it is called service learning. It involves the application of knowledge and skills learned in the classroom and then making a complete plan of action 1.e. preparing a budget, starting the process of implementation, involving people and activating operational strategies.",

He groomed himself up as a young man who earned success by dint of perseverance and commitment. When the Pakistan military began its genocide in Bangladesh, he joined the Liberation War and received military training at Camp Murtee located at the Himalayan foothills in India. The tall young man who carried himself with dignity and possessed remarkable traits of leadership became the ADC of General Ataul Goni, Osmani, the Commander in Chief of Bangladesh Armed Forces during the Liberation War. After Independence, Sheikh Kamal could, easily remain in Bangladesh Army and pass a secure life but he preferred to engage himself in country building and organizing the young forces to that end, Journalist Syed Ishtiaq Rezi in one of his columns 'Ekjon Sheikh Kamal' in Bangla Tribune rightly says that the unique qualities of Sheikh Kamal's character, especially his wholehearted involvement in sports and culture are never seen in any son or daughter of any President, Prime Minister or High Officials in Bangladesh.",

          "explanation": "The poem underscores the importance of holding or fostering a dream since life without dream is meaningless and it loses its true purpose. The poet compares such dreamless life with a 'broken-winged bird', which is unable to fly to reach its destination. In addition, the poet compares a life void of dream with a 'barren field' which is covered with frozen snow. Indeed, we must cherish a dream to be súccessful in life."

          "explanation": "Once, there lived a woodcutter. He was very poor but honest. He lived on the bank of a river near a jungle. He used to cut wood every day from the dense forest, selling it in the nearby village to make a meager living. Despite his hardships, he was content with his simple life and found joy in the beauty of nature surrounding him.\nOne day, while he was deep in the forest, he noticed something glimmering in the water. Curious, he approached the riverbank and discovered a beautiful golden axe submerged in the river. The woodcutter knew that this axe was not his, so he decided to leave it there. Suddenly, a fairy appeared before him, emerging from the water. She was impressed by his honesty and told him that she would reward him for his noble character.\nThe fairy asked the woodcutter if he wanted a new axe. He replied that he only needed a simple iron axe to continue his work. The fairy then gave him a sturdy, shining iron axe, and in return for his honesty, she granted him the ability to always find enough wood to sell and provide for his needs.\nFrom that day on, the woodcutter’s life changed for the better. He worked hard, but now he always had enough wood to sell and even started saving money. He was able to help others in his village, sharing his fortune with those less fortunate than himself.\nYears passed, and the woodcutter remained grateful for the fairy’s gift. He often visited the riverbank, where he first met her, to express his gratitude and remember the lesson of honesty and kindness. And so, the woodcutter lived happily, surrounded by the beauty of the forest and the friendship of his community."
