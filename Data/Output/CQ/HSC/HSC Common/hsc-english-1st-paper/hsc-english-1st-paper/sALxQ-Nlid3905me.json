      "uddipok": "Summarize the following text.\nValentina Tereshkova was born in a village, in Central Russia on 6 March 1937. Her father was a tractor driver and her mother worked in a textile plant. At the age of eight she began her schooling but did not enjoy it much. She left the school within a few years. Afterwards she completed her education through distance learning. She became interested in parachuting from a young age, and trained in skydiving at the local Aeroclub, making her first jump at age 22 on 21 May 1959. It was her expertise in skydiving that led to her selection as a cosmonaut.After the flight of Yuri Gagarin, the first human being to travel to outer space in April 1961, the Soviet Union decided to send a woman in space. On 16 February 1962, \"proletaria\" Valentina Tereshkova was selected for this project from among more than four hundred applicants. Tereshkova had to undergo a series of training that included weightless flights, isolation tests, centrifuge tests, rocket theory, spacecraft engineering, 120 parachute jumps and pilot training in MiG-15UTI jet fighters. Since the successful launch of the spacecraft Vostok-5 on 14 June 1963, Tereshkova began preparing for her own flight. On the morning of 16 June 1963, Tereshkova and her. back-up cosmonaut Solovyova were dressed in space-suits and taken to the space shuttle launch pad by a bus. After completing her communication and life support checks, she was sealed inside Vostok-6. Finishing a two-\nhour countdown, Vostok-6 launched faultlessly. Although Tereshkova experienced nausea and physical discomfort for much of the flight, she orbited the earth 48 times and spent almost three days in space. With a single flight, she logged more flight time than the combined times of all American astronauts who had flown before that date. Tereshkova also maintained a flight log and took photographs of the horizon, which were later used to identify aerosol layers within the atmosphere. Vostok-6 was the final Vostok flight and was launched two days after Vostok-5, which carried Valary Bykovsky into a similar orbit for five days, landing three hours after Tereshkova. The two vessels approached each other within 5 kilometers at one point, and from space Tereshkova communicated with Bykovsky and the Soviet leader Khrushchev by radio.",

          "explanation": "Valentina Tereshkova, born in 1937, grew up in Central Russia. She left school early but continued education through distance learning. Passionate about parachuting, she trained extensively and made her first jump at 22. Selected as a cosmonaut in 1962, she underwent rigorous training. On June 16, 1963, she boarded Vostok-6, becoming the first woman in space. Despite feeling discomfort, she orbited Earth 48 times in nearly three days, contributing valuable data. Her flight time surpassed combined American astronaut times. Tereshkova's achievements marked a significant milestone in space exploration."

      "uddipok": "Read the following text and make a flow chart showing the ideas of a peace movement. (No. 1 has been done for you.)\nA peace movement is a social movement that seeks to achieve ideals such as the ending of a particular war (or all wars), minimize inter-human violence in a particular place or type of situation, including ban of guns, and is often linked to the goal of achieving world peace. Means to achieve these ends include advocacy of pacifism, non-violent resistance, diplomacy, boycotts, demonstrations, peace camps; supporting anti-war political candidates and banning guns, creating open government, direct democracy; supporting people who expose war-crimes or conspiracies to create wars, and making laws. Different organizations involved in peace movements may have some diverse goals, but one common goal is sustainability of peace.\nEnding of war →\n2→\n3→\n4→\n5→\n6",

Through them the people should offer their intellectual hospitality, their wealth of mind to others, and earn their proud right in return to receive gifts from the rest of the world. But in the whole length and breadth of India there is not a single university established in the modern time where a foreign or an Indian student can properly be acquainted with the best products of the Indian mind. For that we have to cross the sea, and knock at the doors of France and Germany. Educational institutions in our country are India's alms-bowl of knowledge; they lower our intellectual self-respect; they encourage us to make a foolish display of decorations composed of borrowed feathers.",

Rather, they should be the means for people to offer their intellectual hospitality and worth of mind to others, and obtain gifts from the rest of the world. Unfortunately, India lacks such university. So, Indian students are to knock at the doors of the European universities.

          "explanation": "Climate change represents one of the most critical global challenges of our time, driven by a complex interplay of factors, including carbon emissions, volcanic eruptions, and solar radiation. However, it’s the impact of human activities, particularly fossil fuel combustion, deforestation, and vehicular pollution, that has significantly accelerated this phenomenon. These activities have resulted in more frequent and severe extreme weather events, posing a grave threat to the planet’s biodiversity.\nForests, which play a vital role in carbon absorption, are facing the risk of mass extinctions. The polar regions, crucial for regulating Earth’s climate, are particularly vulnerable, with many species at the brink of extinction. Erratic rainfall patterns have led to catastrophic events like floods and droughts, disrupting water systems and impacting communities.\nVarious species, from polar bears struggling to find food due to melting ice caps to tigers facing habitat loss, are in jeopardy due to changing climates.\nTo address this monumental challenge, immediate and concerted efforts are paramount. It involves reducing carbon emissions through transitioning to cleaner energy sources, promoting sustainable practices in agriculture and land use, and adhering to international agreements such as the Paris Agreement.\nIndividuals, communities, governments, and businesses all have roles to play in combatting climate change. Raising awareness, adopting greener technologies, and advocating for responsible policies are crucial steps towards mitigating the impact of climate change. The preservation of Earth’s climate is not just an environmental imperative but a collective responsibility that requires global cooperation to ensure a sustainable and habitable future for generations to come."

          "explanation": "\nOnce there lived a happy cobbler who passed his day working and singing from morning to night. His firm belief was that money cannot bring happiness. Happiness lies in contentment. A rich neighbor of his was a banker who one day came and said to him,” How much a year do you earn?” The cobbler replied, “I don’t know and I never think in that way as I live from hand to mouth.” The banker said, \"I am very sorry for your poverty. You should try to change your fortune.” The cobbler laughed and said, \"I am happy with what I can earn daily.” The next day the banker came again and said, “Look, my friend! I want to drive away your distress. Take these thousand pounds, keep it carefully and use it in time of need.\"\nThe cobbler became very much surprised having the large amount. He had never seen so much money at a time in his life before. At first, he could not think where he should hide the money for safety. Then, he dug a hole in his hut and buried it.\nAt night, a new thinking crossed over his mind, “someone might steal my money.” As a result, he could not sleep at all.\n\n\nNext few days, he could neither do any work nor sleep at night for the thinking of money. At last, he could realize that the money had snatched away his mental peace and happiness. So, one morning he went to the banker’s house and returned the money. From then, he could pass his days with singing and great happiness as before.\nMoral Of the Story: Money cannot bring happiness. Happiness lies in the self contentment.\n"
