          "explanation": "National per capita income of some of the Asian countries\nHere the graph represents the national per capita income of some of the Asian countries in 2010. According to the information in the graph per capita income in Vietnam is US\\$1110. In India per capita income, as the graph shows, is US\\$1340. Per capita income in Sri Lanka shows itself to be US\\$2240. At last comes the information about Bangladesh where per capita income is shown to be US\\$700 only. Thus in respect of amount of the per capita income of the above-mentioned countries, Sri Lanka occupies the first position, India second, Vietnam third and Bangladesh last position. It is very sad that the national per capita income of Bangladesh is very low. People of Bangladesh should endeavour (চেষ্টা করা) hard to increase their per capita income. Otherwise, we won't be able to keep pace with the developed countries. of the world and we won't be able to raise our head in the world as a developed country."

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following text.\nMany adolescents face pressure to use alcohol, cigarettes, or other drugs and to initiate sexual relationships putting\nthemselves at high risk for intentional and unintentłonal injuries, unintended pregnancies, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Many also experience a wide range of adjustment and mental health problems. Behaviour patterns that are established during this period such as the use or avoidance of drugs and taking or abstaining from sexual risk can have long-lasting negative and positive effects on future health and well-being. As a result, adults have unique opportunities to influence adolescents. Adolescents are different both from young children and adults. Specifically, adolescents are not fully capable of understanding complex concepts, or the relationship between behaviour and consequences, or the degree of control they have or can have over health decision-making, including that related to sexual behaviour. This inability may make them particularly vulnerable to sexual exploitation and high-risk behaviours. Laws, customs, and practices may also affect adolescents differently than adults. For example, laws and policies often restrict adolescents' access to reproductive health information and services, especially when they are unmarried. In addition, even when services do exist, provider attitudes about adolescents often pose a significant barrier to the use of those services.",

          "explanation": "This passage highlights on the critical moments of adolescents, and the complexity and pressures they face during adolescence period. This phase is so critical since he/she has to face difficulties to adjust with them. They face life-destructing pressures and a wide range of mental and health problems. Also, this period is the shaper of his/her future with negative or positive effects. Adolescents are unable to perceive the complex concepts of life. Therefore, they become very vulnerable to high-risk behaviours and sexual exploitation. There are some restrictions and laws imposed on them to control or prevent them from going astray. As this phase is so critical for them, adults and other concerned authorities should be aware to guide them in the right direction."

These songs are also about social inequality and poverty, about the material world and the supernatural. Mystical songs have been composed using the metaphors of rivers and boats. Since the country is basically riverine, the Bhatiyali forms an important genre of folk music. Nature plays a role in providing the content and rhythm of folk music. The folk music of Bangladesh varies from region to region, reflecting changes in the natural environment and the dialects people use. Thus there are the northern Bhawaiya, the eastern Bhatiyali and the southwestern Baul songs.\nSongs reflecting rural and riverine life→\n2→\n3→\n4→\n5→\n6",
