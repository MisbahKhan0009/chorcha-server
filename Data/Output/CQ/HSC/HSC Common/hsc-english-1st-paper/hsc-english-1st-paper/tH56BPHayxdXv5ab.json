          "explanation": "The pie chart displays the various sources of air pollution in a city, highlighting five key contributors. Vehicles are by far the most significant source, accounting for 60% of total air pollution. This indicates a heavy reliance on private and commercial transportation, possibly due to limited public transport infrastructure. Industry is the second-largest contributor at 18% , reflecting emissions from factories and manufacturing units. Power plants contribute 13% , suggesting that electricity generation—likely from fossil fuels—is another major pollutant. Waste disposal activities are responsible for 3% , while heating or using gas contributes nothing ( 0% ), showing negligible or highly controlled emissions in that category.\nThe disparity is stark: vehicles alone contribute more than all other sources combined, underscoring the urgent need for cleaner transport alternatives and stricter vehicular emission controls. In contrast, waste disposal and gas usage have a minimal impact, suggesting these are not major areas of concern. Targeted interventions in transport and industry could significantly improve air quality."

          "explanation": "Once, there lived a woodcutter. He was very poor but honest. He lived on the bank of a river near a jungle. He used to cut wood every day from the dense forest, selling it in the nearby village to make a meager living. Despite his hardships, he was content with his simple life and found joy in the beauty of nature surrounding him.\nOne day, while he was deep in the forest, he noticed something glimmering in the water. Curious, he approached the riverbank and discovered a beautiful golden axe submerged in the river. The woodcutter knew that this axe was not his, so he decided to leave it there. Suddenly, a fairy appeared before him, emerging from the water. She was impressed by his honesty and told him that she would reward him for his noble character.\nThe fairy asked the woodcutter if he wanted a new axe. He replied that he only needed a simple iron axe to continue his work. The fairy then gave him a sturdy, shining iron axe, and in return for his honesty, she granted him the ability to always find enough wood to sell and provide for his needs.\nFrom that day on, the woodcutter’s life changed for the better. He worked hard, but now he always had enough wood to sell and even started saving money. He was able to help others in his village, sharing his fortune with those less fortunate than himself.\nYears passed, and the woodcutter remained grateful for the fairy’s gift. He often visited the riverbank, where he first met her, to express his gratitude and remember the lesson of honesty and kindness. And so, the woodcutter lived happily, surrounded by the beauty of the forest and the friendship of his community."

          "explanation": "Dear Clara,\nI hope this letter finds you well. It was delightful to hear from you! Thank you for your interest in Bangladesh; I'd be happy to share more about my country with you.\nBangladesh is a beautiful country located in South Asia, bordered by India to the west, north, and east, with Myanmar (Burma) lying to the southeast. One of the most fascinating aspects of Bangladesh is its rich cultural heritage. We have a diverse population comprising various ethnic groups, religions, and languages, which contribute to our vibrant tapestry of traditions and customs.\nThe natural beauty of Bangladesh is truly breathtaking. We are blessed with lush green landscapes, picturesque rivers, and the world's largest river delta, the Sundarbans, home to the majestic Royal Bengal Tiger. Our cuisine is also something to behold, with mouthwatering dishes like biryani, hilsa fish curry, and pitha (traditional sweets) tantalizing taste buds across the nation.\nHowever, like any country, Bangladesh faces its share of challenges. We grapple with issues such as poverty, overpopulation, and environmental degradation. Yet, amidst these challenges, the resilience and spirit of the Bangladeshi people shine through.\nI would love to hear more about life in the U.K. and your experiences living there. Please feel free to ask me anything else you'd like to know about Bangladesh; I'm always eager to share more about my homeland.\nLooking forward to your next letter!\nWarm regards,\nAlif/Adrita"

      "uddipok": "Write a summary of the following text.\nOnce upon a time, there was a strange man who was highly bothered to see others' happiness. In fact, he hated the courteous and polite people around him and thus he hated a few expressions like please, thank you, don't mention it etc. It troubled him a lot when people around were smiling to use these expressions.\nThe man considered all these expressions extravagant. So, he took a mission to invent a device that would steal these polite words. He calculated two benefits from his efforts. One, people won't use these words and thus he would be relieved of his apathy to people's polite behavior and the second one was earning money by selling the words stolen by the machine to somebody else. After a few months' hard work, he succeeded in inventing the machine he desired for a long long time. The machine started working and it gave the man complete satisfaction. People from their long practice would try to say thank you, so kind of you, my pleasure, don't mention it etc. as to appreciate others or express gratitude. But their tongue could not produce these words. The machine caught them. It resulted in a huge change in people's behaviour and attitudes. Gradually people became rough and tough, they lost their mental cool, they were blaming each other or fighting with each other. They became so selfish that they started refusing\nto help others without having a return for their service.\nThe man was terribly happy with his success, but he didn't count on two little girls of special needs. They had speech difficulty and so they used to communicate using sign language. Since the machine couldn't steal gestures, these girls continued their previous practices, of being kind and polite. Soon they realised the difference between them and other people, which led them to investigate the reason. After much toil, they could discover the wicked man, who was in a hide out on the top of a hill next to the sea with his enormous machine busy in capturing people's polite words and separating them into letters. The girls found the man taking a nap when they crept up to the machine and rewind it so that people could get back to their normal behaviour.\nAs a result, the machine exploded, scattering all the letters it had gathered into the sky. After some moments, the letters started coming down, like rain, and ended up in the sea. After that, everyone became polite and respectful to each other again. The anger and the arguments stopped, proving that good manners are very useful for keeping people together in a spirit of happiness.",

He was selfish and hated polite people and polite expressions. So, he secretly invented a device to steal these extravagant words and sell them. As a result, people could not use polite words. This changed people's behavior and attitudes greatly. People became ill-mannered and selfish. The wicked man became very happy. However, two little girls of special needs who used sign languages to communicate were still polite and kind, because the machine could not steal gestures. Noticing the difference with others, they investigated it. They discovered the machine, which was capturing polite words and separating them into letters. Seeing the man sleeping, the girls rewound the machine."

(No. 1 has been done for you.)\nThe history of Bengal is the history of a people who have repeatedly made their highways red with their blood. We shed blood in 1952; even though we were the victors in the elections of 1954, we could not form a government then. In 1958, Ayub Khan declared Martial Law to enslave us for the next ten years. In 1966 when we launched the Six Point movement our boys were shot dead on 7 June. When after the movement of 1969 Ayub Khan fell from power and Yahya Khan assumed the reins of the government he declared that he would give us a constitution and restore democracy; we listened to him then. A lot has happened since and elections have taken place.\nI've met President Yahya Khan. I've made a request to him not only on behalf of Bengal but also as the leader of the party which has the majority in Pakistan; I said to him: \"You must hold the session of the National Assembly on 15 February.\" But he did not listen to me. He listened to Mr. Bhutto instead. At first, he said that the meeting would take place in the first week of March. We said, \"Fine, we will be taking our seats in the Assembly then.\" I said we would carry out our discussions in the Assembly.\n1.Bloodshed in 1952→\n2.→\n3.→\n4.→\n5.→\n6.",
