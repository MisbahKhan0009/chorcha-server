      "uddipok": "Write a Summary of the following text:\nKuakata, locally known as Sagar Kannya (Daughter of the Sea) is a rare scenic spot located on the southernmost tip of Bangladesh. Kuakata in Latachapli union under Kalapara Police Station of Patuakhali district is about 30 km in length and 6 km in breadth. It is 70 km from Patuakhali district headquarters and 320 km from Dhaka. An excellent combination of the picturesque natural beauty, sandy beaches, blue sky and the shimmering expanse of water of the Bay of Bengal and the evergreen forest makes Kuakata a much sought after tourist destination. The name Kuakata takes its origin from the story of a 'Kua'-or well -dug on the sea shore by the early Rakhaine settlers for collecting drinking water. The Rakhaines had landed on Kuakata coast after being expelled from Arakan by the Mughals. Following the first well, it became a tradition to dig wells in the neighborhood of Rakhaine homesteads for fresh water supply.\nKuakata is one of the unique spots which allow a visitor to watch both the sunrise and the sunset from the beach. That perhaps makes Kuakata one of the world's most attractive beaches. The long and wide beach at Kuakata has a typical natural setting. This sandy beach slopes gently into the Bay and bathing there is as pleasant as is swimming or diving",

          "explanation": "\n(a)\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines adolescence as the period of life between 10 and 19 years of age. This stage marks the transition from childhood to adulthood, characterized by significant physical, emotional, and social development. Adolescents experience rapid growth and undergo various changes that influence their health, behavior, and interactions with society.\n(b)\nAccording to the 2022 Bangladesh Census, the population of adolescents aged 10–14 is approximately 16.6 million, with 8.5 million boys and 7.8 million girls. For the 15–19 age group, there are about 16.5 million adolescents, comprising 8.1 million boys and 8.5 million girls. In total, adolescents make up about 28.8% of Bangladesh's population, with a near-equal distribution between boys and girls.\n(c)\nAdolescent girls in Bangladesh face several challenges\nChild Marriage : Approximately 51% of girls in Bangladesh are married before the age of 18, making it one of the highest rates globally.\nEducation : While enrollment rates for girls have improved, many still face barriers to completing secondary education, especially in rural areas.\nHealth Risks : Early pregnancies pose significant health risks, with many adolescent girls becoming mothers before reaching adulthood.\nViolence and Abuse : A significant number of adolescent girls experience physical or sexual violence, often within intimate relationships.\nThese issues hinder their development and access to opportunities, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.\n(d)\nIn Bangladesh, the legal age for marriage is 18 for girls and 21 for boys, as stipulated by the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 2017. However, the law includes provisions that allow for exceptions under certain circumstances, such as parental consent and court approval, which have been criticized for potentially undermining efforts to prevent child marriage.\n(e)\nWhile the legal age for marriage is 21 for boys in Bangladesh, readiness for marriage is influenced by various factors beyond age, including emotional maturity, financial stability, and societal expectations. Cultural norms often dictate that men should be established in their careers and capable of supporting a family before marriage. However, these expectations can vary widely across different communities and regions within the country."

      "uddipok": "Adolescents constitute a nation's core resource for national renewal and growth. Adolescence is a period in life when transition from childhood to adulthood takes place and behaviours and lifestyles are shaped. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), adolescence is the period which shapes the future of girls' and boys' lives. There are 28 million adolescents in Bangladesh; 13.7 million of them are girls and 14.3 million boys.\nThe situation of adolescent girls in Bangladesh is characterized by inequality and subordination within the family and society. This inequality leads to a widespread practice of child marriage, marginalization or exclusion from health, education and economic opportunities, and a vulnerability to violence and sexual abuse. In Bangladesh, the legal age of marriage is 18 for girls and 21 for boys. However, 33 percent of adolescent girls are married before the age of 15 and 60 percent. become mothers by the age of 19. Research finds that adolescents with higher level of education and from more 'affluent families tend to marry at a later age. Boys, however, become ready for marriage only after several years of adolescence and young adulthood.\nRead the above passage again and then write the antonyms or synonyms of the words as directed below:\n(a) core (synonym) (b) style (synonym) (c) violence (synonym) (d) inequality (antonym) (e) constitute (synonym) (f) abuse (antonym) (g) legal (synonym) (h) affluent (antonym) (i) wide spread (synonym) (j) growth (antonym).",

          "explanation": "Title: \"The Price of Greed\"\nOnce a farmer had a goose. It used to lay a golden egg every day. The farmer used to sell them in the market and within a short time, he became quite solvent. But his wife was very greedy. She was not satisfied with one golden egg a day. She often grumbled, “If this goose lays one golden egg daily, there must be a heap of gold inside it!”\nBlinded by her greed, she convinced the farmer to kill the goose and collect all the gold at once. Though hesitant, the farmer finally gave in. They slaughtered the goose with great hope and tore it open—only to find nothing inside.\nThere was no heap of gold, not even a single extra egg. The magic was gone. The goose was dead, and with it, their daily fortune vanished.\nMoral: Greed destroys the source of good fortune.\n"

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following text.\nAs a child you must have been told to greet your elders and visitors to your home according to your culture and tradition. You must also have been taught to be polite in company and keep quiet while others, especially your elders, spoke. Possibly, you at times grudged such schooling. Possibly, at times you even protested such disciplining. Now, certainly you know that you can't always behave the way you want specially in the presence of others. There are rules of behavior you have to follow in a company. We are social beings and have to consider the effect of our behavior on others, even if we are at home and dealing with our family members.\nWe have two terms to describe our social behavior- 'etiquette' and 'manners'. 'Etiquette' is a French word and it means the rules of correct behavior in society. The word 'manners' means the behavior that is considered to be polite in a particular society or culture.\nManners can be good or bad. For example, it is a bad manner to speak with food in one's mouth. No one likes a bad mannered person. Remember that etiquette and manners vary from culture to culture and from society to society.",

          "explanation": "Summary:\nYou must have been taught as a young child to greet your elders and house guests in accordance with your culture and custom. Additionally, you must have been taught to be polite in public and to be silent when others, particularly your elders, spoke. Maybe you sometimes regretted your education. Maybe you even resisted such discipline at times. You are aware that you cannot always act in the way you like, especially when other people are present.\nEtiquette and manners are two words we use to describe how we behave in social situations. You can have good or awful manners. Speaking while chewing food, for instance, is impolite. A rude individual is not popular. Keep in mind that manners and etiquette differ from culture to culture and from society to society.\nEtiquette and manners are lessons we pick up from our parents, families, and other institutions like schools, colleges, or professional organisations."
