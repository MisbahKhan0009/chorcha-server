      "uddipok": "Summarize the following text:\nBeauty is easy to appreciate but difficult to define. As we look around, we discover beauty in pleasurable objects and sights – in nature, in the laughter of children, in the kindness of strangers. But asked to define, we run into difficulties. Does beauty have an independent objective identity? Is it universal, or is it dependent on our sense perceptions? Does it lie in the eye of the beholder? We ask ourselves. A further difficulty arises when beauty manifests itself not only by its presence, but by its absence as well, as when we are repulsed by ugliness and desire beauty. But then ugliness has as much a place in our lives as beauty, or may be more ————- as when there is widespread hunger and injustice in a society. Philosophers have told us that beauty is an important part of life, but isn't ugliness a part of life too? And if art has beauty as an important ingredient, can it confine itself only to a projection of beauty? Can art ignore what is not beautiful?",

          "explanation": "Beauty is something appreciable but quite indefinable. In our surroundings, beauty can be seen in various enjoyable forms. But defining it on one's part is very difficult. Various types of questions about its existence, form and shape move around our mind. We are moved not only by its presence but also by its absence. So, ugliness occupies as much a place in our life as beauty. Though beauty is an important part of art, art cannot ignore ugliness."

(No. 1 has been done for you.)\nA peace movement is a social movement that seeks to achieve ideals such as the ending of a particular war (or all wars), minimize inter-human violence in a particular place or type of situation, including ban of guns, and is often linked to the goal of achieving world peace. Means to achieve these ends include advocacy of pacifism, non-violent resistance, diplomacy, boycotts, demonstrations, peace camps; supporting anti-war political candidates and banning guns, creating open government, direct democracy; supporting people who expose war-crimes or conspiracies to create wars, and making laws. Different organizations involved in peace movements may have some diverse goals, but one common goal is sustainability of peace.\nEnding of war →\n2→\n3→\n4→\n5→\n6",

It has numerous rivers, canals, beels, lakes, and vast areas of floodplains. Hakaluki haor is one of the major wetlands of Bangladesh. With a land area of 18,386 hectares, it supports a rich biodiversity and provides direct and indirect livelihood benefits to nearly 1,90,000 people. This haor was declared an Ecologically Critical Area in April 1999 by the government of Bangladesh. Hakaluki is a complex ecosystem, containing more than 238 interconnecting beels and jalmahals. The haor falls under two administrative districts, Maulvibazar and Sylhet. Some 1,90,000 people live in the area surrounding the haor.\nHakaluki haor is an important source of fisheries resources for Bangladesh. Kalibaus, Boal, Rui, Ghagot, Pabda, and Chapila are the main fish species found here. From the Kushiara, there are frequent upstream movements of fish towards the beels and tributaries of Hakaluki. The beels in Hakaluki haor provide winter shelter for the mother fisheries. In early monsoon, these mother fisheries produce millions of fries for the entire downstream fishing communities. Floodplains are also an important source of fisheries resources within the area. However, many of the beels have lost their capacity to provide shelter for mother fisheries because of sand deposits from upstream rivers and canals, use of complete dewatering technique for fishing and lack of aquatic plants to provide feed and shelter for parents fish.",

          "explanation": "The Historic Speech of 7 th 7^{\\text {th }} 7 th March\nThe historic 7 th 7^{\\text {th }} 7 th March Speech of Bangabandhu is a speech delivered by the founding father of Bangladesh- Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, at the then Ramna Racecourse ground (now Suhrawardy Udyan) in Dhaka to a gathering of over twenty thousand people on 7 March 1971. It was the core inspiration of our liberation war During the speech, Bangabandhu declared in a thunderous voice that \"The struggle, this time, is for our freedom; the fight, this time, is for our independence.\" It was delivered during a period of escalating tensions between East (now Bangladesh) and West Pakistan. Pakistani military rulers refused to transfer the power to Bangabandhu, whose party Awami League gained the majority by winning 167 of the 169 seats allotted to East Pakistan and a majority of the 313 seats in the National Assembly in the general election of 1970. The Bangalees were already in destitute due to the economic favoritism practiced by the West Pakistani rulers for 23 years. The speech inspired them to prepare for a war of independence amid widespread reports of armed mobilisation by West Pakistan. The Bangladesh Liberation War began 18 days later, when the Pakistan Army launched Operation Searchlight against Bengali civilians, intellectuals, students and politicians. On 30 October 2017, UNESCO has recognized the speech as a part of world's documentary heritage."

          "explanation": "The Honesty of a Student\nOne day, a boy named Shafi of class twelve was going to college. Suddenly, he saw a money purse dropped by someone on the road. He was quite at a loss to see the purse and decided to pick it up. He was not at all greedy and so was not in the least interested in grabbing the contents in the purse. He intended to open the purse to see if there was any visiting card. Fortunately, he found some visiting cards and ID card of the owner. Then the boy became somewhat pacified thinking that he might eventually return the purse to its real owner. However, the boy carried the bag to his parents. His parents were very pious and honest who were bringing up their son with proper moral and religious education. His father Mr. Sumon found the owner's address and mobile number on the visiting card. He called the number. The man who received phone sounded very anxious. Mr. Sumon asked him about his identity. Mr. Sumon noticed that the identity of the man corresponded with the visiting card and ID card. And the man's name was Mr. Rashid. Mr. Sumon asked Mr. Rashid if he had lost anything. Mr. Rashid anxiously replied that he had lost a purse containing a great amount of money and some documentary papers. Mr. Rashid's information completely corresponded (সংগতিপূর্ণ হওয়া) with the contents of the purse. M r \\mathrm{Mr} Mr . Sumon was certain that he (Mr. Rashid) was the real owner of the purse. He (Mr. Sumon) told him (Mr. Rashid) not to worry about the purse, adding that he (Mr. Rashid) would get back everything. Then Mr. Sumon told him to come to his (Mr. Sumon) address to receive his purse. Mr. Rashid and his wife at once started for Mr. Sumon's house. Mr. Sumon handed over the purse to Mr. Rashid. Mr. Rashid was overwhelmed with gratefulness and hugged Mr. Sumon. Mr. Rashid appreciated the boy for his honesty. Since then the two families developed a great friendly relationship between themselves."

          "explanation": "Subject: Exploring the Enchanting Landscapes of Bangladesh\nHey [Friend's Name],\nI hope this email finds you in good spirits! I've been meaning to share some of the incredible experiences I've had recently, particularly exploring the breathtaking beauty of Bangladesh. Trust me, it's been nothing short of mesmerizing!\nLet me paint you a picture of the landscapes that have left me in awe. Picture lush green fields stretching as far as the eye can see, with vibrant hues of paddy swaying gently in the breeze. The countryside here is like something out of a postcard, with quaint villages nestled amidst rolling hills and meandering rivers.\nSpeaking of rivers, you wouldn't believe the majesty of the mighty Padma, Meghna, and Jamuna rivers that crisscross the land. These waterways are not just lifelines for transportation and trade but also sources of timeless beauty. At sunset, the skies are set ablaze with hues of orange and pink, casting a magical glow over the tranquil waters below.\nBut it's not just the rural landscapes that steal the show; Bangladesh's coastal regions are a sight to behold as well. Miles of pristine sandy beaches stretch along the coastline, fringed by swaying palms and dotted with colorful fishing boats. And let me tell you about the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest. Navigating through its intricate network of waterways, surrounded by dense foliage and exotic wildlife, feels like stepping into a world untouched by time.\nOf course, no discussion of Bangladesh's beauty would be complete without mentioning its vibrant cities. Dhaka, the bustling capital, is a whirlwind of sights and sounds, where ancient mosques and modern skyscrapers coexist harmoniously. The streets are alive with the hustle and bustle of daily life, and the air is infused with the aroma of delicious street food.\nI could go on and on about the wonders of Bangladesh, but I'll leave it at that for now. Suffice it to say, this country has stolen a piece of my heart with its unparalleled beauty and warm hospitality. I can't wait for you to experience it for yourself someday.\nUntil then, take care, and keep dreaming of distant shores!\nWarm regards,\nRafa\n[Stamped with a picturesque image of Bangladesh's landscapes]"

In the year 1995, only 38.1 percent peóple of Bangladesh were literate. The rate took a good leap to 56 percent, in 2000. Unfortunately, in 2001 the number of literacy rate decreased to 47.9 percent. The trend of decrease continued for the next two years and it went down to 43.1 percent in 2003. A dramatical increase in the literacy rate was noticed for the next seven years. In 2010 , it reached to 56.8 percent. So, it can be said that within the period of 15 years, there was a great achievement in education sector. In that period of time, the literacy rate increased from 38.1 percent to 56.8 percent."
