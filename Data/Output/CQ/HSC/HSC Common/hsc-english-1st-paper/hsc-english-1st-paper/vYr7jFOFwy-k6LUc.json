Marrying off daughters at an early age is a standard practice for many families living in Rural Bangladesh. After her wedding Shilpi joined a local empowerment group that provide adolescent girls with the tools needed to gradually change cultural practices, particularly those pertaining to early marriage and pregnancy. The groups activities include discussions on how to most effectively change behaviour related to reproductive health as well as one-on-one counseling. It also offers peer-to-peer support and life skills training that helps adolescents say no to early marriage. The empowerment group is one of more than 10,000 groups supported by some local Non Government Organizations (NGOs) working all over Bangladesh. These NGOs work through Canada's adolescent reproductive health project which also aims to increase access to quality health services for adolescents. During one of the group sessions, Shilpi came to understand the potentially harmful effects of early marriage and pregnancy.\n\n1. Got married at 15 →2. → 3.. →4. . → 5. →6.",

Will you please sing a song for me?”\nThe crow felt proud and happy to hear the fox’s praise. Forgetting that the meat was in its beak, it opened its mouth to sing, and the piece of meat fell to the ground. The clever fox quickly picked it up and ran away, laughing.\nThe crow realized it had been fooled by false praise and felt ashamed. From that day on, the crow learned not to be proud and never to trust flatterers."
