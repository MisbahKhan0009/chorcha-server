          "explanation": "The pie chart displays the various sources of air pollution in a city, highlighting five key contributors. Vehicles are by far the most significant source, accounting for 60% of total air pollution. This indicates a heavy reliance on private and commercial transportation, possibly due to limited public transport infrastructure. Industry is the second-largest contributor at 18% , reflecting emissions from factories and manufacturing units. Power plants contribute 13% , suggesting that electricity generation—likely from fossil fuels—is another major pollutant. Waste disposal activities are responsible for 3% , while heating or using gas contributes nothing ( 0% ), showing negligible or highly controlled emissions in that category.\nThe disparity is stark: vehicles alone contribute more than all other sources combined, underscoring the urgent need for cleaner transport alternatives and stricter vehicular emission controls. In contrast, waste disposal and gas usage have a minimal impact, suggesting these are not major areas of concern. Targeted interventions in transport and industry could significantly improve air quality."

We were in a hilarious mood as we were talking about our plan to go on a picnic. Suddenly, we noticed an old woman who was begging money for his ailing son. It was hard for us to turn a blind eye. Her torn clothes and sad face brought tears to our eyes and we decided to help her. When we asked her about her son, she replied that her son was a garments worker and had been crippled due to an accident in the factory. The owner did not provide any compensation, and since then, she had to beg for buying foods and medicine for her son. All of us felt sorrow for the unfortunate woman and gave her the money we saved for the picnic. Then, we again started for the college while thanking the Almighty about our privileged lives.\nWe have our health, a roof over our head, foods on table and a million other blessings to count. It is the duty of the wealthy and the privileged section of the society to come forward to aid these unfortunate people."

          "explanation": "Subject: Importance of Responsible Social Media Sharing\nDear [Younger Brother/Sister's Name],\nI hope this letter finds you well. As your older sibling, I feel it's important to share some advice regarding your social media activities, particularly concerning the sharing of news articles and information.\nIn today's digital age, social media has become a powerful tool for communication and information sharing. While it offers numerous benefits, it also comes with certain responsibilities. One of these responsibilities is ensuring that the information we share is accurate, reliable, and credible.\nI've noticed that lately, you've been sharing a lot of news articles and stories on your social media accounts without verifying their authenticity. While I understand the urge to stay informed and share interesting content with your friends and followers, it's crucial to remember that not everything you come across on the internet is true.\nSharing fake or baseless news can have serious consequences. Not only does it contribute to the spread of misinformation, but it can also harm the reputations of individuals and organizations unfairly targeted by false claims. Moreover, it can fuel unnecessary panic and confusion among people who may believe the misinformation to be true.\nBefore sharing any news article or story on your social media accounts, I urge you to take a moment to verify its credibility. Look for reliable sources, cross-check the information with other reputable news outlets, and consider the context in which the story is presented. If you're unsure about the accuracy of a particular piece of news, it's better to refrain from sharing it altogether.\nRemember that as a member of the online community, you have the power to influence others with the content you share. By being mindful of the information you share and prioritizing accuracy and credibility, you can contribute to a more informed and responsible digital environment.\nIf you ever come across news or information that you're unsure about, don't hesitate to reach out to me or other trusted sources for guidance. Together, we can work towards promoting responsible social media behavior and combating the spread of misinformation.\nThank you for taking the time to read this letter, and please know that I'm always here to offer support and guidance whenever you need it.\nTake care, and I look forward to seeing you soon.\nWarm regards,\n[Your Name]"

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following passage.\nWe spend money for different reasons. We buy foods, clothes or everyday essentials, pay for different services, entertain people, travel to places, help others in need or invest in business and thus spend money every day. In fact, spending is a part of our life.\nSpending may make us happy or unhappy depending on how and why we spend. When we spend money on things that we need and within our limit, it is good. When it becomes a compulsive behaviour, it makes life stressful. Unnecessary spending or spending beyond one's means has some bad effects. For one thing, it may lead to financial ruin or debt, and for another,. it may create unhappiness within families. People who overspend are never satisfied with what they have. They always rush for brands, fashion items, designer clothes, etc. Over a period of time, it becomes an addiction which may eventually create psychological problems.\nNowadays, consumer items are displayed in stores or in advertisements in ways that they create a feeling of immediate need for them. We are constantly tempted to buy, use or consume things even when we do not have a genuine need. We all need to be careful here. Salespersons often encourage customers to buy things by flattering them. 'This is a perfect match for you,' they would say. or 'You look so stunning in that dress.' Never forget, they say the same thing to most of their customers. It is better not to be persuaded by such words. They use these words to please the customers as the more a customer buys, the higher the profit is. Overspending is not only related to shopping, it applies to other activities as well such as eating out. Many people buy too many items to eat in a restaurant. They can eat only some of them and the rest are wasted: It's not a responsible attitude. We cannot simply waste food because we have money to buy it.\nYoung people in a shopping mall often look at an item on display afd think 'Oh I must buy this. I really need this.' They may not have the money needed. In their wallet. So, they use credit cards but using them is like taking a loan. If they are not careful, the loans increase which might lead them to a debt-trap.\nSometimes children insist on buying things that their parents cannot pay without stretching their budget. This may happen because the children's friends also have them. It's not fair as it becomes a burden for the parents.\nFinally, don't get trapped by the glossy advertisements on television or the Internet. You should rather ask yourself: \"Do I need this?\" The best way to control the habit of spending is not to think 'What I need', but 'Can I do without it?'",

          "explanation": "Money is spent every day for various reasons. Necessary expenses within our limit may make us happy. But unnecessary expenditure or spending money beyond our ability creates some problems and may lead to psychological problems. At present, consumer items are exhibited and advertised so attractively that we want to buy them immediately even without having a genuine need. Salespersons often flatter the customers to encourage them to buy more things. Buying more foods than requirements and their wastage means wastage of money. Children also make their parents fall in economic crisis by pressurizing them to buy unnecessary things. We should restrain this habit of overspending by asking ourselves if we can do without the thing we feel tempted to buy."

(One has been done for you):\nThe Island of St. Martin is the only coral island in Bangladesh located in the north-eastern part of Bay of Bengal. The roughly flat island is only above 3.6 metre above the sea level. The entire island can be walked about in 3 hours. The island is known for its unique natural beauty with white sandy beaches fringed with coconut palms and a diverse marine life. Due to the expansion of unregulated tourism, the island is facing increasing erosion, contamination of surface and ground water, wildlife displacement, and loss of biodiversity. Other threats include cutting of sand dune vegetation for fuel-wood and hotel establishment; degradation of sand dune habitat; the harvesting of turtle eggs; indiscriminate exploitation of coral resources etc. To address this, the Government has declared some areas of the island as Ecologically Critical Area (ECA), prohibiting unauthorized constructions there.\nOnly coral island in Bangladesh → 2. → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6",

But all his joys fade away as he has to go to school where he spends weary hours. He considers himself a bird that should not be caged, and a joy that should not be dismayed. So, he pleads his parents to rescue him from the drudgery of school lessons. In schools are often boring and lifeless which deprives the boy from getting joy and pleasure in nature."
