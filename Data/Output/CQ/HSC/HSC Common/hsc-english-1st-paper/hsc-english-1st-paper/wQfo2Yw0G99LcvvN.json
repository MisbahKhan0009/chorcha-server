          "explanation": "Subject: Importance of Responsible Social Media Sharing\nDear [Younger Brother/Sister's Name],\nI hope this letter finds you well. As your older sibling, I feel it's important to share some advice regarding your social media activities, particularly concerning the sharing of news articles and information.\nIn today's digital age, social media has become a powerful tool for communication and information sharing. While it offers numerous benefits, it also comes with certain responsibilities. One of these responsibilities is ensuring that the information we share is accurate, reliable, and credible.\nI've noticed that lately, you've been sharing a lot of news articles and stories on your social media accounts without verifying their authenticity. While I understand the urge to stay informed and share interesting content with your friends and followers, it's crucial to remember that not everything you come across on the internet is true.\nSharing fake or baseless news can have serious consequences. Not only does it contribute to the spread of misinformation, but it can also harm the reputations of individuals and organizations unfairly targeted by false claims. Moreover, it can fuel unnecessary panic and confusion among people who may believe the misinformation to be true.\nBefore sharing any news article or story on your social media accounts, I urge you to take a moment to verify its credibility. Look for reliable sources, cross-check the information with other reputable news outlets, and consider the context in which the story is presented. If you're unsure about the accuracy of a particular piece of news, it's better to refrain from sharing it altogether.\nRemember that as a member of the online community, you have the power to influence others with the content you share. By being mindful of the information you share and prioritizing accuracy and credibility, you can contribute to a more informed and responsible digital environment.\nIf you ever come across news or information that you're unsure about, don't hesitate to reach out to me or other trusted sources for guidance. Together, we can work towards promoting responsible social media behavior and combating the spread of misinformation.\nThank you for taking the time to read this letter, and please know that I'm always here to offer support and guidance whenever you need it.\nTake care, and I look forward to seeing you soon.\nWarm regards,\n[Your Name]"

      "uddipok": "Write a summary of the following passage.\nEducation aims to bring about positive changes in our behavior. It helps us try to change our lives as well as the society we live in. Education that does not illuminate our minds or does not inspire us to work for the community is not complete at all. Education is not all about getting grades or receiving certificates- we use education to make life better. We are expected to apply the knowledge, skills and values that we learn in a classroom in our engagement with the world that lies outside. And we can do so in many different ways. Let's have a look at how education works. Learners' civic engagement is highly appreciated all over the world. Civic engagement means working to make a difference in the civic life (the public life of the citizens as constructed with private or personal life) of the community using knowledge, skills, values and motivation. Civic engagement promotes the quality of life in a community by contributing to the improvement of health and wellbeing of the people.\nCivically engaged individuals recognize themselves as members of a larger social community and are concerned about civic issues. They consider themselves responsible citizens who take action or raise their voices against injustice, discrimination and other forms of social ills.\nIn civic engagement, issues of public concern are crucial. Civic engagement includes individual or group activities to protect public interests and change the way the community values itself. For example, If you are protesting against any unjust decision of the local municipality such as raising taxes or an act that might work against people's interests, you are civically engaged and your action is considered a civic engagement. This protest can be done in different ways such as organizing rallies, collecting signatures, making human chains, writing petitions, etc. You can also help control traffic in front of a school, help children to cross the roads, work in a team to clean a park or a sea beach. You can also give some services to elderly people. These are all examples of civic engagement as what you do directly affects the community.\nWhen civic engagement is a part of an academic program, and the learners' engagement is assessed following a scale, then it is called service learning. It involves the application of knowledge and skills learned in the classroom and then making a complete plan of action 1.e. preparing a budget, starting the process of implementation, involving people and activating operational strategies.",

          "question": "",
          "explanation": "\n(a)\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines adolescence as the period of life between 10 and 19 years of age. This stage marks the transition from childhood to adulthood, characterized by significant physical, emotional, and social development. Adolescents experience rapid growth and undergo various changes that influence their health, behavior, and interactions with society.\n(b)\nAccording to the 2022 Bangladesh Census, the population of adolescents aged 10–14 is approximately 16.6 million, with 8.5 million boys and 7.8 million girls. For the 15–19 age group, there are about 16.5 million adolescents, comprising 8.1 million boys and 8.5 million girls. In total, adolescents make up about 28.8% of Bangladesh's population, with a near-equal distribution between boys and girls.\n(c)\nAdolescent girls in Bangladesh face several challenges\nChild Marriage : Approximately 51% of girls in Bangladesh are married before the age of 18, making it one of the highest rates globally.\nEducation : While enrollment rates for girls have improved, many still face barriers to completing secondary education, especially in rural areas.\nHealth Risks : Early pregnancies pose significant health risks, with many adolescent girls becoming mothers before reaching adulthood.\nViolence and Abuse : A significant number of adolescent girls experience physical or sexual violence, often within intimate relationships.\nThese issues hinder their development and access to opportunities, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.\n(d)\nIn Bangladesh, the legal age for marriage is 18 for girls and 21 for boys, as stipulated by the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 2017. However, the law includes provisions that allow for exceptions under certain circumstances, such as parental consent and court approval, which have been criticized for potentially undermining efforts to prevent child marriage.\n(e)\nWhile the legal age for marriage is 21 for boys in Bangladesh, readiness for marriage is influenced by various factors beyond age, including emotional maturity, financial stability, and societal expectations. Cultural norms often dictate that men should be established in their careers and capable of supporting a family before marriage. However, these expectations can vary widely across different communities and regions within the country."

      "uddipok": "Write a summary of the following text.\nThe famous Greek philosopher Aristotle said, \"Man is by nature a social animal.\" What he meant was that man, by instinct, seeks company of others and establishes relationships, much like most animals of the wild, for companionship and for physical and emotional support. Unlike the animals however, man's relationships give meaning to his existence and inspires him to do well in education, in workplace or in a profession that he pursues.\nRelationships are of different kinds. Some are familial and intimate, formed by blood and by marriage; some are social like the ones we have with friends and some are made in school where we, form close bonds with classmates and teachers. Relationships can also be fostered in workplace, which may quickly change from professional to social. There are relationships also between human beings and animals, between children and their toys that they cannot part with.\nAll these relationships keep us close to each other and provide us all kinds of support, love and affection. A person who has no family feels the pain of loneliness and isolation. There is no one to laugh or cry with him/her. When we share our joy with someone, it simply redoubles, and when we suffer a loss and someone shares our sorrow, it lessens. Relationships are thus needed for our emotional health.\nTo build relationships, we need to have trust and respect for each other, and love where this is needed. We cannot be selfish and possessive if we want to establish an effective relationship. But quite often we see people quarrelling and fighting with each other which only brings misery and loss to all.",

          "explanation": "The passage portrays the fact that human beings naturally develop different types of relationships through trust, respect and love. Relationships are formed by blood or marriage, in educational institutions or workplaces, etc. Relationships give meaning to our existence and inspire us to perform well in every stage. Moreover, relationships fill our life with love, support, and endearment. Lonely and isolated people cannot share their joy or sorrow. Through sharing, happiness increases, and sorrows decreases. Hence, relationships are essential for mental health. However, relationships with selfishness and possessiveness are detrimental to mental health and cause sufferings."
