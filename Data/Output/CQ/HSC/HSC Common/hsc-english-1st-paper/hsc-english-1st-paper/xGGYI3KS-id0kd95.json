          "question": "",
          "explanation": "\n(a)\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines adolescence as the period of life between 10 and 19 years of age. This stage marks the transition from childhood to adulthood, characterized by significant physical, emotional, and social development. Adolescents experience rapid growth and undergo various changes that influence their health, behavior, and interactions with society.\n(b)\nAccording to the 2022 Bangladesh Census, the population of adolescents aged 10–14 is approximately 16.6 million, with 8.5 million boys and 7.8 million girls. For the 15–19 age group, there are about 16.5 million adolescents, comprising 8.1 million boys and 8.5 million girls. In total, adolescents make up about 28.8% of Bangladesh's population, with a near-equal distribution between boys and girls.\n(c)\nAdolescent girls in Bangladesh face several challenges\nChild Marriage : Approximately 51% of girls in Bangladesh are married before the age of 18, making it one of the highest rates globally.\nEducation : While enrollment rates for girls have improved, many still face barriers to completing secondary education, especially in rural areas.\nHealth Risks : Early pregnancies pose significant health risks, with many adolescent girls becoming mothers before reaching adulthood.\nViolence and Abuse : A significant number of adolescent girls experience physical or sexual violence, often within intimate relationships.\nThese issues hinder their development and access to opportunities, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.\n(d)\nIn Bangladesh, the legal age for marriage is 18 for girls and 21 for boys, as stipulated by the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 2017. However, the law includes provisions that allow for exceptions under certain circumstances, such as parental consent and court approval, which have been criticized for potentially undermining efforts to prevent child marriage.\n(e)\nWhile the legal age for marriage is 21 for boys in Bangladesh, readiness for marriage is influenced by various factors beyond age, including emotional maturity, financial stability, and societal expectations. Cultural norms often dictate that men should be established in their careers and capable of supporting a family before marriage. However, these expectations can vary widely across different communities and regions within the country."

      "uddipok": "Write a summary of the following passage:\nMy name is Amerigo. I am 13 years old and I live on the street alone. My mother, who is separated from my father, doesn't want me. She told me to go away Now she is married to another man. My father lives very far away. I want to go to him, but he won't take me either. I begged him to send me some money so that I could buy a bus ticket. I am still waiting. He has not answered: The streets are now my home. Sometimes I find work. I used to collect trash and sell it to a vendor. I stopped doing that after I had a serious infection and a doctor told me to stay away from the trash dump. Once I worked for an ice-cream shop owner and sold ice-cream on the beach. But I got no money in return. The owner of the shop gave me something to eat, and let me sleep in his hut at night. The work was difficult and painful. The ice-cream box is quite heavy when it is full. I had to walk for hours, offering my ice-cream to whoever wanted to buy.. There were days when I could not even sell one ice-cream. In a way, I am lucky because I am alive. My friends who work sorting rubbish in dumps often suffer from serious diseases. One of them was recently killed after he fell into a hole that opened up in the pile of trash. Many of us work for 10 to 12 hours, and get so little in return that we can't even buy food.",

          "explanation": "The passage follows the story of Amerigo, a 13-year-old boy who lives alone on the streets after being rejected by both his mother and father. His mother sent him away, and his father, who lives far away, has not responded to his pleas for help. Amerigo survives by finding occasional work, such as collecting and selling trash, despite the health risks involved. He once worked for an ice-cream shop but received no money, only food and a place to sleep. Despite the hardships, Amerigo considers himself fortunate to be alive, unlike some of his friends who have suffered serious illnesses or even death from their work in trash dumps. Many like him work long hours for minimal pay, struggling to afford basic necessities like food."

      "uddipok": "Write a summary of the following text.\nThe famous Greek philosopher Aristotle said, \"Man is by nature a social animal.\" What he meant was that man, by instinct, seeks company of others and establishes relationships, much like most animals of the wild, for companionship and for physical and emotional support. Unlike the animals however, man's relationships give meaning to his existence and inspires him to do well in education, in workplace or in a profession that he pursues.\nRelationships are of different kinds. Some are familial and intimate, formed by blood and by marriage; some are social like the ones we have with friends and some are made in school where we, form close bonds with classmates and teachers. Relationships can also be fostered in workplace, which may quickly change from professional to social. There are relationships also between human beings and animals, between children and their toys that they cannot part with.\nAll these relationships keep us close to each other and provide us all kinds of support, love and affection. A person who has no family feels the pain of loneliness and isolation. There is no one to laugh or cry with him/her. When we share our joy with someone, it simply redoubles, and when we suffer a loss and someone shares our sorrow, it lessens. Relationships are thus needed for our emotional health.\nTo build relationships, we need to have trust and respect for each other, and love where this is needed. We cannot be selfish and possessive if we want to establish an effective relationship. But quite often we see people quarrelling and fighting with each other which only brings misery and loss to all.",

          "explanation": "The passage portrays the fact that human beings naturally develop different types of relationships through trust, respect and love. Relationships are formed by blood or marriage, in educational institutions or workplaces, etc. Relationships give meaning to our existence and inspire us to perform well in every stage. Moreover, relationships fill our life with love, support, and endearment. Lonely and isolated people cannot share their joy or sorrow. Through sharing, happiness increases, and sorrows decreases. Hence, relationships are essential for mental health. However, relationships with selfishness and possessiveness are detrimental to mental health and cause sufferings."

          "explanation": "The bar graph shows how the calorie consumption of people in seven countries (China, Afghanistan, Bhutan, Pakistan, India, Nepal, and Bangladesh) has changed from 1975 to 2023. Each country has two bars: one for 1975 and one for 2023. For example, in China, the average calorie intake was about 2000 calories in 1975, and it increased to around 3000 calories in 2023. In contrast, countries such as Afghanistan, Bhutan, Pakistan, and India shows a smaller consumption gap of 100 to 300 calories. For example, the intake in Afghanistan, Bhutan, Pakistan and India increased by only around 300, 200, 200 and 100 calories-respectively. On the other hand, the calorie intake in Bangladesh marks a significant rise. In 1975, the calorie consumption was 1400, which rose to around 2200 calories in 2023. Comparing to other countries, Nepal shows the lowest calorie consumption both in 1975 and in 2023.\nOverall, all the countries in the graph show higher calorie intakes in 2023 compared to 1975. China, Bangladesh and Nepal, in particular, experienced a significant increase."

          "explanation": "The Tale of the White Death\nSimo Häyhä, often referred to by his nickname The White Death, was a Finnish military sniper during World War II in the 1939-1940 Winter War between Finland and the Soviet Union. He used a Finnish-produced M/28-30 rifle and a Suomi KP/-31 submachine gun. Häyhä is believed to have killed over 500 enemy soldiers during the conflict, the highest number of sniper kills in any major war. Consequently, he is generally regarded as the deadliest sniper in history. During the war, the \"White Death\" was one of the leading themes of Finnish propaganda.\nAll of Häyhä's kills were accomplished in less than 100 days, an average of five per day at a time of year with very few daylight hours. His kill count as a sniper was based on his own reporting, with the confirmation of his comrades, and only those who were verified to be dead were counted. No count was taken when several snipers shot at the same target. Enemy soldiers who got killed with a submachine gun with Häyhä as a group leader were not counted.\nHäyhä estimated in his private war memoir that he shot around 500 Soviet soldiers. Written in 1940 (a few months after he was wounded), his Sotamuistoja ('War Memoirs') describes his experiences in the Winter War from 30 November 1939 to 13 March 1940. Hidden for decades, the memoir was discovered in 2017."

I wanted to talk to you about something important that recently came to my attention.\nI came to know that you’ve been sharing some news and information on your social media accounts without checking whether they are true or not. As your elder brother, I feel it’s my responsibility to guide you on this matter.\nSharing fake or unauthentic news, even unintentionally, can be very harmful. It can mislead people, create confusion, spread fear, and sometimes even damage someone’s reputation. In today’s digital world, information spreads very fast—once something false is shared, it’s almost impossible to take it back completely.\nMoreover, many people trust what they see online, especially when it comes from someone they know. That’s why it’s important to be extra careful before posting or forwarding anything. Always try to verify the facts from reliable sources. Think about how your post might affect others before you click \"share.\"\nI know you didn’t mean any harm, but being responsible online is just as important as being responsible in real life. I believe you will take this seriously and make sure not to share anything without checking it first.\nTake care of yourself and keep using social media wisely.\nWith love, Mr. Chan"
