          "explanation": "Banani, Dhaka 23rd November 2024\nDear Rafiq,\nI hope this letter finds you in good health and great spirits. I’m writing to tell you about an exciting event that took place at our college yesterday—our annual prize-giving ceremony. It was a grand occasion and one of the most memorable days of the year!\nThe program began in the morning, around 10 a.m., in our college auditorium, which was decorated with colorful flowers, banners, and fairy lights. The atmosphere was festive, and everyone seemed eager for the event to start. Our Chief Guest was a prominent scientist, whose inspiring presence added prestige to the occasion.\nThe event opened with a beautiful recitation from the Holy Quran, followed by a welcome speech by our principal. Then came the most awaited part: the prize distribution. Students were awarded for their achievements in academics, extracurricular activities, and sports. It was so inspiring to see their hard work being celebrated. I was thrilled to receive a prize for my essay writing competition, and the applause from the audience made it even more special!\nAfter the prizes were handed out, we enjoyed some cultural performances. A drama performed by our classmates had everyone in stitches, while a mesmerizing dance performance earned huge applause. The program ended with an inspiring speech from the Chief Guest, who encouraged us to dream big and work hard to achieve our goals.\nThe event concluded with refreshments, and we spent some time chatting and taking photos with friends and teachers. The day was filled with joy, laughter, and pride, and I’ll cherish these memories for a long time.\nI wish you had been there to enjoy it with me. How are things on your end? Write back soon—I’d love to hear from you.\nTake care!\nYour friend, Tahmid"

          "explanation": "Title: The Ant and the Dove\nAn ant lived on the bank of a river. The level of water in the river was increasing gradually. One day, a wave struck the shore. At that moment, the ant was walking. It slipped into the water and began to struggle desperately. The current was strong, and the poor ant was about to drown.\nJust then, a dove sitting on a nearby tree saw the ant in danger. Moved by compassion, the dove quickly plucked a leaf from the tree and dropped it into the river near the ant. The ant climbed onto the leaf and floated safely to the shore. It looked up at the dove with gratitude and silently promised to return the kindness someday.\nA few days later, a hunter came to the riverbank with a net. He aimed his weapon at the same dove resting peacefully on a branch. The ant noticed it and knew it had to act fast. It crawled to the hunter’s foot and bit him sharply. Startled, the hunter missed his aim, and the dove flew away to safety.\nThus, the ant repaid the dove’s kindness. Both went on with their lives, grateful for each other.\nMoral: A good deed is never forgotten."

We see that 35% of the total income of the family is spent on food while 5% on clothes. Educational expenses in the family consume 20% of the total income. 4% is spent on utility bills. Transport expenses consume 4% of the total income of the family. 31% is spent on house rents. 1% income of the family goes down to savings. Analysing the pie chart, we can say that the family spends the highest amount of money on food. Its second highest amount of total income is spent on house rent. The family also saves a little money."

(No. 1 has been done for you.)\nThe history of Bengal is the history of a people who have repeatedly made their highways red with their blood. We shed blood in 1952; even though we were the victors in the elections of 1954, we could not form a government then. In 1958, Ayub Khan declared Martial Law to enslave us for the next ten years. In 1966 when we launched the Six Point movement our boys were shot dead on 7 June. When after the movement of 1969 Ayub Khan fell from power and Yahya Khan assumed the reins of the government he declared that he would give us a constitution and restore democracy; we listened to him then. A lot has happened since and elections have taken place.\nI've met President Yahya Khan. I've made a request to him not only on behalf of Bengal but also as the leader of the party which has the majority in Pakistan; I said to him: \"You must hold the session of the National Assembly on 15 February.\" But he did not listen to me. He listened to Mr. Bhutto instead. At first, he said that the meeting would take place in the first week of March. We said, \"Fine, we will be taking our seats in the Assembly then.\" I said we would carry out our discussions in the Assembly.\n1.Bloodshed in 1952→\n2.→\n3.→\n4.→\n5.→\n6.",

      "uddipok": "Read the following text and make a flow chart showing the features of dream. (One is done for you.)\nDreams have fascinated philosophers for thousands of years, but only recently have dreams been subjected to empirical research and scientific study. Chances are that you've often found yourself puzzling over the content of a dream, or perhaps you've' wondered why you dream at all. First, let's start by answering a basic question: What is a dream? A dream can include any of the images, thoughts and emotions that are experienced during sleep. Dreams. can be extraordinarily vivid or very vague; filled with joyful emotions or frightening images, focused and understandable or unclear and confusing.\nWhy do we dream? What purpose do dreams serve? While many theories have been proposed no consensus has emerged. Considering the time. we spend in a dreaming state, the fact that researchers do not yet understand the purpose of dreams may seem baffling. However, it is important to consider that science is still unraveling the exact purpose and function of sleep itself: Some researchers suggest that dreams serve no real purpose, while others believe that dreaming is essential to mental, emotional and physical well-being.\nNext, let's learn more about some of the most prominent dream theories. Consistent with the psychoanalytic perspective, Sigmund Freud's theory of dreams suggests that dreams are a representation of subconscious desires, thoughts and motivations. According to Freud, people are driven by aggressive and sexual instincts that are repressed from conscious awareness. While these thoughts are not consciously expressed, they find their way into our awareness via dreams. In his famous book The Interpretation of Dreams (1899). Freud wrote that dreams are \"..... disguised fulfilments of repressed wishes.\"\nFull of thoughts, images and emotions→\n2.→\n3.→\n4.→\n5.→\n6.",
