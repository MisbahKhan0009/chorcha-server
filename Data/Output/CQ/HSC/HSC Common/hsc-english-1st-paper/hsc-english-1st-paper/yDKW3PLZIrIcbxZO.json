          "explanation": "The pie chart illustrates how a typical student divides their 24‑hour day among various activities. The largest portions are dedicated to sleep (30 %) and college hours (25 %), highlighting the fundamental commitments to rest and academics. The next significant segment is study , which occupies 20 % of the day, signaling an ongoing effort to reinforce learning outside class. Leisurely activities like recreation take up 12 %, offering balance and downtime, while play accounts for a smaller 5 %, portraying more spontaneous or fun engagement. Finally, a modest 8 % is categorized under other —likely including tasks such as meals, personal care, commuting, or light chores. Overall, this distribution reflects a well-rounded daily schedule where academic responsibilities and rest dominate, yet there remains space for recreation, play, and miscellaneous activities that contribute to a holistic routine."

          "explanation": "Persia produced one of the greatest poets in the world. He is commonly known as Sheikh Saadi. One day, he was traveling through a distant village. Tired and dusty, he stopped at the house of a rich man and asked for shelter for the night.\nThe rich man looked at his simple clothes and thought he was just a poor wanderer. He rudely refused and slammed the door. Sheikh Saadi quietly walked away and spent the night at a nearby mosque.\nThe next day, he returned to the village, this time dressed in fine clothes, as he had received new ones from a friend. When the same rich man saw him in elegant dress, he rushed out to greet him, offered food, and invited him inside with great respect.\nDuring dinner, Sheikh Saadi began putting the food into his pockets instead of eating it. The rich man was shocked and asked, “Sir, why are you doing that?”\nSheikh Saadi replied with a calm smile, “You didn’t offer this food to me yesterday when I came in simple clothes. Today, you are honoring my clothes, not my character. So let them enjoy the meal.”\nThe rich man realized his mistake and begged for forgiveness. This story reminds us that we should value people for who they are, not for what they wear or own.\n"

My joy knew no bounds to receive the sletter containing much good advice for me.\nIn your letter I have noticed a great worry about my study and my spending a lot of time on Facebook. But, father, you have nothing to be worried about. I am really very busy with my ensuing HSC Examination. In our college, a special coaching arrangement has been made and we have to participate (অংশগ্রহণ করা) in the scheduled coaching programmes dally. We solve our daily problems in the coaching classes. So, we need not have to bother (মাথা ঘামান) for our studies at our house. As for spending time on facebook, I spend maximum thirty minutes on Facebook daily. This is required in this age of technology. It does not hamper my studies at all, rather I learn many important things out of it. So, please don't worry in this respect. I am very conscious of my studies. We all are well here. Please take care of your health.\nYours affectionately,\nSamina"

I could picture him at four. with the same grave gray-blue eyes and the same independence? No, the word that comes to me is \"integrity\". ‥ It is bedded on courage, but it is more than brave. It is honest, but it is more than honesty. The ax handle broke one day. Jerry said the woodshop at the orphanage would repair it. I brought money to pay for the job and he refused it. \"I'll pay for it,\" he said. \"I broke it. I brought the ax down.careless.\" \"But no one hits accurately every time,\" I told him. \"The fault was in the wood of the handle. I'll see the man from whom I bought it.\" It was only then that he would take the money. He was standing back of his own carelessness.

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following text.\nValentina Tereshkova was born in a village, in Central Russia on 6 March 1937. Her father was a tractor driver and her mother worked in a textile plant. At the age of eight she began her schooling but did not enjoy it much. She left the school within a few years. Afterwards she completed her education through distance learning. She became interested in parachuting from a young age, and trained in skydiving at the local Aeroclub, making her first jump at age 22 on 21 May 1959. It was her expertise in skydiving that led to her selection as a cosmonaut.After the flight of Yuri Gagarin, the first human being to travel to outer space in April 1961, the Soviet Union decided to send a woman in space. On 16 February 1962, \"proletaria\" Valentina Tereshkova was selected for this project from among more than four hundred applicants. Tereshkova had to undergo a series of training that included weightless flights, isolation tests, centrifuge tests, rocket theory, spacecraft engineering, 120 parachute jumps and pilot training in MiG-15UTI jet fighters. Since the successful launch of the spacecraft Vostok-5 on 14 June 1963, Tereshkova began preparing for her own flight. On the morning of 16 June 1963, Tereshkova and her. back-up cosmonaut Solovyova were dressed in space-suits and taken to the space shuttle launch pad by a bus. After completing her communication and life support checks, she was sealed inside Vostok-6. Finishing a two-\nhour countdown, Vostok-6 launched faultlessly. Although Tereshkova experienced nausea and physical discomfort for much of the flight, she orbited the earth 48 times and spent almost three days in space. With a single flight, she logged more flight time than the combined times of all American astronauts who had flown before that date. Tereshkova also maintained a flight log and took photographs of the horizon, which were later used to identify aerosol layers within the atmosphere. Vostok-6 was the final Vostok flight and was launched two days after Vostok-5, which carried Valary Bykovsky into a similar orbit for five days, landing three hours after Tereshkova. The two vessels approached each other within 5 kilometers at one point, and from space Tereshkova communicated with Bykovsky and the Soviet leader Khrushchev by radio.",

Passionate about parachuting, she trained extensively and made her first jump at 22. Selected as a cosmonaut in 1962, she underwent rigorous training. On June 16, 1963, she boarded Vostok-6, becoming the first woman in space. Despite feeling discomfort, she orbited Earth 48 times in nearly three days, contributing valuable data. Her flight time surpassed combined American astronaut times. Tereshkova's achievements marked a significant milestone in space exploration."

          "question": "",
          "explanation": "\n(a)\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) defines adolescence as the period of life between 10 and 19 years of age. This stage marks the transition from childhood to adulthood, characterized by significant physical, emotional, and social development. Adolescents experience rapid growth and undergo various changes that influence their health, behavior, and interactions with society.\n(b)\nAccording to the 2022 Bangladesh Census, the population of adolescents aged 10–14 is approximately 16.6 million, with 8.5 million boys and 7.8 million girls. For the 15–19 age group, there are about 16.5 million adolescents, comprising 8.1 million boys and 8.5 million girls. In total, adolescents make up about 28.8% of Bangladesh's population, with a near-equal distribution between boys and girls.\n(c)\nAdolescent girls in Bangladesh face several challenges\nChild Marriage : Approximately 51% of girls in Bangladesh are married before the age of 18, making it one of the highest rates globally.\nEducation : While enrollment rates for girls have improved, many still face barriers to completing secondary education, especially in rural areas.\nHealth Risks : Early pregnancies pose significant health risks, with many adolescent girls becoming mothers before reaching adulthood.\nViolence and Abuse : A significant number of adolescent girls experience physical or sexual violence, often within intimate relationships.\nThese issues hinder their development and access to opportunities, perpetuating cycles of poverty and inequality.\n(d)\nIn Bangladesh, the legal age for marriage is 18 for girls and 21 for boys, as stipulated by the Child Marriage Restraint Act of 2017. However, the law includes provisions that allow for exceptions under certain circumstances, such as parental consent and court approval, which have been criticized for potentially undermining efforts to prevent child marriage.\n(e)\nWhile the legal age for marriage is 21 for boys in Bangladesh, readiness for marriage is influenced by various factors beyond age, including emotional maturity, financial stability, and societal expectations. Cultural norms often dictate that men should be established in their careers and capable of supporting a family before marriage. However, these expectations can vary widely across different communities and regions within the country."
