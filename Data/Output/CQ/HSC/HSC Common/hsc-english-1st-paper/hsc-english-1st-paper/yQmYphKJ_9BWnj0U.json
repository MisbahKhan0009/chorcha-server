He groomed himself up as a young man who earned success by dint of perseverance and commitment. When the Pakistan military began its genocide in Bangladesh, he joined the Liberation War and received military training at Camp Murtee located at the Himalayan foothills in India. The tall young man who carried himself with dignity and possessed remarkable traits of leadership became the ADC of General Ataul Goni, Osmani, the Commander in Chief of Bangladesh Armed Forces during the Liberation War. After Independence, Sheikh Kamal could, easily remain in Bangladesh Army and pass a secure life but he preferred to engage himself in country building and organizing the young forces to that end, Journalist Syed Ishtiaq Rezi in one of his columns 'Ekjon Sheikh Kamal' in Bangla Tribune rightly says that the unique qualities of Sheikh Kamal's character, especially his wholehearted involvement in sports and culture are never seen in any son or daughter of any President, Prime Minister or High Officials in Bangladesh.",

He joined the Liberation War during the Pakistan military's genocide in Bangladesh, receiving military training in India and serving as ADC to General Osmani. After independence, instead of pursuing a secure military career, he focused on nation-building and youth organization.

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following passage:\nA plate of hot French fries and a huge burger with hot cheese oozing out of it, with a carbonated drink: looks like a treat! This calorie-rich junk food does look mouthwatering but is known to be nutritionally poor. Junk food or fast food has become an increasingly popular food choice. Ideally, junk foods are defined as processed foods with negligible nutrient value and are often high in salt, sugar and fat. But we often confuse fast foods with junk foods. How are they different? Or what is junk food really? Junk foods are processed foods consisting of high calories, but that is considered only as a broad umbrella. These foods are prepared in a way that they look appealing and are enjoyable so you are chemically programmed to ask for more. According to Dr. Sunali Sharma, a Dietician & Nutritionist, \"Commercial products including salted snack foods, chewing gum, candy, sugary desserts, fried fast food, and sweetened carbonated beverages that have little or no nutritional value but are high in calories, salt, and fats may be considered junk foods. Though not all fast foods are junk foods, a great number of them are. For instance, a salad may be fast food but is definitely not junk food. Some foods like burgers, pizzas, and tacos may alternate between junk and healthy categories depending on the ingredients, calories and process of manufacturing.\" Frequent consumption of junk food increases the intake of excess fat, simple carbohydrates, and processed sugar which may lead to a higher risk of obesity and cardiovascular diseases, among other chronic health problems. The resulting obesity may begin clogging up the arteries and lay the basis of an impending heart attack. It has also been suggested that eating junk food affects the brain in the same way as consuming addictive drugs. An addiction to junk food may even result in the rejection of healthier food options like fruits, vegetables, salads etc. leading to further lack of nourishment.",

          "explanation": "The passage discusses about junk food, which is defined as processed foods with little nutritional value and high levels of salt, sugar, and fat. It clarifies the difference between junk food and fast food, stating that while not all fast food is junk food, many fast food items may fall into that category. The passage highlights the negative health effects of frequent junk food consumption, such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, and addiction-like responses in the brain. It also mentions how a reliance on junk food can lead to a rejection of healthier food options, resulting in inadequate nourishment."

          "explanation": "The pie chart displays the various sources of air pollution in a city, highlighting five key contributors. Vehicles are by far the most significant source, accounting for 60% of total air pollution. This indicates a heavy reliance on private and commercial transportation, possibly due to limited public transport infrastructure. Industry is the second-largest contributor at 18% , reflecting emissions from factories and manufacturing units. Power plants contribute 13% , suggesting that electricity generation—likely from fossil fuels—is another major pollutant. Waste disposal activities are responsible for 3% , while heating or using gas contributes nothing ( 0% ), showing negligible or highly controlled emissions in that category.\nThe disparity is stark: vehicles alone contribute more than all other sources combined, underscoring the urgent need for cleaner transport alternatives and stricter vehicular emission controls. In contrast, waste disposal and gas usage have a minimal impact, suggesting these are not major areas of concern. Targeted interventions in transport and industry could significantly improve air quality."

          "explanation": "Rina works in a big garment factory. There are more than five hundred workers in the factory. One day, as usual, she was busy at her work. Suddenly, she heard that there was a breakout of fire from a short-circuit. As ill news runs fast, within moments, panic spread throughout the factory. People screamed and rushed toward the exits in a state of confusion and fear.\nRina knew she had to stay calm. She quickly recalled the safety training she had received when she first joined the factory. She made her way to the emergency exit, but the crowd was so dense that it was difficult to move. She saw some of her co-workers struggling, and without thinking, she reached out to help them. Rina managed to guide a few of them toward the emergency stairwell, urging everyone to remain calm and not push or shove.\nMeanwhile, the fire was spreading rapidly, and thick smoke began to fill the air. The fire alarms were blaring, and the factory's emergency lights blinked on. Rina knew the workers must be evacuated immediately. She shouted instructions to others, urging them to follow the marked escape routes.\nThankfully, after what felt like an eternity, all the workers managed to get out safely. The fire brigade soon arrived and took control of the situation, putting out the flames. Although the factory was damaged, no lives were lost.\nRina felt a great sense of relief, but also a deep sense of responsibility. She had seen how quickly panic could spread, but also how important it was to stay calm in a crisis. She was proud of her quick thinking and the way everyone worked together to stay safe.\nThe incident left a lasting impression on Rina. She decided to join the factory’s safety committee to help improve emergency preparedness and ensure that such an event would never happen again. Rina’s courage and leadership that day made her a hero in the eyes of her fellow workers."

          "explanation": "Date: 23rd November 2024\nDear Shaon,\nI hope you're doing well. I am writing to share with you the excitement of our college's Annual Sports Day, which was held last week. It was an eventful day filled with enthusiasm, energy, and lots of fun. I thought you'd like to hear about it since you couldn't attend this year.\nThe event was held in our college ground, and the atmosphere was vibrant from the very beginning. The opening ceremony started with a grand march past by the various teams, each displaying their college pride. The principal gave a motivational speech, and the flag was raised to officially declare the sports day open. There were cheers and applause everywhere, and you could feel the spirit of competition in the air.\nThere were several exciting events, ranging from track and field to team sports like football and basketball. My favorite part was the 100-meter sprint. I participated in the race, and although I didn’t win, I felt proud of my effort. You know how much I enjoy running, and it was thrilling to compete against some of the best sprinters in the college.\nBesides that, there were tug-of-war competitions, relay races, and even a friendly cricket match. The teams were all well-prepared, and the support from the crowd was amazing. Everyone cheered for their friends, and the spirit of healthy competition was truly remarkable.\nThe day ended with a closing ceremony where the winners of the various events were awarded medals and trophies. There was so much joy in the air, and it was a wonderful way to celebrate the hard work and dedication of everyone who participated.\nI missed you a lot during the event. It would have been so much more fun if you had been there with me. Hopefully, you’ll be able to join us next year. Until then, I’ll keep you updated on all the happenings at college.\nTake care and write to me soon.\nYours truly, Zarin"
