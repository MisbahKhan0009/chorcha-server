(One is done for you.)\nAt daylight I was half wakened by the sound of chopping. Again it was so even in texture that went back to sleep. When I left my bed in the cool morning, the boy had come and gone, and a stack of kindling was neat against the cabin wall. He came arter school in the afternoon and worked until time to return to the orphanage. His name was Jerry ... he had been at the orphanage since he was four. I could picture him at four. with the same grave gray-blue eyes and the same independence? No, the word that comes to me is \"integrity\". ‥ It is bedded on courage, but it is more than brave. It is honest, but it is more than honesty. The ax handle broke one day. Jerry said the woodshop at the orphanage would repair it. I brought money to pay for the job and he refused it. \"I'll pay for it,\" he said. \"I broke it. I brought the ax down.careless.\" \"But no one hits accurately every time,\" I told him. \"The fault was in the wood of the handle. I'll see the man from whom I bought it.\" It was only then that he would take the money. He was standing back of his own carelessness. He was a free-will agent and he chose to do careful work, and if he failed, he took the responsibility without subterfuge.\nChopping wood in the morning→\n2. →\n3.→\n4.→\n5.\n6.",

(One is done for you)\nMeditation in our time is practiced by people to reduce stress and tension, and improve focus. There are trainers who help beginners with some exercises such as improved breathing and progressive relaxation. One of the most common approaches to meditation is concentration. To develop concentration one needs to focus on a single point. Since focusing the mind is challenging, a beginner might meditate for only a few minutes and then work up to longer durations. Meditation releases anxiety and brings a state of calmness. It increases the thinking ability of human brain so that people have a better control of their emotions. Those who practice meditation can work tirelessly for a longer period of time. Meditation helps improve blood circulation in the brain and other parts of the body. Finally, meditation improves creativity, self-awareness and tolerance.\n1. To reduce stress and tension, and improve focus →2 → 3 → 4→5 →6",

(One is done for you.)\nDreams have fascinated philosophers for thousands of years, but only recently have dreams been subjected to empirical research and scientific study. Chances are that you've often found yourself puzzling over the content of a dream, or perhaps you've' wondered why you dream at all. First, let's start by answering a basic question: What is a dream? A dream can include any of the images, thoughts and emotions that are experienced during sleep. Dreams. can be extraordinarily vivid or very vague; filled with joyful emotions or frightening images, focused and understandable or unclear and confusing.\nWhy do we dream? What purpose do dreams serve? While many theories have been proposed no consensus has emerged. Considering the time. we spend in a dreaming state, the fact that researchers do not yet understand the purpose of dreams may seem baffling. However, it is important to consider that science is still unraveling the exact purpose and function of sleep itself: Some researchers suggest that dreams serve no real purpose, while others believe that dreaming is essential to mental, emotional and physical well-being.\nNext, let's learn more about some of the most prominent dream theories. Consistent with the psychoanalytic perspective, Sigmund Freud's theory of dreams suggests that dreams are a representation of subconscious desires, thoughts and motivations. According to Freud, people are driven by aggressive and sexual instincts that are repressed from conscious awareness. While these thoughts are not consciously expressed, they find their way into our awareness via dreams. In his famous book The Interpretation of Dreams (1899). Freud wrote that dreams are \"..... disguised fulfilments of repressed wishes.\"\nFull of thoughts, images and emotions→\n2.→\n3.→\n4.→\n5.→\n6.",

In 2011 , the rate came down to 1.95 % 1.95 \\% 1.95% . Then the increase occurred in 2012 and the rate was 2.20 % 2.20 \\% 2.20% . Again, in 2013 the population rate decreased and came down to 1.35 % 1.35 \\% 1.35% . The graph indicates that the highest rate was population growth rate in 2009 was alarming while the rate in 2013 was encouraging.\nFrom the graph, it is clear that population growth rate decreased rapidly and remarkably over time and within a span of 5 years the population decreased more than a half, i.e. from 2.73 in 2009 to 1.35 in 2013. This is really an encouraging feature of population growth in the context of Bangladesh. I think this has been made possible because of some effective measures taken by the govt. to control the growth of population, like the family planning programme of having no more than 2 children."

Quarrels, ill-feelings, jealousy, enmity — all were part of everyday life there. No one seemed happy, and even small matters turned into big fights. Tired of the toxic atmosphere, the young man decided to leave.\nHe walked for days and finally reached a quiet, distant village nestled in the hills. The people there were kind, honest, and lived in harmony. There were no loud arguments, no envy in their hearts. The young man felt peace for the first time. He decided to settle there.\nYears passed, and he built a small home and started a family. But slowly, he noticed signs of tension among his neighbors—disagreements, misunderstandings, even jealousy. He was confused. “How did this happen?” he wondered. He reflected deeply and realized the truth: peace doesn’t come just from escaping problems—it must grow within.\nSo he changed himself. He practiced patience, spoke kindly, forgave easily, and helped others. Slowly, his behavior began to influence others. People started trusting one another again. Smiles returned to faces. The peace he once searched for outside had now been built from within.\nMoral: Peace isn’t a place you find—it’s something you create."

Set Realistic Goals : Set achievable goals for yourself, such as learning a certain number of new words each week or improving your pronunciation. Celebrate your progress along the way to stay motivated.\n4. Immerse Yourself : Surround yourself with English as much as possible. Watch English movies or TV shows, listen to English radio stations, and try to think in English. Immersion can significantly accelerate your learning process.\n5.
