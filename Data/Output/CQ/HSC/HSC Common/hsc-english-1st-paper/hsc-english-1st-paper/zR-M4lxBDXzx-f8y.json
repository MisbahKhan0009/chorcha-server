You must also have been taught to be polite in company and keep quiet while others, especially your elders, spoke. Possibly, you at times grudged such schooling. Possibly, at times you even protested such disciplining. Now, certainly you know that you can't always behave the way you want specially in the presence of others. There are rules of behavior you have to follow in a company. We are social beings and have to consider the effect of our behavior on others, even if we are at home and dealing with our family members.\nWe have two terms to describe our social behavior- 'etiquette' and 'manners'. 'Etiquette' is a French word and it means the rules of correct behavior in society. The word 'manners' means the behavior that is considered to be polite in a particular society or culture.\nManners can be good or bad. For example, it is a bad manner to speak with food in one's mouth. No one likes a bad mannered person. Remember that etiquette and manners vary from culture to culture and from society to society.",

          "explanation": "Summary:\nYou must have been taught as a young child to greet your elders and house guests in accordance with your culture and custom. Additionally, you must have been taught to be polite in public and to be silent when others, particularly your elders, spoke. Maybe you sometimes regretted your education. Maybe you even resisted such discipline at times. You are aware that you cannot always act in the way you like, especially when other people are present.\nEtiquette and manners are two words we use to describe how we behave in social situations. You can have good or awful manners. Speaking while chewing food, for instance, is impolite. A rude individual is not popular. Keep in mind that manners and etiquette differ from culture to culture and from society to society.\nEtiquette and manners are lessons we pick up from our parents, families, and other institutions like schools, colleges, or professional organisations."

      "uddipok": "Write a Summary of the following text:\nKuakata, locally known as Sagar Kannya (Daughter of the Sea) is a rare scenic spot located on the southernmost tip of Bangladesh. Kuakata in Latachapli union under Kalapara Police Station of Patuakhali district is about 30 km in length and 6 km in breadth. It is 70 km from Patuakhali district headquarters and 320 km from Dhaka. An excellent combination of the picturesque natural beauty, sandy beaches, blue sky and the shimmering expanse of water of the Bay of Bengal and the evergreen forest makes Kuakata a much sought after tourist destination. The name Kuakata takes its origin from the story of a 'Kua'-or well -dug on the sea shore by the early Rakhaine settlers for collecting drinking water. The Rakhaines had landed on Kuakata coast after being expelled from Arakan by the Mughals. Following the first well, it became a tradition to dig wells in the neighborhood of Rakhaine homesteads for fresh water supply.\nKuakata is one of the unique spots which allow a visitor to watch both the sunrise and the sunset from the beach. That perhaps makes Kuakata one of the world's most attractive beaches. The long and wide beach at Kuakata has a typical natural setting. This sandy beach slopes gently into the Bay and bathing there is as pleasant as is swimming or diving",

          "explanation": "Dreams, the ethereal landscapes of our subconscious minds, weave narratives that defy the constraints of reality. Within their realms, we encounter a symphony of sensations, where the boundaries of time and space blur effortlessly. Dreams serve as both playgrounds and laboratories, where the mind experiments with scenarios, emotions, and possibilities. They may reveal hidden fears, unspoken desires, or fragments of forgotten memories, offering glimpses into the labyrinthine depths of our psyche. In dreams, we may soar through boundless skies, confront formidable adversaries, or relive cherished moments from the past. They possess the power to inspire, to unsettle, or to enlighten, leaving us with lingering impressions long after we awaken. Within the enigmatic tapestry of our dreams, the subconscious speaks in a language of symbols and metaphors, inviting interpretation and introspection. Each dream, a unique fusion of imagination and introspection, invites us to ponder the mysteries of our innermost selves."

She lives on the income of what she gets from selling flowers. One day, while selling flowers in the traffic jam, Bithi noticed a commotion near a luxury car stopped at the signal. Curious, she edged closer, her small frame barely visible amidst the bustling crowd. As she approached, she saw a disheveled man arguing with the car's occupants. Suddenly, the man grabbed a purse from inside the car and darted away into the chaotic streets. Without a second thought, Bithi instinctively chased after him, her heart pounding with adrenaline. Dodging through the labyrinthine alleys and bustling markets, she pursued the thief, determination blazing in her eyes. Her nimble movements surprised even herself as she closed in on him, driven by a fierce resolve to reclaim what was stolen."

      "uddipok": "Summarize the following text.\nMany adolescents face pressure to use alcohol, cigarettes, or other drugs and to initiate sexual relationships putting\nthemselves at high risk for intentional and unintentłonal injuries, unintended pregnancies, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Many also experience a wide range of adjustment and mental health problems. Behaviour patterns that are established during this period such as the use or avoidance of drugs and taking or abstaining from sexual risk can have long-lasting negative and positive effects on future health and well-being. As a result, adults have unique opportunities to influence adolescents. Adolescents are different both from young children and adults. Specifically, adolescents are not fully capable of understanding complex concepts, or the relationship between behaviour and consequences, or the degree of control they have or can have over health decision-making, including that related to sexual behaviour. This inability may make them particularly vulnerable to sexual exploitation and high-risk behaviours. Laws, customs, and practices may also affect adolescents differently than adults. For example, laws and policies often restrict adolescents' access to reproductive health information and services, especially when they are unmarried. In addition, even when services do exist, provider attitudes about adolescents often pose a significant barrier to the use of those services.",

          "explanation": "This passage highlights on the critical moments of adolescents, and the complexity and pressures they face during adolescence period. This phase is so critical since he/she has to face difficulties to adjust with them. They face life-destructing pressures and a wide range of mental and health problems. Also, this period is the shaper of his/her future with negative or positive effects. Adolescents are unable to perceive the complex concepts of life. Therefore, they become very vulnerable to high-risk behaviours and sexual exploitation. There are some restrictions and laws imposed on them to control or prevent them from going astray. As this phase is so critical for them, adults and other concerned authorities should be aware to guide them in the right direction."
