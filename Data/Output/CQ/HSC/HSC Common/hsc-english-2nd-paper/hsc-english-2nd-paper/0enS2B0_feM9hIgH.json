I am writing to you as a concerned student of 'N' College, deeply moved by the recent havoc caused by the floods in our locality. The devastating impact of the floods has left many families homeless, deprived of basic necessities, and in dire need of assistance.\nIn light of this situation, I, along with several fellow students, believe it is imperative for our college to take proactive steps to extend a helping hand to the flood-affected people in our community. Therefore, I am earnestly requesting your kind consideration in opening a relief camp within our college premises.\nA relief camp would serve as a central hub for organizing and coordinating relief efforts, allowing us to collect essential supplies such as food, clean water, clothing, and medical supplies. Moreover, it would provide a safe haven for those displaced by the floods, offering temporary shelter and basic amenities until they can return to their homes.\nBy establishing a relief camp, not only will we be able to provide immediate assistance to those in need, but we will also demonstrate our college's commitment to social responsibility and community service. It will be a powerful statement of solidarity and compassion, showcasing the values that we as students of 'N' College uphold.\nI assure you that myself and a dedicated team of volunteers are ready to spearhead the organization and management of the relief camp, working closely with college authorities and local authorities to ensure its smooth operation.\nI kindly request your approval and support in this endeavor, as well as any necessary resources and assistance from the college administration. Together, we can make a significant difference in the lives of those affected by the floods and demonstrate the spirit of unity and empathy that defines our college community.\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I eagerly await your positive response.\nWarm regards,\nArif\nStudent, 'N' College"

Rural areas are adorned with natural beauty while urban areas are adorned only with numerous highrise attractive buildings. City life being furnished (সজ্জিত) with modern facilities, city-dwellers can enjoy better life. Here people get better medical facilities; better education, good sanitation, advanced communication and transport system, better recreation and most importantly better opportunities for employment, and making money through business and trade. On the contrary, rural people are deprived (বঞ্চিত) of good medical facilities, better scopes of getting good education, enjoying rapid and comfortable (আরামদায়ক) travelling or movement, running business and trade. Because here there are no good educational instructions, good hospitals with highly skilled and experienced doctors good road networks. On the other hand, cities are the hub (চক্রকেন্দ্র) of business and cotmmercial activities. Here, there is a great number of mills and factories, offices, shopping malls, supermarkets, etc. Consequently (অতএব), huge number of people get employment facilities. Urban people can pass pleasant time in zoo, parks, museums (জাদুঘর), theatres, cinema halls, clubs and some other attractive places. Contrarily, rural people bereft of these things, spend their time gossiping, playing or watching. TV. But city life is full of hustle and bustle (তাড়াহুড়া ও ছুটছুটি) and afflicted (পীড়িত) with pollution. Here people become sick due to various types of pollution. They cannot have pure and fresh foods. On the contrary, rural life being free of hustle and bustle and mechanical business, people here live a peaceful life. Rural people being simple and easy-going, they live in peace and amity with others. But their peaceful life often becomes disturbed owing to village politics. However, city life surpasses (অতিক্রম করা) rural life by virtue of various advantages. So, it is always attractive and appealing (আবেদনময়)."
