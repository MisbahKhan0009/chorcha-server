          "explanation": "To: rafia@gmail.com\nSubject: About the importance of attending multi-media class.\nDear Rafia,\nI have been frustrated to know that you are indifferent of multi-media class in your school. You know it's an up-to-date teaching-learning method. In this method print texts, film, graphics, animation, projector, sound system and internet are used in teaching Multi-media classroom provides the students with chances for interacting with diverse information that give, them a solid background in the tasks and content of mainstream college course. With the help of multi-media, the teachers can give more opportunity to students to express their opinions and enjoy the course. Multi-media classrooms have different settings from traditional classrooms. In traditional classrooms there is a chalkboard in the front. But in multi-media classroom there is a large screen in the front where lessons are taught through slide show, Here students feel comfortable to study. So the importance of attending multi-media class cannot be ignored anymore. If you ignore it, you will surely lag behind. So I suggest you to attend multi-media class in the school regularly.\nYour elder brother\nGazi Sharif"

          "explanation": "Bangabandhu Satellite-1\nA satellite refers to an artificial body placed in orbit around the earth or another planet in order to collect information or for communication. The Bangabandhu Satellite-1 is the first Bangladeshi geostationary communications Satellite. The Satellite has been named after the father of the nation, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. It was designed and manufactured by Thales Alenia Space and its launch provider was SpaceX. Its launch station was Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, USA and the ground control stations are in Betbunia and Gazipur in Bangladesh. The satellite was expected to be located at the 119.1 East longitude geostationary slot. With a total mass of 3700 k g 3700 \\mathrm{~kg} 3700 kg and powered by 2 deployable solar arrays and batteries, the expected longevity of the satellite is 15 years. The satellite provides Ku-band and C-band television broadcast and data relay services across Bangladesh and neighboring areas. This satellite will bring about enormous development and uninterrupted telecommunication system in Bangladesh. At present, the country's television channels have been renting bandwidth from Chinese, Indian and Singaporean satellites at a cost of about 14 million a year. It is expected that Bangladesh will not only save such amount of money in the future, but also would earn a lot by letting other countries to lease the unused bandwidth. The launch of satellite Bangabandhu-1 by Bangladesh brings both prospects and challenges as it is expected to help the country save Foreign currency, while the challenges remain in effectively running the venture."

          "question": "",
          "explanation": "The aim in life is really important because an aimless person is like a rudderless ship in the sea and does not know the direction of their destination. Likewise, if we also don’t have an aim in our life, we won’t know where to reach. Thus to achieve it one has to overcome many obstacles and setbacks from time to time. I always wanted to be a professor and now my family is inspiring me to become a professor too. My parents are really supportive and they respect my decision. I have seen lots of my friends want to become a professor, and some of them want to pursue an MBA . There are a lot of aims and goals available that students can choose in their lives. Right now in this world, the top trending professions are Doctor, Teacher, Programmer, Designer, Architect, Marketer, Supervisor, Manager, Engineer, etc. Maybe you have something unique in you and you want to pursue that. So different people adopt different aims according to their inclinations, tastes or perceptions about life. My teachers are really helpful and are always guiding and helping me with my future plans.\nThey have always inspired me to do better and work harder. I was once explaining some doubts to my classmates and I realized that I really like explaining and teaching. Later, I experienced teaching while doing an internship with an NGO. I went to a slum and taught kids there. I felt a different kind of satisfaction after teaching them. At that time I realized that I had never felt happier than this and decided to become a professor. I am one who enjoys exploring new places and getting to know new cultures, languages, and cuisines, and working as a professor offers many chances for me to develop those interests. After my English Honours degree, I will prepare for the Master’s degree. Then I am planning to take the UGC NET exam. Another big plus is the working hours that academia can offer, which are frequently more flexible than in other professions.\nThe biggest advantage of being a professor is that I find jobs in many places worldwide. I am really honest and passionate about my aim in life. It is surely a long journey but I will try my best to reach my goal and I suggest everyone do the same. According to me, timely execution of an action plan with a proactive attitude is the key to success. One of the best ways to stay motivated is by visualizing the change and likewise by achieving step-by-step milestones."
