          "explanation": "Top Five Jobs that I am Aiming at\nI have always been very passionate about exploring diverse range of careers. So, there are a few different jobs that I am aiming at and I believe getting any one of them would help me excel professionally. Firstly, I want to become a teacher. From a young age, I developed a habit of reading story books and finished reading the most famous literary works in no time. I find the world of literature immensely fascinating and dream of becoming a teacher to teach students about this world. Secondly, I like the job of a researcher as well. Research can be quite an extensive task but there is a certain joy to finding new information, analyzing data and presenting a topic in front of others. Thirdly, I want to aim towards the business sector and preferably get the job of a market analyst. With the growing economy, it will be a difficult yet beneficial duty to work as a market analyst to analyze the condition of the market. After that, I have a keen interest in photography as well. Last year, I entered a photo competition and won second prize. Afterwards, I attended a few workshops and occasionally experimented with photography. It is certainly more than just clicking a button. Lastly,'I want to become a journalist and cover breaking news for the audience. The journey to reach where I am aiming is not going to be easy. I hope and believe that I will be able to continue working hard to reach my goal."

          "explanation": "My Dreams and My Realities\nA dream is similar to wishing for something to happen or to have an ambitious goal. This wish may or may not come true, but the strong desire behind it helps a person continue dreaming. There are many different kinds of dreams. Someone dreams of learning to play a guitar while someone dreams of buying a house. On the other hand, reality is the state of how things exist. Reality leaves no scope for assumption since it represents everything as they are. At times, dreams and realities clash with each other. For example, my dream is to read all the books in the world. But the reality is that there are so many books in the world that it is not possible for me to read every ore of them. I also have a dream that one day I will live in a traffic jam free Dhaka. There is no guarantee whether Dhaka will be able to reduce its traffic congestion in the future. But at the moment, the reality is that Dhaka is a densely populated city and the population in the country is rapidly growing by day. Consequently, my dreams are most likely to remain unfulfilled. However, some dreams can be achieved with hard work and dedication. Being good at sports used to be a dream of mine. Now I can play cricket, football, badminton, tennis and various other types of sports due to the reason that I participated and practiced for a long period of time. My reality was that I did not know how to play these games but I remained persistent. Therefore, a person should always keep dreaming and look for ways to make the dream come true."
