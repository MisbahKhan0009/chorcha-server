As we look around, we discover beauty in pleasurable objects and sights-in nature, in the laughter of children, in the kindness of strangers . But asked to define, we run into difficulties. Does beauty have an independent objective identity? Is it universal , or is it dependent on our sense perceptions ? Does it lie in the eye of the beholder ?- we ask ourselves. A further difficulty arises when beauty manifests itself not only by its presence, but by its absence as well, as when we are repulsed by ugliness and desire beauty. But then ugliness has as much a place in our lives as beauty, or may be more as when there is widespread hunger and injustice in a society.

          "explanation": "The International Mother Language Day\nMother language means a language through which the people of a country express their ideas, thoughts, feelings and emotions clearly. The 21st February is the International Mother Language Day. In order to show due honour and respect to the existing mother languages of different countries, the day has been declared as International Mother Language Day by UNESCO. In reply to a proposal from Bangladesh Govt., the declaration has come to reality. The day has a long glorious historical background (পটতৃমি). It is a matter of great regret that the then rulers of Pakistan tried to impose \"Urdu' as the state language upon us instead of Bangla. Before the independence of our country in 1952, the then Pakistani ruler Jinnah declared in the public meeting that \"Urdu and only Urdu shall be the state language of Pakistan.\". The people of our country burst into (ফ্টে পড়া) protest against this unjustified decision. Some of the heroic sons of this soil came forward and sacrificed their valuable lives for the cause of the mother tongue on the 21 st February. 1952. The objective of observing the day is to pay homage to the language martyrs. The day is greatly important for the people of Bangladesh. Now, it is a matter of great pleasure and prestige that this day got international recognition (ন্বীकৃতি) in 1999 as International Mother Language Day."

          "explanation": "Causes and Effects of Unemployment in Bangladesh\nUnemployment refers to the state of a person, capable of working, unable to find a paid job. In Bangladesh, unemployment still remains as one of the significant challenges. In order to address this issue hindering economic growth, the causes of unemployment need to be explored first. Rapid population growth is a major factor behind the unemployment rate. In comparison to the population, there are not enough job opportunities in the market. So, when a fresh graduate or anyone from the working-age enters the job market, the competition is quite fierce for a single seat. On the other hand, due to the digitalization of the country, laborers are being replaced with machines in the work field. Although automation helps businesses by improving its productivity and accuracy, it leaves a gap in the job market by reducing job opportunities. Lack of proper training and workoriented education are some of the other contributing factors regarding unemployment. The effect of unemployment falls directly on the economy of the country. Without a source of an income, unemployed people fail to provide themselves and their families with basic necessities. As a result, their standard of living meets no improvement. The pressure of finding a job and affording expenses collectively may cause extreme mental health issues for the people involved. It is a serious issue that the government cannot fix alone; we should all come forward to build a better nation by reducing unemployment in the country."
