But sadly there are many poor but meritorious students whose education process gets hindered due to poverty. We want to help those students so that they can carry on their studies smoothly (মসৃণকারী) and undisturbed. With this end in view, we want to initiate a fund (তহবিল) raising programme in our college. Initially we will raise a fund to which every student of our college will contribute. Then with the money we will conduct an honesty shop and make a garden. The profits from these two sources will be used to help those poor but meritorious students. I hope this will enable them to carry on their studies normally and make glorious results in the public exams.\nI. therefore, pray and hope that you would be kind and considerate (সহানুভূতিশীল) enough to grant our prayer and oblige thereby.\nYours obediently\nShafollo\nOn behalf of the students of Class XII"

          "explanation": "The Impact of Facebook on the Young Generation\nIn the digital age, social media platforms have become an integral part of the daily lives of millions worldwide. Among these, Facebook stands out as one of the most prominent and influential platforms, especially among the young generation. However, the impact of Facebook on today's youth is a subject of ongoing debate, with both positive and negative effects being observed.\nPositive Influence:\nFacebook has undoubtedly revolutionized the way young people communicate, connect, and share information. It serves as a virtual social hub, enabling users to stay connected with friends and family, regardless of geographical distances. Through Facebook, young individuals can maintain relationships, share updates about their lives, and express themselves creatively through photos, videos, and posts.\nMoreover, Facebook facilitates networking and provides opportunities for socialization. Many young people use Facebook to join groups and communities based on shared interests, hobbies, or causes. These online communities offer a sense of belonging and camaraderie, fostering friendships and collaborations that transcend physical boundaries.\nAdditionally, Facebook has emerged as a powerful platform for learning and awareness. It provides access to a vast repository of information, news, and educational resources. Young users can engage with informative content, participate in discussions, and broaden their perspectives on various issues.\nNegative Influence:\nDespite its many benefits, Facebook also exerts several negative influences on the young generation. One of the primary concerns is the impact on mental health. Excessive use of Facebook has been linked to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety among young users. The constant exposure to curated versions of others' lives on social media can lead to unrealistic comparisons and feelings of inadequacy.\nFurthermore, Facebook can be a breeding ground for cyberbullying and online harassment. Young people may face peer pressure, criticism, or harassment from their peers, which can have detrimental effects on their self-esteem and well-being.\nAnother significant issue associated with Facebook is its potential for addiction. The platform's addictive features, such as likes, comments, and notifications, can lead to compulsive usage patterns, detracting from real-world interactions and productivity.\nMoreover, concerns have been raised about the impact of Facebook on privacy and data security. Young users may unknowingly expose personal information or fall victim to online scams and phishing attacks, posing risks to their safety and security.\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, Facebook wields a profound influence on the young generation, shaping their social interactions, behaviors, and perceptions. While it offers numerous benefits in terms of connectivity, information sharing, and community building, it also poses challenges related to mental health, privacy, and online safety. Therefore, it is imperative for young users, parents, educators, and policymakers to recognize the dual nature of Facebook's impact and work towards promoting responsible and mindful usage of social media platforms."
