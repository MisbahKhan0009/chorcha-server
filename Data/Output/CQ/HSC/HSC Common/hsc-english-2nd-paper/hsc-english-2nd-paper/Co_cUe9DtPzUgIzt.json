          "explanation": "The Backstage during a Cultural Show\nThe backstage is an important part of executing a cultural show. An audience, during a show, only sees the activities on the stage. But behind the stage, there are other people besides the performers and a few additional instrumentalists working on the production of the show. Usually there is a stage manager who looks over the entire operation. Under a stage manager's supervision, light and sound technicians work on their assigned jobs. There are also makeup artists helping the performers get ready before they appear on the stage. Laughter can be heard from somewhere and there would be performers encouraging one another. Sometimes dancers work on their last minute practices and singers work on warming their vocals. Although the stage welcomes one performer or a group of performers at a time, the backstage becomes a home to everyone involved. As a result, the environment cannot but get a little chaotic. Amidst the rush, every task is handled with caution. Everyone is focused on their specific task, so even if there is chaos, it is kept well under control. When it is about time for the show to commence, the stage manager assists the performers in getting on the stage within their designated slot. Tension, excitement and anticipation can be sensed in the air backstage as performers await their turn. Cultural expression comes to life on the stage through various performances with the assistance of a dedicated team working behind the scene. Once the show is over, the duty of the backstage is over as well."

          "explanation": "The City Life and Country Life\nThe difference between county life and city life is strikingly (আকর্ষণীয়ভাবে) remarkable (উল্লেখযোগ্য). Rural areas are adorned with natural beauty while urban areas are adorned only with numerous highrise attractive buildings. City life being furnished (সজ্জিত) with modern facilities, city-dwellers can enjoy better life. Here people get better medical facilities; better education, good sanitation, advanced communication and transport system, better recreation and most importantly better opportunities for employment, and making money through business and trade. On the contrary, rural people are deprived (বঞ্চিত) of good medical facilities, better scopes of getting good education, enjoying rapid and comfortable (আরামদায়ক) travelling or movement, running business and trade. Because here there are no good educational instructions, good hospitals with highly skilled and experienced doctors good road networks. On the other hand, cities are the hub (চক্রকেন্দ্র) of business and cotmmercial activities. Here, there is a great number of mills and factories, offices, shopping malls, supermarkets, etc. Consequently (অতএব), huge number of people get employment facilities. Urban people can pass pleasant time in zoo, parks, museums (জাদুঘর), theatres, cinema halls, clubs and some other attractive places. Contrarily, rural people bereft of these things, spend their time gossiping, playing or watching. TV. But city life is full of hustle and bustle (তাড়াহুড়া ও ছুটছুটি) and afflicted (পীড়িত) with pollution. Here people become sick due to various types of pollution. They cannot have pure and fresh foods. On the contrary, rural life being free of hustle and bustle and mechanical business, people here live a peaceful life. Rural people being simple and easy-going, they live in peace and amity with others. But their peaceful life often becomes disturbed owing to village politics. However, city life surpasses (অতিক্রম করা) rural life by virtue of various advantages. So, it is always attractive and appealing (আবেদনময়)."
