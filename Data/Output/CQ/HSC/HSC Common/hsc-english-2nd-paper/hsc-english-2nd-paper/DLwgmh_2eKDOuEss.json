I have brought nothing warm to wear: it is all down at the hotel in Urumqi. Rain begins to fall. The man behind me is eating overpoweringly smelly goat’s cheese. The bus window leaks inhospitably but reveals a beautiful view. We have passed quickly from desert through arable land to pasture, and the ground is now green with grass, the slopes dark with pine. A few cattle drink at a clear stream flowing past moss-covered stones; it is a Constable landscape. The stream changes into a white torrent, and as we climb higher I wish more and more that I had brought with me something warmer than the pair of shorts that have served me so well in the desert. The stream (which, we are told, rises in Heaven Lake) disappears, and we continue our slow ascent. About noon, we arrive at Heaven Lake and look for a place to stay at the foot, which is the resort area.

          "explanation": "Digital Bangladesh\n\"Digital Bangladesh\" is a visionary initiative launched by the government of Bangladesh to transform the country into a knowledge-based society through the use of information and communication technology (ICT). The concept, introduced by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 2008, aims to harness the power of digital technology to improve various sectors, such as education, healthcare, governance, and business, thereby promoting overall national development. One of the key aspects of Digital Bangladesh is the expansion of internet connectivity across the country, including rural areas, which has enabled millions of people to access information, communicate, and participate in the digital economy.\nThe government has made significant investments in building infrastructure for digital services, including the development of e-governance systems, digital banking, and online education platforms. These initiatives have not only increased the efficiency of public services but have also provided greater transparency and accountability. In education, online learning platforms and digital classrooms have made learning more accessible, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, when schools shifted to virtual classes.\nFurthermore, the rise of the digital economy has created new opportunities for young entrepreneurs in e-commerce, freelancing, and digital marketing. The government's efforts to develop digital skills among the youth through training programs have led to an increase in the number of IT professionals, contributing to the country’s growing tech industry.\nDespite the progress, challenges remain, such as digital literacy gaps, cybersecurity concerns, and the need for further infrastructure development in remote areas. However, the vision of Digital Bangladesh continues to evolve, aiming for an inclusive, technology-driven future for all its citizens."

          "explanation": "Causes and Effects of Unemployment in Bangladesh\nUnemployment refers to the state of a person, capable of working, unable to find a paid job. In Bangladesh, unemployment still remains as one of the significant challenges. In order to address this issue hindering economic growth, the causes of unemployment need to be explored first. Rapid population growth is a major factor behind the unemployment rate. In comparison to the population, there are not enough job opportunities in the market. So, when a fresh graduate or anyone from the working-age enters the job market, the competition is quite fierce for a single seat. On the other hand, due to the digitalization of the country, laborers are being replaced with machines in the work field. Although automation helps businesses by improving its productivity and accuracy, it leaves a gap in the job market by reducing job opportunities. Lack of proper training and workoriented education are some of the other contributing factors regarding unemployment. The effect of unemployment falls directly on the economy of the country. Without a source of an income, unemployed people fail to provide themselves and their families with basic necessities. As a result, their standard of living meets no improvement. The pressure of finding a job and affording expenses collectively may cause extreme mental health issues for the people involved. It is a serious issue that the government cannot fix alone; we should all come forward to build a better nation by reducing unemployment in the country."
