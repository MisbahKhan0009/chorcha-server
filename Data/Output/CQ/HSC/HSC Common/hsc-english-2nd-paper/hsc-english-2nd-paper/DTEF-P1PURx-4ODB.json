As a student of [Your Course/Department] at X College, I am writing to bring to your attention a proposal that I believe will significantly enhance the learning experience for all students: the introduction of multimedia facilities in classrooms.\nIn today's digital age, traditional teaching methods are being complemented, and in many cases replaced, by interactive and multimedia-based learning techniques. The integration of multimedia resources such as projectors, smart boards, and audiovisual equipment can greatly enrich the educational experience by making lessons more engaging, interactive, and accessible to diverse learning styles.\nMultimedia facilities in classrooms would enable instructors to incorporate a variety of teaching aids such as educational videos, interactive presentations, and digital simulations into their lectures. This would not only capture the attention of students but also facilitate better understanding and retention of complex concepts.\nMoreover, multimedia facilities can accommodate different learning preferences and cater to the needs of students with varying abilities, ensuring a more inclusive learning environment. Additionally, the use of multimedia technology fosters creativity and critical thinking skills among students by encouraging them to explore, analyze, and synthesize information in innovative ways.\nI believe that the introduction of multimedia facilities in classrooms aligns with X College's commitment to providing quality education and preparing students for success in a rapidly evolving world. Therefore, I urge you to consider this proposal favorably and take the necessary steps to implement multimedia facilities in our college classrooms.\nThank you for considering my suggestion. I am confident that this initiative will greatly benefit the academic community at X College and contribute to the overall enhancement of our educational experience.\nYours sincerely,\n[Your Name] [Your Course/Department] [Your Roll/ID Number]"

          "explanation": "The Celebration of Pahela Boishakh\nPahela Boishakh is the first day of Bangla year. In fact, it is the day of welcoming the Bangla New Year. It is part and parcel of Bengali culture and tradition (ঐতিহ্য). So, the day is observed with traditional festivity (উল্লাস) across the country. People in villages celebrate this day as per their agelong customs. Special meals are arranged at home and Boishakhi Melas are held in different places. It is a day of great pleasure to the village people and children. City dwellers (নগরবাসী) also celebrate this day with delight. Girls and women put on yellow saris and boys put on pajamapanjabi. Some people eat watered-rice with onion, green chilli and hilsha fish. Shopkeepers in both towns and villages open new accounts books (হালখাতা) and offer sweets to their customers and this is the most impressive part of the celebration. Different cultural organizations offer different programmes. The celebration of Pahela Boishakh bears a great importance for us. It is passed by holding and enjoying festive programmes and functions. People living in Dhaka attend the Gano Sangeeter Ashor at Ramna Batamul in the morning. We reap great benefits from this kind of festival. It makes us stick to our traditional native culture. At the same time, it strengthens national unity making us forget the differences of religion, colour, race, etc. On this day, we get inspired to forget all the sorrows and failures (ব্যর্থতা) of the past year and to start a new life. with new vigour (বলিষ্ঠতা) and inspiration."

          "question": "",
          "explanation": "\nEarly marriage—defined as marriage before the age of 18—is a persistent challenge in Bangladesh. Approximately 51% of girls marry before turning 18, the highest rate in South Asia and eighth highest globally (link.springer.com). Root causes are deeply woven into poverty , patriarchal norms , the dowry system , and concerns about girls’ safety. Poor rural families often perceive daughters as economic burdens and arrange early marriages to reduce expenses and dowry demands . Families also believe marriage offers security from premarital relationships or harassment .\nThe effects are profound: girls forced into early marriage frequently drop out of school, limiting their future opportunities (observerbd.com). Early pregnancy poses serious health risks—complications such as postpartum hemorrhage, high maternal and infant mortality, malnutrition, and anemia are common among teenage mothers (en.bonikbarta.com). Disrupted education also stunts girls’ personal and economic growth, reinforcing cycles of poverty and social inequality (observerbd.com). Additionally, early marriage increases vulnerability to intimate partner violence and limits young women’s agency in health and family decisions (link.springer.com).\nAddressing early marriage in Bangladesh requires a multifaceted approach: enforce laws like the Child Marriage Restraint Act more rigorously, improve girls’ access to education and economic resources, and drive cultural change through awareness campaigns targeting traditional norms ."

For many different reasons, English has achieved the prestige of being that language. As a result, it has crossed national borders to reach people who speak other languages. It is no longer the unique possession of British or American people, but a language that belongs to the world's people. In fact, bilingual and multilingual users of English far outnumber its monolingual native speakers. This phenomenon has led to a bewildering variety of English around the world. As more and more people speak English, more and more varieties have emerged which are strongly influenced by the pronunciation, grammar and idioms of the respective mother tongues. World English has now moved away from the control of the native speakers. However, the question of British or American English is not so important now. Today's slogan is mutual intelligibility among users of the language.\n\n(a) obviously (synonym); (b) obviously (antonym); (c) prestige (synonym); (d) phenomenon (synonym); (e) unique (antonym); (f) belong (synonym); (g) outnumber (synonym); (h) monolingual (antonym); (i) native (antonym); (j) variety (synonym); (k) emerge (antonym); (l) control (antonym) (m) bewildering (synonym); (n) intelligibility (antonym).",
