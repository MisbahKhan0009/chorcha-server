For many different reasons, English has achieved the prestige of being that language. As a result, it has crossed national borders to reach people who speak other languages. It is no longer the unique possession of British or American people, but a language that belongs to the world's people. In fact, bilingual and multilingual users of English far outnumber its monolingual native speakers. This phenomenon has led to a bewildering variety of English around the world. As more and more people speak English, more and more varieties have emerged which are strongly influenced by the pronunciation, grammar and idioms of the respective mother tongues. World English has now moved away from the control of the native speakers. However, the question of British or American English is not so important now.

It is essential for every individual to have access to clean and safe drinking water, especially in an educational environment.\nTherefore, I kindly request you to take the necessary steps to ensure that safe drinking water is available on the college campus.

It has connected the capital with 21 southern districts of Bangladesh. It is 6.15 kilometres long and 18.18 metres wide. It has 41 spans on 42 pillars. The cost of the mega project is Tk. 30,193.39 crore. This mega project is being funded from the own resources of the government of Bangladesh. It is a truss bridge and the material of the bridge is steel. The bridge has increased connectivity beyond the boundary. It has established direct road communication between Dhaka and the southern parts of the country. It has opened up huge possibilities in the tourism (পর্যটন) sectors in Bangladesh. Traders can take their goods directly to the capital. They can make profit by supplying their fresh products to the buyers. The bridge has cut the travel time between Dhaka and Mongla Port. It will reduce overall poverty and contribute to industrial development, regional trade, agricultural expansion, etc. Soon after its inauguration of the Padma Bridge by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on 25 June 2022.15,200 vehicles cross it in the first 8 hours. A total of 24000 vehicles cross the Padma Bridge every day. The bridge has ensured the increase of GDP growth rate by more than 1%. Due to poor connectivity economic operation in the south-western zone has not been too easy. Consequently (অতএব), the districts did not seize much industrialization (শিল্পায়ন). As a result, poverty and unemployment constitute major problem in this region. However, the Padma Bridge will offer many advantages to the region. It will unveil the door of opportunity for industrialization which will remove unemployment problem."

          "explanation": "Failure in English can stem from various causes, ranging from lack of proficiency to inadequate study habits or external factors. One primary cause is a deficiency in foundational language skills, including grammar, vocabulary, and comprehension, which can impede a student's ability to grasp and communicate effectively in English. Additionally, limited exposure to English-speaking environments or resources can hinder language acquisition and fluency. Poor study habits, such as procrastination or lack of practice, also contribute to failure as consistent effort and engagement are essential for mastery. Furthermore, external factors like socio-economic disparities or inadequate educational support can exacerbate challenges in learning English, particularly for marginalized communities. The effects of failure in English are multifaceted, extending beyond academic repercussions to impact future opportunities and self-esteem. Academic setbacks, including low grades or inability to meet language requirements, can hinder educational advancement and career prospects. Moreover, language barriers may impede communication and integration in diverse social and professional settings, limiting opportunities for personal and professional growth. Ultimately, addressing the root causes of failure in English requires holistic support systems that encompass effective teaching methodologies, equitable access to resources, and socio-economic empowerment."
