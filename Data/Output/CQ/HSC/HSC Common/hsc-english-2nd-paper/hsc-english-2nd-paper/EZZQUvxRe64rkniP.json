I am writing to you, on behalf of the students of Dhaka College, to propose the establishment of an English Language Club within the college premises.\nAs a second-year college student, I have observed a growing interest among my peers in improving their English language skills. However, we feel that our current academic curriculum may not adequately cater to the practical aspects of language learning, such as speaking and listening proficiency.\nThe proposed English Language Club would serve as a platform for students to enhance their English language abilities through various interactive activities, such as debates, discussions, public speaking sessions, and language games. Additionally, the club could organize workshops, seminars, and guest lectures by language experts to provide valuable insights and guidance.\nMoreover, the English Language Club would foster a sense of camaraderie among students with a shared interest in language learning, promoting cultural exchange and mutual support.\nWe believe that the establishment of an English Language Club would complement our academic endeavors and contribute to our personal and professional development. Therefore, we earnestly request your support and approval for this initiative.\nThank you for considering our proposal. We look forward to your positive response and guidance on how to proceed further with this endeavor.\nSincerely,\nMotin\n[Your Signature]"

          "explanation": "The Celebration of Pahela Boishakh\nPahela Boishakh is the first day of Bangla year. In fact, it is the day of welcoming the Bangla New Year. It is part and parcel of Bengali culture and tradition (ঐতিহ্য). So, the day is observed with traditional festivity (উল্লাস) across the country. People in villages celebrate this day as per their agelong customs. Special meals are arranged at home and Boishakhi Melas are held in different places. It is a day of great pleasure to the village people and children. City dwellers (নগরবাসী) also celebrate this day with delight. Girls and women put on yellow saris and boys put on pajamapanjabi. Some people eat watered-rice with onion, green chilli and hilsha fish. Shopkeepers in both towns and villages open new accounts books (হালখাতা) and offer sweets to their customers and this is the most impressive part of the celebration. Different cultural organizations offer different programmes. The celebration of Pahela Boishakh bears a great importance for us. It is passed by holding and enjoying festive programmes and functions. People living in Dhaka attend the Gano Sangeeter Ashor at Ramna Batamul in the morning. We reap great benefits from this kind of festival. It makes us stick to our traditional native culture. At the same time, it strengthens national unity making us forget the differences of religion, colour, race, etc. On this day, we get inspired to forget all the sorrows and failures (ব্যর্থতা) of the past year and to start a new life. with new vigour (বলিষ্ঠতা) and inspiration."

Rural areas are adorned with natural beauty while urban areas are adorned only with numerous highrise attractive buildings. City life being furnished (সজ্জিত) with modern facilities, city-dwellers can enjoy better life. Here people get better medical facilities; better education, good sanitation, advanced communication and transport system, better recreation and most importantly better opportunities for employment, and making money through business and trade. On the contrary, rural people are deprived (বঞ্চিত) of good medical facilities, better scopes of getting good education, enjoying rapid and comfortable (আরামদায়ক) travelling or movement, running business and trade. Because here there are no good educational instructions, good hospitals with highly skilled and experienced doctors good road networks. On the other hand, cities are the hub (চক্রকেন্দ্র) of business and cotmmercial activities. Here, there is a great number of mills and factories, offices, shopping malls, supermarkets, etc. Consequently (অতএব), huge number of people get employment facilities. Urban people can pass pleasant time in zoo, parks, museums (জাদুঘর), theatres, cinema halls, clubs and some other attractive places. Contrarily, rural people bereft of these things, spend their time gossiping, playing or watching. TV. But city life is full of hustle and bustle (তাড়াহুড়া ও ছুটছুটি) and afflicted (পীড়িত) with pollution. Here people become sick due to various types of pollution. They cannot have pure and fresh foods. On the contrary, rural life being free of hustle and bustle and mechanical business, people here live a peaceful life. Rural people being simple and easy-going, they live in peace and amity with others. But their peaceful life often becomes disturbed owing to village politics. However, city life surpasses (অতিক্রম করা) rural life by virtue of various advantages. So, it is always attractive and appealing (আবেদনময়)."
