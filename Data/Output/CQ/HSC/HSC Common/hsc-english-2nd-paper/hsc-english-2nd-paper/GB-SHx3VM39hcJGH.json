They often taunt and tease college going youths especially the girls, hijack various vehicles, cheat the shopkeepers, give no fare to the rickshaw pullers, and behave roughly towards people and passers-by (পথচারী). Things turn worse after the sunset. They gather at the intersections (মোড়) of roads and footpaths to take narcotics such as hashish, phenyl, soporific drugs, and heroin. They sell various unauthorized things like forbidden drugs, illegal weapons, etc. here and there. Then they prey on passers-by and snatch away their belongings. Some people have been stabbed (ছুরিকাঘাত) and some others have been compelled to give them extortions. They have even threatened some persons with killing. So, we are all living in a frustrating (হতাশায়) situation with a premonition (পূর্বজ্ঞান) that conditions may deteriorate further.\nCommunity leaders and elderly citizens have tried to persuade them to come back to sense and stop bullying (গুন্ডামি) people. But they pay no heed at all. Now, we are seeking your kind measures to get rid of this crisis.\nI, therefore, pray and hope that you would be sympathetic enough to take effective steps to stop the antisocial activities and save us from the panic.\n\nSincerely yours.\nEmrul Chowdhury\nOn behalf of the people of Pabna"

          "explanation": "Road Accidents in Bangladesh\nRoad accidents in Bangladesh have become a grave concern over recent years, claiming numerous lives and causing severe injuries. The causes are multifaceted, ranging from poor road conditions, faulty vehicles, to human negligence. Overcrowded streets, coupled with a lack of proper traffic management, frequently result in chaos and collisions. Many drivers, especially of public transport, lack proper training and often drive recklessly to meet tight schedules or to get more passengers. Furthermore, pedestrians, sometimes without adequate infrastructure like zebra crossings or foot-over bridges, risk their lives while crossing roads.\nThe effects of these accidents are devastating. Besides the immediate loss of life and injuries, families often lose their primary breadwinners, pushing them into financial hardships. The injured, if they survive, might endure long-term disabilities, leading to lost livelihoods and an increased burden on families and the healthcare system. Additionally, the nation faces economic losses due to damaged vehicles and infrastructure, as well as reduced productivity from the injured or deceased.\nIn conclusion, road accidents in Bangladesh are a critical issue that requires immediate and comprehensive interventions. Addressing infrastructure, ensuring proper training for drivers, and raising public awareness can go a long way in reducing this menace."
