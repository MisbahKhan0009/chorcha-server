I am writing to you, on behalf of the students of Dhaka College, to propose the establishment of an English Language Club within the college premises.\nAs a second-year college student, I have observed a growing interest among my peers in improving their English language skills. However, we feel that our current academic curriculum may not adequately cater to the practical aspects of language learning, such as speaking and listening proficiency.\nThe proposed English Language Club would serve as a platform for students to enhance their English language abilities through various interactive activities, such as debates, discussions, public speaking sessions, and language games. Additionally, the club could organize workshops, seminars, and guest lectures by language experts to provide valuable insights and guidance.\nMoreover, the English Language Club would foster a sense of camaraderie among students with a shared interest in language learning, promoting cultural exchange and mutual support.\nWe believe that the establishment of an English Language Club would complement our academic endeavors and contribute to our personal and professional development. Therefore, we earnestly request your support and approval for this initiative.\nThank you for considering our proposal. We look forward to your positive response and guidance on how to proceed further with this endeavor.\nSincerely,\nMotin\n[Your Signature]"

          "explanation": "The Celebration of Pahela Boishakh\nPahela Boishakh is the first day of Bangla year. In fact, it is the day of welcoming the Bangla New Year. It is part and parcel of Bengali culture and tradition (ঐতিহ্য). So, the day is observed with traditional festivity (উল্লাস) across the country. People in villages celebrate this day as per their agelong customs. Special meals are arranged at home and Boishakhi Melas are held in different places. It is a day of great pleasure to the village people and children. City dwellers (নগরবাসী) also celebrate this day with delight. Girls and women put on yellow saris and boys put on pajamapanjabi. Some people eat watered-rice with onion, green chilli and hilsha fish. Shopkeepers in both towns and villages open new accounts books (হালখাতা) and offer sweets to their customers and this is the most impressive part of the celebration. Different cultural organizations offer different programmes. The celebration of Pahela Boishakh bears a great importance for us. It is passed by holding and enjoying festive programmes and functions. People living in Dhaka attend the Gano Sangeeter Ashor at Ramna Batamul in the morning. We reap great benefits from this kind of festival. It makes us stick to our traditional native culture. At the same time, it strengthens national unity making us forget the differences of religion, colour, race, etc. On this day, we get inspired to forget all the sorrows and failures (ব্যর্থতা) of the past year and to start a new life. with new vigour (বলিষ্ঠতা) and inspiration."

          "question": "",
          "explanation": "The indiscriminate cutting of trees is a pressing environmental issue with far-reaching consequences. One of the primary causes of large-scale deforestation is the demand for timber and land for agriculture. As populations grow and economies develop, there is increased pressure to clear forests for urbanization and industrial activities. Additionally, logging for commercial purposes and the expansion of infrastructure contribute significantly to deforestation.The environmental effects of indiscriminate tree cutting are severe. Forests play a crucial role in regulating the climate by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. Their destruction leads to increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, exacerbating global warming and climate change. Moreover, deforestation disrupts ecosystems, leading to loss of biodiversity as habitats are destroyed. This, in turn, threatens the survival of numerous plant and animal species, some of which may be unique to specific forest ecosystems.Furthermore, deforestation contributes to soil erosion and alters local rainfall patterns, impacting agricultural productivity and water availability. The loss of forests also reduces the natural protection against natural disasters like floods and landslides. In conclusion, addressing the issue of indiscriminate tree cutting is crucial for mitigating climate change, preserving biodiversity, and ensuring sustainable development for future generations."
