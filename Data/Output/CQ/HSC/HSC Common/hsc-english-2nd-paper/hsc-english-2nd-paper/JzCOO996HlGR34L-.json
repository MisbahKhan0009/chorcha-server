Dhaka is a densely populated city for which its streets tend to get crowded as well. But the traffic noise is getting out of control and affecting our quality of life. The sound of the engines and blaring of the horns can be heard without a rest. It interferes with our concentration, distupts sleep and leads to stress related issues. In the long run, continuous exposure to loud noises can also cause severe hearing loss. I, therefore, hope that you would kindly consider taking imperative steps to check unendurable noise in the streets of the city and oblige us thereby.\nYours faithfully,\nAbdul Fahad\nManda Union, Dhaka"

          "explanation": "Causes and Effects of Unemployment in Bangladesh\nUnemployment refers to the state of a person, capable of working, unable to find a paid job. In Bangladesh, unemployment still remains as one of the significant challenges. In order to address this issue hindering economic growth, the causes of unemployment need to be explored first. Rapid population growth is a major factor behind the unemployment rate. In comparison to the population, there are not enough job opportunities in the market. So, when a fresh graduate or anyone from the working-age enters the job market, the competition is quite fierce for a single seat. On the other hand, due to the digitalization of the country, laborers are being replaced with machines in the work field. Although automation helps businesses by improving its productivity and accuracy, it leaves a gap in the job market by reducing job opportunities. Lack of proper training and workoriented education are some of the other contributing factors regarding unemployment. The effect of unemployment falls directly on the economy of the country. Without a source of an income, unemployed people fail to provide themselves and their families with basic necessities. As a result, their standard of living meets no improvement. The pressure of finding a job and affording expenses collectively may cause extreme mental health issues for the people involved. It is a serious issue that the government cannot fix alone; we should all come forward to build a better nation by reducing unemployment in the country."
