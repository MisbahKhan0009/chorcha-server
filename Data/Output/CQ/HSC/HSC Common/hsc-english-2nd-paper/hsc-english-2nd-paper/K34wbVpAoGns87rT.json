In markets there is hardly any food item which is not adulterated. Fruits, vegetables, fishes, milk and milk products among others are severely adulterated in markets all over Bangladesh. A recent survey conducted in different areas of Dhaka City shows that about half of the 82 samples of fish, vegetables, milk and milk products have been found adulterated with DDT, Aldrin and other poisonous chemicals. There are some definite reasons behind food adulteration. For example , the people who are responsible to check adulteration are not serious in their duties. Besides, chemicals like formalin are easily available to dishonest people. And the most striking reason is greed along with lack of consciousness. Some dishonest people want to make unbridled profit through the unfair ways of food adulteration.\n(a) adulteration (synonym); (b) problems (antonym); (c) hardly (synonym); (d) severely (antonym); (e) recent (synonym); (f) conducted (synonym); (g) poisonous (antonym); (h) definite (antonym); (i) example (synonym); (j) responsible (antonym); (k) serious (synonym); (1) available (antonym); (m) greed (antonym); (n) unbridled (synonym).",

I am writing to you, on behalf of the students of Dhaka College, to propose the establishment of an English Language Club within the college premises.\nAs a second-year college student, I have observed a growing interest among my peers in improving their English language skills. However, we feel that our current academic curriculum may not adequately cater to the practical aspects of language learning, such as speaking and listening proficiency.\nThe proposed English Language Club would serve as a platform for students to enhance their English language abilities through various interactive activities, such as debates, discussions, public speaking sessions, and language games. Additionally, the club could organize workshops, seminars, and guest lectures by language experts to provide valuable insights and guidance.\nMoreover, the English Language Club would foster a sense of camaraderie among students with a shared interest in language learning, promoting cultural exchange and mutual support.\nWe believe that the establishment of an English Language Club would complement our academic endeavors and contribute to our personal and professional development. Therefore, we earnestly request your support and approval for this initiative.\nThank you for considering our proposal. We look forward to your positive response and guidance on how to proceed further with this endeavor.\nSincerely,\nMotin\n[Your Signature]"

          "explanation": "\nFemale education is not just a matter of providing schooling to girls; it is a fundamental right and a powerful tool for social and economic development. When girls are educated, they gain the knowledge, skills, and confidence to pursue their dreams and contribute meaningfully to society. One of the primary benefits of female education is its positive impact on health outcomes. Educated women are more likely to make informed decisions about their health and that of their families, leading to lower maternal and child mortality rates. Additionally, female education plays a crucial role in breaking the cycle of poverty. Educated women have better employment opportunities and higher earning potential, enabling them to support themselves and their families financially. Moreover, educating girls fosters gender equality by challenging traditional gender roles and stereotypes. It empowers women to participate actively in decision-making processes, both at home and in society, and promotes a more inclusive and equitable society overall. Furthermore, female education has far-reaching effects on community development, as educated women are more likely to invest in their children's education and contribute to the socioeconomic development of their communities. Therefore, investing in female education is not only a moral imperative but also a strategic investment in the future prosperity and well-being of nations.\n"

          "explanation": "Causes and Effects of Unemployment in Bangladesh\nUnemployment refers to the state of a person, capable of working, unable to find a paid job. In Bangladesh, unemployment still remains as one of the significant challenges. In order to address this issue hindering economic growth, the causes of unemployment need to be explored first. Rapid population growth is a major factor behind the unemployment rate. In comparison to the population, there are not enough job opportunities in the market. So, when a fresh graduate or anyone from the working-age enters the job market, the competition is quite fierce for a single seat. On the other hand, due to the digitalization of the country, laborers are being replaced with machines in the work field. Although automation helps businesses by improving its productivity and accuracy, it leaves a gap in the job market by reducing job opportunities. Lack of proper training and workoriented education are some of the other contributing factors regarding unemployment. The effect of unemployment falls directly on the economy of the country. Without a source of an income, unemployed people fail to provide themselves and their families with basic necessities. As a result, their standard of living meets no improvement. The pressure of finding a job and affording expenses collectively may cause extreme mental health issues for the people involved. It is a serious issue that the government cannot fix alone; we should all come forward to build a better nation by reducing unemployment in the country."
