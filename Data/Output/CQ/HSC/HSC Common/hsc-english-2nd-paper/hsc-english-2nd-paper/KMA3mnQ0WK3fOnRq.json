          "explanation": "Grameen Bank\nGrameen Bank is a revolutionary microfinance organization in Bangladesh that has transformed the lives of millions of poor people, especially rural women. Founded in 1983 by Nobel Laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus, the bank operates on a unique model of providing small loans, or microcredit, to the poor without requiring any collateral. The main goal of Grameen Bank is to empower the underprivileged, enabling them to start small businesses and improve their standard of living. Unlike traditional banks, it focuses on trust, group accountability, and community support. Over 90% of its borrowers are women, who have used the loans to engage in activities like weaving, poultry farming, and grocery trading. This financial independence has not only reduced poverty but also promoted gender equality in rural areas. The bank’s success has inspired similar microcredit programs across the globe. In 2006, both Grameen Bank and Professor Yunus were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to create economic and social development from below. Grameen Bank has proven that even the poorest of the poor can be creditworthy and that access to finance is a powerful tool for social change. It remains a symbol of hope, empowerment, and grassroots development."

          "question": "",
          "explanation": "Gender Discrimination\nGender discrimination is a serious social problem that affects individuals and societies across the world. It refers to the unequal treatment of people based on their gender, most often seen in the form of discrimination against women and girls. In many countries, especially in developing nations like Bangladesh, gender discrimination begins at birth. Girls are often considered a burden, denied equal access to education, nutrition, and healthcare. As they grow older, they face limited job opportunities, unequal pay, and lack of representation in leadership roles. Even within households, women are expected to take on unpaid domestic work, while their contributions go unrecognized. Men, on the other hand, are pressured to conform to traditional notions of masculinity, which also limits their freedom of expression. This imbalance creates a cycle of inequality and injustice. Gender discrimination not only hinders personal development but also slows national progress. A society cannot prosper by excluding half of its population from equal rights and opportunities. To combat this issue, awareness must be raised, and equal laws and policies must be implemented and enforced. True development is only possible when both men and women are treated equally in all spheres of life. Gender equality ensures justice, dignity, and growth for all."
