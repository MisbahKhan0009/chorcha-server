          "explanation": "Etiquette and Manners\n'Etiquette' and 'manners' are synonymous words. The word 'etiquette' is derived from French language. It means the rules of correct behaviour in society. On the other hand, 'manners' is an English word. It means the behaviour that is considered to be polite in a particular society or culture. In English there is a slight difference between the meanings of the words 'manner' and 'manners'. Manner refers to usual behaviour towards others. It may be good or bad. However, the word 'manners' is the plural form of the word 'manner'. It refers to polite ways of treating people. Speaking with food in one's mouth is socially considered a bad manner. A bad mannered person has less social acceptance. Everybody dislikes him. The idea of 'etiquette' and 'manners' is not same. It varies from culture to culture and society to society. The best institute of learning 'etiquette\" and 'manners' is the family. We learn it from our parents at our very early age. We also learn it in schools, colleges and from professional bodies. Every social occasion has its own rules of behaviour. They are different from each other. Some behaviour may appropriate in a wedding ceremony, but inappropriate in deering from So, we must be careful about 'etiquette' and 'manners\" as they represent the quality of individuals.\""

          "explanation": "Brain Drain\nThe term 'Brain drain' is a current concept in our country. It refers to the migration of highly qualified professionals to foreign countries. There are some obvious reasons for brain drain. The first and foremost reason is the lack of scope for higher education. As many brilliant students do not get good opportunities to receive higher education in our country, they are compelled to seek admission to foreign universities and colleges. As a result, they ultimately migrate to some foreign countries in order to receive higher education. Usually, some highly ambitious students who have sufficient financial support, migrate for higher education. After the completion of their higher education, they seek a good job and if they can manage one, they get settled there. They never think of returning home. This brain drain has a very negative impact on the socio-economic development of our country. Because of this, our country is deprived of the better services from many of her brilliant and talented people. In order to stop this brain drain, the authority should establish more universities to facilitate higher education. Apart from this, the students should be dutiful to their motherland and should not leave her for good."
