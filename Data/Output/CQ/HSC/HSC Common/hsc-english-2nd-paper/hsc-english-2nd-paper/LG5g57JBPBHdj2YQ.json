          "explanation": "Causes and Effects of Unemployment in Bangladesh\nUnemployment refers to the state of a person, capable of working, unable to find a paid job. In Bangladesh, unemployment still remains as one of the significant challenges. In order to address this issue hindering economic growth, the causes of unemployment need to be explored first. Rapid population growth is a major factor behind the unemployment rate. In comparison to the population, there are not enough job opportunities in the market. So, when a fresh graduate or anyone from the working-age enters the job market, the competition is quite fierce for a single seat. On the other hand, due to the digitalization of the country, laborers are being replaced with machines in the work field. Although automation helps businesses by improving its productivity and accuracy, it leaves a gap in the job market by reducing job opportunities. Lack of proper training and workoriented education are some of the other contributing factors regarding unemployment. The effect of unemployment falls directly on the economy of the country. Without a source of an income, unemployed people fail to provide themselves and their families with basic necessities. As a result, their standard of living meets no improvement. The pressure of finding a job and affording expenses collectively may cause extreme mental health issues for the people involved. It is a serious issue that the government cannot fix alone; we should all come forward to build a better nation by reducing unemployment in the country."

          "explanation": "The Celebration of Pahela Boishakh\nPahela Boishakh is the first day of Bangla year. In fact, it is the day of welcoming the Bangla New Year. It is part and parcel of Bengali culture and tradition (ঐতিহ্য). So, the day is observed with traditional festivity (উল্লাস) across the country. People in villages celebrate this day as per their agelong customs. Special meals are arranged at home and Boishakhi Melas are held in different places. It is a day of great pleasure to the village people and children. City dwellers (নগরবাসী) also celebrate this day with delight. Girls and women put on yellow saris and boys put on pajamapanjabi. Some people eat watered-rice with onion, green chilli and hilsha fish. Shopkeepers in both towns and villages open new accounts books (হালখাতা) and offer sweets to their customers and this is the most impressive part of the celebration. Different cultural organizations offer different programmes. The celebration of Pahela Boishakh bears a great importance for us. It is passed by holding and enjoying festive programmes and functions. People living in Dhaka attend the Gano Sangeeter Ashor at Ramna Batamul in the morning. We reap great benefits from this kind of festival. It makes us stick to our traditional native culture. At the same time, it strengthens national unity making us forget the differences of religion, colour, race, etc. On this day, we get inspired to forget all the sorrows and failures (ব্যর্থতা) of the past year and to start a new life. with new vigour (বলিষ্ঠতা) and inspiration."
