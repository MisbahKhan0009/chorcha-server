For many different reasons, English has achieved the prestige of being that language. As a result, it has crossed national borders to reach people who speak other languages. It is no longer the unique possession of British or American people, but a language that belongs to the world's people. In fact, bilingual and multilingual users of English far outnumber its monolingual native speakers. This phenomenon has led to a bewildering variety of English around the world. As more and more people speak English, more and more varieties have emerged which are strongly influenced by the pronunciation, grammar and idioms of the respective mother tongues. World English has now moved away from the control of the native speakers. However, the question of British or American English is not so important now.

This poses a serious health risk to all students, teachers, and staff members. It is essential for every individual to have access to clean and safe drinking water, especially in an educational environment.\nTherefore, I kindly request you to take the necessary steps to ensure that safe drinking water is available on the college campus. Installing water purifiers or providing bottled water would be an effective solution to this problem.\nI hope you will give this matter the attention it deserves and take prompt action.\nThank you for your understanding and consideration.\nYours faithfully,\n[Your Name]\nClass XII\nABC College"

          "explanation": "\nCity life and rural life present starkly contrasting lifestyles and environments. In cities, there is a fast-paced, bustling atmosphere characterized by a dense population, skyscrapers, and advanced infrastructure. People in urban areas have access to a wide array of amenities, including entertainment venues, educational institutions, healthcare facilities, and employment opportunities. However, city life can also be hectic, stressful, and impersonal, with a higher cost of living and increased pollution levels. On the other hand, rural life is characterized by its tranquility, close-knit communities, and proximity to nature. Residents of rural areas enjoy cleaner air, scenic landscapes, and a slower pace of life. There is a stronger sense of community and neighborly support in rural settings, along with lower living expenses. However, access to services and amenities may be limited, and employment opportunities can be scarce, leading to economic challenges. Overall, while city life offers convenience and excitement, rural life provides peace and a closer connection to nature. Both lifestyles have their unique advantages and drawbacks, appealing to different preferences and priorities.\n"

          "explanation": "Impact of Climate Change in Bangladesh\nLong-term variation in temperatures and weather patterns is known as climate change. The frequent\nshift of climate in Bangladesh has been showing a number of devastating effects, such as, rising sea level, floods and intensifying cyclones, Firstly, Rising sea level is a growing threat to people all around Bangladesh. To illustrate, Two-thirds of the land of this country is less than fifteen feet above sea level. So, the increase of sea level might cause extinction of huge low land area, Respondingly, The dwellers of the area may have to migrate from their own land. Secondly, Climate change is making rainfall more erratic and often far more intense. In terms of Bangladesh, this reality has recently become quite evident, Because of irregular rain and melting the Himalayan glaciers, Bangladesh is now far more vulnerable to devastating floods, Lastly and more importantly, The Bay of Bangal narrows towards its northern shore where it meets the south of coast Bangladesh. This narrowing can both direct cyclones towards Bangladesh's coast and make them more intense. To conclude, to minimize climate change, some immediate steps could be taken such as planting more trees, reducing the use of CFC gases, using electric vehicles, recycling plastic materials, In a word, People should practice eco-friendly behaviors to protect the nature as well as themselves.\n\n"
