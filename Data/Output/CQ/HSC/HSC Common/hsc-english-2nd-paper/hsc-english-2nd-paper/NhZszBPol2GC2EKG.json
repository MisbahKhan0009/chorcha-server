There are natural constraints to learning English in Bangladesh. Children who are born and brought up in this country hardly receive any input in English. English teachers at school or college do not usually speak proper English; in fact, they teach English with an accented Bangla. Despite receiving comparatively more inputs from the SDB (Standard Dialect of Bangla). very few can speak this dialect with a proper accent. If the authorities dream of making English the medium of instruction , the project will be dumped . As with most issues in Bangladesh, the question of language has never been handled with enough care and wisdom . Each year, during the month of February, a considerable amount of crocodile tears is shed for the Bangla language.

          "explanation": "The Causes and Effects of Drug Addiction on the Individual, Family and Overall Society\nDrug is an essential element of human life. But abuse of drugs affects the nervous system (স্নায়ুতন্ত্র) of our body seriously. Drug addiction means a strong desire for a drug which the addict cannot resist. Narcotics like opium, morphine, heroin, marijuana, cocaine, etc. are used by the addicts. These drugs are used for their intoxicating ( উন্মাদক), tranquillizing and stimulating effects. If a person gets addicted to any of these once, he cannot go without it. Drug addiction is a curse of modern civilization. Drugs make youngsters go astray and destroy many valuable and beautiful lives. There are some reasons for drug addiction such as, frustration, bad association, availability of intoxicant, unemployment, failure in love, degradation of religious values, lack of family ties, etc. When a young person falls into a completely hopeless situation, drugs allure him. Sometimes young boys and girls come in contact with drugs out of curiosity. Drug addiction creates social problems. Narcotics (মাদকদ্রব্য) are very expensive. So. the addicted person often goes for stealing, hijacking and all sorts of misdeeds to procure money for buying drugs. He can, in no circumstances, refrain from taking drugs. He tries to have it at any cost. It helps him to see strange things that have no existence at all to him. The drug addict also does something that ruins the peace of the family. He even steals ornaments, utensils, clothes and what not to procure money for buying drugs. So, all other members of the family remain in tension for his misdeeds. The fate of the addict is pathetic. He dies a painful death losing character: He becomes a burden not only for the family but also for the society and also for the nation. The remedy for drug addiction is not very easy. Drug addiction is not only a national but also a global problem. To save our young generation from drug addiction, the government and educated people should come forward with necessary remedies. Strong measures should be taken to stop the production and trafficking (পাচার) of drugs. Drug business is punishable (শাস্তিযোগ্য) and the highest punishment is death sentence in Bangladesh. This law should be enforced immediately."
