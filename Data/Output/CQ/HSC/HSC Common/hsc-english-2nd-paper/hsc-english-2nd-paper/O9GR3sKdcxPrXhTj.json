          "explanation": "Impact of Climate Change in Bangladesh\nLong-term variation in temperatures and weather patterns is known as climate change. The frequent\nshift of climate in Bangladesh has been showing a number of devastating effects, such as, rising sea level, floods and intensifying cyclones, Firstly, Rising sea level is a growing threat to people all around Bangladesh. To illustrate, Two-thirds of the land of this country is less than fifteen feet above sea level. So, the increase of sea level might cause extinction of huge low land area, Respondingly, The dwellers of the area may have to migrate from their own land. Secondly, Climate change is making rainfall more erratic and often far more intense. In terms of Bangladesh, this reality has recently become quite evident, Because of irregular rain and melting the Himalayan glaciers, Bangladesh is now far more vulnerable to devastating floods, Lastly and more importantly, The Bay of Bangal narrows towards its northern shore where it meets the south of coast Bangladesh. This narrowing can both direct cyclones towards Bangladesh's coast and make them more intense. To conclude, to minimize climate change, some immediate steps could be taken such as planting more trees, reducing the use of CFC gases, using electric vehicles, recycling plastic materials, In a word, People should practice eco-friendly behaviors to protect the nature as well as themselves.\n\n"
