In fact, bilingual and multilingual users of English far outnumber its monolingual native speakers. This phenomenon has led to a bewildering variety of English around the world. As more and more people speak English, more and more varieties have emerged which are strongly influenced by the pronunciation, grammar and idioms of the respective mother tongues.

As a student of [Your Course/Department] at X College, I am writing to bring to your attention a proposal that I believe will significantly enhance the learning experience for all students: the introduction of multimedia facilities in classrooms.\nIn today's digital age, traditional teaching methods are being complemented, and in many cases replaced, by interactive and multimedia-based learning techniques. The integration of multimedia resources such as projectors, smart boards, and audiovisual equipment can greatly enrich the educational experience by making lessons more engaging, interactive, and accessible to diverse learning styles.\nMultimedia facilities in classrooms would enable instructors to incorporate a variety of teaching aids such as educational videos, interactive presentations, and digital simulations into their lectures. This would not only capture the attention of students but also facilitate better understanding and retention of complex concepts.\nMoreover, multimedia facilities can accommodate different learning preferences and cater to the needs of students with varying abilities, ensuring a more inclusive learning environment. Additionally, the use of multimedia technology fosters creativity and critical thinking skills among students by encouraging them to explore, analyze, and synthesize information in innovative ways.\nI believe that the introduction of multimedia facilities in classrooms aligns with X College's commitment to providing quality education and preparing students for success in a rapidly evolving world. Therefore, I urge you to consider this proposal favorably and take the necessary steps to implement multimedia facilities in our college classrooms.\nThank you for considering my suggestion. I am confident that this initiative will greatly benefit the academic community at X College and contribute to the overall enhancement of our educational experience.\nYours sincerely,\n[Your Name] [Your Course/Department] [Your Roll/ID Number]"

          "explanation": "The Causes and Effects of Drug Addiction on the Individual, Family and Overall Society\nDrug is an essential element of human life. But abuse of drugs affects the nervous system (স্নায়ুতন্ত্র) of our body seriously. Drug addiction means a strong desire for a drug which the addict cannot resist. Narcotics like opium, morphine, heroin, marijuana, cocaine, etc. are used by the addicts. These drugs are used for their intoxicating ( উন্মাদক), tranquillizing and stimulating effects. If a person gets addicted to any of these once, he cannot go without it. Drug addiction is a curse of modern civilization. Drugs make youngsters go astray and destroy many valuable and beautiful lives. There are some reasons for drug addiction such as, frustration, bad association, availability of intoxicant, unemployment, failure in love, degradation of religious values, lack of family ties, etc. When a young person falls into a completely hopeless situation, drugs allure him. Sometimes young boys and girls come in contact with drugs out of curiosity. Drug addiction creates social problems. Narcotics (মাদকদ্রব্য) are very expensive. So. the addicted person often goes for stealing, hijacking and all sorts of misdeeds to procure money for buying drugs. He can, in no circumstances, refrain from taking drugs. He tries to have it at any cost. It helps him to see strange things that have no existence at all to him. The drug addict also does something that ruins the peace of the family. He even steals ornaments, utensils, clothes and what not to procure money for buying drugs. So, all other members of the family remain in tension for his misdeeds. The fate of the addict is pathetic. He dies a painful death losing character: He becomes a burden not only for the family but also for the society and also for the nation. The remedy for drug addiction is not very easy. Drug addiction is not only a national but also a global problem. To save our young generation from drug addiction, the government and educated people should come forward with necessary remedies. Strong measures should be taken to stop the production and trafficking (পাচার) of drugs. Drug business is punishable (শাস্তিযোগ্য) and the highest punishment is death sentence in Bangladesh. This law should be enforced immediately."

          "explanation": "Impact of Climate Change in Bangladesh\nLong-term variation in temperatures and weather patterns is known as climate change. The frequent\nshift of climate in Bangladesh has been showing a number of devastating effects, such as, rising sea level, floods and intensifying cyclones, Firstly, Rising sea level is a growing threat to people all around Bangladesh. To illustrate, Two-thirds of the land of this country is less than fifteen feet above sea level. So, the increase of sea level might cause extinction of huge low land area, Respondingly, The dwellers of the area may have to migrate from their own land. Secondly, Climate change is making rainfall more erratic and often far more intense. In terms of Bangladesh, this reality has recently become quite evident, Because of irregular rain and melting the Himalayan glaciers, Bangladesh is now far more vulnerable to devastating floods, Lastly and more importantly, The Bay of Bangal narrows towards its northern shore where it meets the south of coast Bangladesh. This narrowing can both direct cyclones towards Bangladesh's coast and make them more intense. To conclude, to minimize climate change, some immediate steps could be taken such as planting more trees, reducing the use of CFC gases, using electric vehicles, recycling plastic materials, In a word, People should practice eco-friendly behaviors to protect the nature as well as themselves.\n\n"
