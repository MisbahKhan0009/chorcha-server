It takes time for a euphemism to embed into common knowledge, so creating a euphemism from scratch is challenging . For example, there are a number of origin stories for the euphemism bought the farm, which means that someone has died often in a plane crash or collision . Some reports suggest the phrase comes from Air Force officers saying that when they retire , they're going to settle down and buy a farm. Thus, if that officer dies in a crash, it's said, darkly, that they bought the farm. An alternative story is that when Air Force planes crashed in rural areas, the farmers whose land they hit would sue the government for damages and use that money to pay off their mortgage. That plane crash, then, indirectly bought the farm for the farmer. There are a number, of other origins suggested for the phrase, but all of that is to say, euphemisms rely on a common understanding of the phrase itself, not its literal meaning. Euphemisms are among many phrases in the English language that rely on local or cultural understanding. Similar figures of speech are slang, colloquialisms, vernacular, and idioms.\n(a) Origin (antonym); (b) challenging (synonym); (c) collision (synonym); (d) suggest (synonym); (e) retire (antonym); (f) alternative (antonym); (g) rural (synonym); (h) damages (synonym); (i) indirectly (synonym); (j) rely (antonym); (k) understanding (synonym); (l) literal (antonym); (m) local (antonym); (n) similar (synonym).",

Despite laws against these practices, they are still happening due to lack of strict action and awareness. Many poor families marry off their young daughters because of financial problems. In some cases, people force brides' families to give dowry, causing great suffering. Unfortunately, the measures to stop these illegal acts are not strong enough, and many cases go unreported.\nWe, therefore, hope that you will take necessary steps to stop child marriage and dowry, protect young girls, and ensure a safer future for them.\nTruly yours,\nRehnuma Hossain Tinni\nJoypurhat"

          "question": "",
          "explanation": "Bribery\nBribery is a serious problem in Bangladesh. It happens when people give money or gifts illegally to get special favours. There are many reasons for bribery. One major cause is poverty. Many government employees receive low salaries, so some take bribes to earn extra money. Corruption is another big reason. When officials do not fear punishment, they continue to take bribes. Lack of strict laws and proper action also makes bribery worse. Many people do not get fair services unless they pay extra money, which forces them to give bribes. Bribery has many bad effects on society. It destroys fairness and justice. Poor people cannot get their rights because they cannot afford bribes. It also slows down development. When people get jobs or contracts by bribery instead of merit, the country suffers. Bribery also reduces people's trust in the government and law. To stop bribery, we need strict laws and honest officers. People should also raise their voices against corruption. If we fight bribery together, Bangladesh can become a fair and just country."

          "explanation": "A Stranger\nA stranger is someone we do not know. We see strangers in many places, like roads, markets, or buses. There are different reasons why someone may be a stranger to us. One reason is travelling. When people visit a new place, they do not know anyone there, so they become strangers. Another reason is moving to a new area. When families shift to a different city or village, they take time to know their neighbours. Sometimes, a stranger can be someone lost or in trouble, asking for directions or help. Meeting strangers can have different effects. Some strangers are kind and helpful. They give directions or offer help when needed. But some strangers may be dangerous. They may try to cheat or harm people. This is why, we must be careful while talking to strangers. Children should never trust strangers easily and always inform parents if a stranger talks to them. Strangers can become friends if we know them well. But we must always stay alert and cautious while dealing with unknown people."
