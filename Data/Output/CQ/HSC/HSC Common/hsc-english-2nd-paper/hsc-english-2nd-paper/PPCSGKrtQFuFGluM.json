I am writing to you, on behalf of the students of Dhaka College, to propose the establishment of an English Language Club within the college premises.\nAs a second-year college student, I have observed a growing interest among my peers in improving their English language skills. However, we feel that our current academic curriculum may not adequately cater to the practical aspects of language learning, such as speaking and listening proficiency.\nThe proposed English Language Club would serve as a platform for students to enhance their English language abilities through various interactive activities, such as debates, discussions, public speaking sessions, and language games. Additionally, the club could organize workshops, seminars, and guest lectures by language experts to provide valuable insights and guidance.\nMoreover, the English Language Club would foster a sense of camaraderie among students with a shared interest in language learning, promoting cultural exchange and mutual support.\nWe believe that the establishment of an English Language Club would complement our academic endeavors and contribute to our personal and professional development. Therefore, we earnestly request your support and approval for this initiative.\nThank you for considering our proposal. We look forward to your positive response and guidance on how to proceed further with this endeavor.\nSincerely,\nMotin\n[Your Signature]"

          "explanation": "Impact of Climate Change in Bangladesh\nLong-term variation in temperatures and weather patterns is known as climate change. The frequent\nshift of climate in Bangladesh has been showing a number of devastating effects, such as, rising sea level, floods and intensifying cyclones, Firstly, Rising sea level is a growing threat to people all around Bangladesh. To illustrate, Two-thirds of the land of this country is less than fifteen feet above sea level. So, the increase of sea level might cause extinction of huge low land area, Respondingly, The dwellers of the area may have to migrate from their own land. Secondly, Climate change is making rainfall more erratic and often far more intense. In terms of Bangladesh, this reality has recently become quite evident, Because of irregular rain and melting the Himalayan glaciers, Bangladesh is now far more vulnerable to devastating floods, Lastly and more importantly, The Bay of Bangal narrows towards its northern shore where it meets the south of coast Bangladesh. This narrowing can both direct cyclones towards Bangladesh's coast and make them more intense. To conclude, to minimize climate change, some immediate steps could be taken such as planting more trees, reducing the use of CFC gases, using electric vehicles, recycling plastic materials, In a word, People should practice eco-friendly behaviors to protect the nature as well as themselves.\n\n"

          "explanation": "The Historic Speech of 7 th 7^{\\text {th }} 7 th March\nThe historic 7 th 7^{\\text {th }} 7 th March Speech of Bangabandhu is a speech delivered by the founding father of Bangladesh- Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, at the then Ramna Racecourse ground (now Suhrawardy Udyan) in Dhaka to a gathering of over twenty thousand people on 7 March 1971. It was the core inspiration of our liberation war During the speech, Bangabandhu declared in a thunderous voice that \"The struggle, this time, is for our freedom; the fight, this time, is for our independence.\" It was delivered during a period of escalating tensions between East (now Bangladesh) and West Pakistan. Pakistani military rulers refused to transfer the power to Bangabandhu, whose party Awami League gained the majority by winning 167 of the 169 seats allotted to East Pakistan and a majority of the 313 seats in the National Assembly in the general election of 1970. The Bangalees were already in destitute due to the economic favoritism practiced by the West Pakistani rulers for 23 years. The speech inspired them to prepare for a war of independence amid widespread reports of armed mobilisation by West Pakistan. The Bangladesh Liberation War began 18 days later, when the Pakistan Army launched Operation Searchlight against Bengali civilians, intellectuals, students and politicians. On 30 October 2017, UNESCO has recognized the speech as a part of world's documentary heritage."
