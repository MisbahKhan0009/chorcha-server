Does beauty have an independent objective identity? Is it universal , or is it dependent on our sense perceptions ? Does it lie in the eye of the beholder ?- we ask ourselves. A further difficulty arises when beauty manifests itself not only by its presence, but by its absence as well, as when we are repulsed by ugliness and desire beauty. But then ugliness has as much a place in our lives as beauty, or may be more as when there is widespread hunger and injustice in a society.

          "explanation": "The Impact of Facebook on the Young Generation\nIn the digital age, social media platforms have become an integral part of the daily lives of millions worldwide. Among these, Facebook stands out as one of the most prominent and influential platforms, especially among the young generation. However, the impact of Facebook on today's youth is a subject of ongoing debate, with both positive and negative effects being observed.\nPositive Influence:\nFacebook has undoubtedly revolutionized the way young people communicate, connect, and share information. It serves as a virtual social hub, enabling users to stay connected with friends and family, regardless of geographical distances. Through Facebook, young individuals can maintain relationships, share updates about their lives, and express themselves creatively through photos, videos, and posts.\nMoreover, Facebook facilitates networking and provides opportunities for socialization. Many young people use Facebook to join groups and communities based on shared interests, hobbies, or causes. These online communities offer a sense of belonging and camaraderie, fostering friendships and collaborations that transcend physical boundaries.\nAdditionally, Facebook has emerged as a powerful platform for learning and awareness. It provides access to a vast repository of information, news, and educational resources. Young users can engage with informative content, participate in discussions, and broaden their perspectives on various issues.\nNegative Influence:\nDespite its many benefits, Facebook also exerts several negative influences on the young generation. One of the primary concerns is the impact on mental health. Excessive use of Facebook has been linked to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety among young users. The constant exposure to curated versions of others' lives on social media can lead to unrealistic comparisons and feelings of inadequacy.\nFurthermore, Facebook can be a breeding ground for cyberbullying and online harassment. Young people may face peer pressure, criticism, or harassment from their peers, which can have detrimental effects on their self-esteem and well-being.\nAnother significant issue associated with Facebook is its potential for addiction. The platform's addictive features, such as likes, comments, and notifications, can lead to compulsive usage patterns, detracting from real-world interactions and productivity.\nMoreover, concerns have been raised about the impact of Facebook on privacy and data security. Young users may unknowingly expose personal information or fall victim to online scams and phishing attacks, posing risks to their safety and security.\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, Facebook wields a profound influence on the young generation, shaping their social interactions, behaviors, and perceptions. While it offers numerous benefits in terms of connectivity, information sharing, and community building, it also poses challenges related to mental health, privacy, and online safety. Therefore, it is imperative for young users, parents, educators, and policymakers to recognize the dual nature of Facebook's impact and work towards promoting responsible and mindful usage of social media platforms."

Rural areas are adorned with natural beauty while urban areas are adorned only with numerous highrise attractive buildings. City life being furnished (সজ্জিত) with modern facilities, city-dwellers can enjoy better life. Here people get better medical facilities; better education, good sanitation, advanced communication and transport system, better recreation and most importantly better opportunities for employment, and making money through business and trade. On the contrary, rural people are deprived (বঞ্চিত) of good medical facilities, better scopes of getting good education, enjoying rapid and comfortable (আরামদায়ক) travelling or movement, running business and trade. Because here there are no good educational instructions, good hospitals with highly skilled and experienced doctors good road networks. On the other hand, cities are the hub (চক্রকেন্দ্র) of business and cotmmercial activities. Here, there is a great number of mills and factories, offices, shopping malls, supermarkets, etc. Consequently (অতএব), huge number of people get employment facilities. Urban people can pass pleasant time in zoo, parks, museums (জাদুঘর), theatres, cinema halls, clubs and some other attractive places. Contrarily, rural people bereft of these things, spend their time gossiping, playing or watching. TV. But city life is full of hustle and bustle (তাড়াহুড়া ও ছুটছুটি) and afflicted (পীড়িত) with pollution. Here people become sick due to various types of pollution. They cannot have pure and fresh foods. On the contrary, rural life being free of hustle and bustle and mechanical business, people here live a peaceful life. Rural people being simple and easy-going, they live in peace and amity with others. But their peaceful life often becomes disturbed owing to village politics. However, city life surpasses (অতিক্রম করা) rural life by virtue of various advantages. So, it is always attractive and appealing (আবেদনময়)."
