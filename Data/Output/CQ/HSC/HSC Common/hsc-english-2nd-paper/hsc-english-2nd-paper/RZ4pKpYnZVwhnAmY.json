They often taunt and tease college going youths especially the girls, hijack various vehicles, cheat the shopkeepers, give no fare to the rickshaw pullers, and behave roughly towards people and passers-by (পথচারী). Things turn worse after the sunset. They gather at the intersections (মোড়) of roads and footpaths to take narcotics such as hashish, phenyl, soporific drugs, and heroin. They sell various unauthorized things like forbidden drugs, illegal weapons, etc. here and there. Then they prey on passers-by and snatch away their belongings. Some people have been stabbed (ছুরিকাঘাত) and some others have been compelled to give them extortions. They have even threatened some persons with killing. So, we are all living in a frustrating (হতাশায়) situation with a premonition (পূর্বজ্ঞান) that conditions may deteriorate further.\nCommunity leaders and elderly citizens have tried to persuade them to come back to sense and stop bullying (গুন্ডামি) people. But they pay no heed at all. Now, we are seeking your kind measures to get rid of this crisis.\nI, therefore, pray and hope that you would be sympathetic enough to take effective steps to stop the antisocial activities and save us from the panic.\n\nSincerely yours.\nEmrul Chowdhury\nOn behalf of the people of Pabna"

          "explanation": "Causes and Effects of Unemployment in Bangladesh\nUnemployment refers to the state of a person, capable of working, unable to find a paid job. In Bangladesh, unemployment still remains as one of the significant challenges. In order to address this issue hindering economic growth, the causes of unemployment need to be explored first. Rapid population growth is a major factor behind the unemployment rate. In comparison to the population, there are not enough job opportunities in the market. So, when a fresh graduate or anyone from the working-age enters the job market, the competition is quite fierce for a single seat. On the other hand, due to the digitalization of the country, laborers are being replaced with machines in the work field. Although automation helps businesses by improving its productivity and accuracy, it leaves a gap in the job market by reducing job opportunities. Lack of proper training and workoriented education are some of the other contributing factors regarding unemployment. The effect of unemployment falls directly on the economy of the country. Without a source of an income, unemployed people fail to provide themselves and their families with basic necessities. As a result, their standard of living meets no improvement. The pressure of finding a job and affording expenses collectively may cause extreme mental health issues for the people involved. It is a serious issue that the government cannot fix alone; we should all come forward to build a better nation by reducing unemployment in the country."
