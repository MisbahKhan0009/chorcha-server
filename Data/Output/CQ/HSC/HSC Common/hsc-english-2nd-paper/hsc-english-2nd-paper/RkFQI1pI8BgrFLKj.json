I am writing to you, on behalf of the students of Dhaka College, to propose the establishment of an English Language Club within the college premises.\nAs a second-year college student, I have observed a growing interest among my peers in improving their English language skills. However, we feel that our current academic curriculum may not adequately cater to the practical aspects of language learning, such as speaking and listening proficiency.\nThe proposed English Language Club would serve as a platform for students to enhance their English language abilities through various interactive activities, such as debates, discussions, public speaking sessions, and language games. Additionally, the club could organize workshops, seminars, and guest lectures by language experts to provide valuable insights and guidance.\nMoreover, the English Language Club would foster a sense of camaraderie among students with a shared interest in language learning, promoting cultural exchange and mutual support.\nWe believe that the establishment of an English Language Club would complement our academic endeavors and contribute to our personal and professional development. Therefore, we earnestly request your support and approval for this initiative.\nThank you for considering our proposal. We look forward to your positive response and guidance on how to proceed further with this endeavor.\nSincerely,\nMotin\n[Your Signature]"

          "explanation": "My Visit to a Place of Historical Interest\n\nA historical place means a place which bears the testimony of history. It surely has some important past events worth notable in history. A visit to a historical place is not only interesting and exiting but also educative. It is my spontaneous habit to visit the historical places of our country whenever I get time and chance because it gives me much pleasure.\n\n\nLast winter, I visited Bagerhat, a historical place. The place is famous for the Shat Gombuj Mosque and the Mazar of Khan Jahan Ali. I along with my two friends started our journey on the fixed day, and reached the destination after an eight hours journey. When we reached there it was night. So we spent the night at a residential hotel in Bagerhat. Next morning we went out to visit the Shat Gombuj Mosque and the Majar of Khan Jahan Ali. It is three miles away from Bagerhat and we reached there by rickshaw. We were surprised to see the architectural structures of the mosque. It stands on sixty pillars and has seventy seven exquisitely curved domes.\n\n\nThe area of mosque is very large and charming. There is a long tank near the mosque named ‘Ghoradighi’. The mosque has been declared as a world heritage site. In fact, this mosque is one of the greatest tourist attractions of Bangladesh. We came to know that this mosque was used not only as a prayer hall but also as a court of justice. We also felt ecstasy to see the unique design of the Mazar of Khan Jahan Ali. It stands on a raised ground. The tomb is made of cutting stone. There is a big tank in front of the mazar. There are some crocodiles in this big tank. When the caretaker called them, they came near. It was a wonderful experience. Then we visited many social works of Khan Jahan Ali such as roads, public buildings etc.\n\n\nIt was a great pleasure for me to be at Bagerhat. It was indeed a rewarding visit. The sweet memory of this visit will remain ever fresh in my mind.\n"

          "explanation": "Impact of Climate Change in Bangladesh\nLong-term variation in temperatures and weather patterns is known as climate change. The frequent\nshift of climate in Bangladesh has been showing a number of devastating effects, such as, rising sea level, floods and intensifying cyclones, Firstly, Rising sea level is a growing threat to people all around Bangladesh. To illustrate, Two-thirds of the land of this country is less than fifteen feet above sea level. So, the increase of sea level might cause extinction of huge low land area, Respondingly, The dwellers of the area may have to migrate from their own land. Secondly, Climate change is making rainfall more erratic and often far more intense. In terms of Bangladesh, this reality has recently become quite evident, Because of irregular rain and melting the Himalayan glaciers, Bangladesh is now far more vulnerable to devastating floods, Lastly and more importantly, The Bay of Bangal narrows towards its northern shore where it meets the south of coast Bangladesh. This narrowing can both direct cyclones towards Bangladesh's coast and make them more intense. To conclude, to minimize climate change, some immediate steps could be taken such as planting more trees, reducing the use of CFC gases, using electric vehicles, recycling plastic materials, In a word, People should practice eco-friendly behaviors to protect the nature as well as themselves.\n\n"
