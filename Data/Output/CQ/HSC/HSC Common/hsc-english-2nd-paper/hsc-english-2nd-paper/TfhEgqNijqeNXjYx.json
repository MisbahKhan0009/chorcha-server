As a student of [Your Course/Department] at X College, I am writing to bring to your attention a proposal that I believe will significantly enhance the learning experience for all students: the introduction of multimedia facilities in classrooms.\nIn today's digital age, traditional teaching methods are being complemented, and in many cases replaced, by interactive and multimedia-based learning techniques. The integration of multimedia resources such as projectors, smart boards, and audiovisual equipment can greatly enrich the educational experience by making lessons more engaging, interactive, and accessible to diverse learning styles.\nMultimedia facilities in classrooms would enable instructors to incorporate a variety of teaching aids such as educational videos, interactive presentations, and digital simulations into their lectures. This would not only capture the attention of students but also facilitate better understanding and retention of complex concepts.\nMoreover, multimedia facilities can accommodate different learning preferences and cater to the needs of students with varying abilities, ensuring a more inclusive learning environment. Additionally, the use of multimedia technology fosters creativity and critical thinking skills among students by encouraging them to explore, analyze, and synthesize information in innovative ways.\nI believe that the introduction of multimedia facilities in classrooms aligns with X College's commitment to providing quality education and preparing students for success in a rapidly evolving world. Therefore, I urge you to consider this proposal favorably and take the necessary steps to implement multimedia facilities in our college classrooms.\nThank you for considering my suggestion. I am confident that this initiative will greatly benefit the academic community at X College and contribute to the overall enhancement of our educational experience.\nYours sincerely,\n[Your Name] [Your Course/Department] [Your Roll/ID Number]"

          "explanation": "Causes and Effects of Unemployment in Bangladesh\nUnemployment refers to the state of a person, capable of working, unable to find a paid job. In Bangladesh, unemployment still remains as one of the significant challenges. In order to address this issue hindering economic growth, the causes of unemployment need to be explored first. Rapid population growth is a major factor behind the unemployment rate. In comparison to the population, there are not enough job opportunities in the market. So, when a fresh graduate or anyone from the working-age enters the job market, the competition is quite fierce for a single seat. On the other hand, due to the digitalization of the country, laborers are being replaced with machines in the work field. Although automation helps businesses by improving its productivity and accuracy, it leaves a gap in the job market by reducing job opportunities. Lack of proper training and workoriented education are some of the other contributing factors regarding unemployment. The effect of unemployment falls directly on the economy of the country. Without a source of an income, unemployed people fail to provide themselves and their families with basic necessities. As a result, their standard of living meets no improvement. The pressure of finding a job and affording expenses collectively may cause extreme mental health issues for the people involved. It is a serious issue that the government cannot fix alone; we should all come forward to build a better nation by reducing unemployment in the country."

          "explanation": "Rohingya Repatriation\n\nRefugee crisis (শরণার্থী সংকট) is now a matter of great concern in Bangladesh. This crisis is not a new one in Bangladesh, rather it has been going on since long past. In fact, since the 1970s Rohingya refugees have been coming to Bangladesh from Myanmar. In the 1990 s 1990 \\mathrm{s} 1990 s , more than 2.50,000 resided in refugee camps in Bangladesh. In the early 2000 s, all but 20,000 of them were repatriated to Myanmar, some against 'their will. But unfortunately this respite (বিরাম) ended' in 2015 and by 2017, an estimated 3,00,000 to 5,00,000 Rohingya refugees were in Bangladesh: Most of the refugees are located along the Teknaf-Cox's Bazar Highway that is parallel to the Naf River marking the border between Bangladesh and Myanmar. Later on, the number of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh continues to increase because of the brutal (বর্বর) behaviour of the Myanmar Army towards them. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), more than 7,23,000 Rohingyas have fled to Bangladesh since 25 August 2017. But on 28 September 2018, at the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, Bangladesh Prime Minister Shelkh Hasina said, \"There are 1.1 million Rohingya refugees now in Bangladesh.\" This huge number of refugees is rare in any country of the world except Bangladesh. So, undoubtedly the refugee crisis has turned into a great crisis and at the same time, it informs the world people of the fact that Bangladesh, being a small country with a dense population, will not be able to feed a huge influx of Rohingya refugees in the days to come. At this moment, Bangladesh demands a permanent solution so that a huge number of Rohingya people can go back to their native country, that is the only way of Bangladesh to get rid of refugee crisis. In this regard, Bangladesh has to strengthen her diplomatic activities involving, especially, the UN and her powerful neighbouring countries.\n"
