          "explanation": "A Winter Morning\nA winter morning is usually cold, misty, and quiet. The sun rises late, and a dense fog often covers the surroundings, making it hard to see far. People, especially the poor, shiver in the cold, wrapping themselves in old blankets or warm clothes. The trees stand still, covered in dew, and everything appears calm and sleepy. Farmers and laborers light fires on the roadside to warm themselves. Children often hesitate to leave their cozy beds, and schools start a bit later than usual. The beauty of a winter morning is enhanced by the golden sunlight that gradually pierces through the fog, making everything glisten. Breakfasts are special during this time, with hot rice cakes (pithas), date juice, and fresh molasses being enjoyed by many. Despite the discomfort, a winter morning has its own charm and quiet beauty that brings a sense of peace and simplicity to life."

          "explanation": "The Causes and Effects of Social Media on Mental Health\nSocial media has become an inseparable part of modern life, but its impact on mental health is increasingly concerning. One major cause is excessive use, where individuals spend hours scrolling, often late into the night, disrupting sleep patterns. Comparison culture is another key factor—users frequently compare their lives with others' highlight reels, leading to feelings of inadequacy, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Cyberbullying and online harassment also contribute significantly, particularly among teenagers, causing emotional distress, depression, and social withdrawal. Additionally, the constant need for validation, such as likes and comments, makes self-worth dependent on virtual feedback, creating a cycle of anxiety and compulsive checking. The effects are profound: prolonged exposure can lead to isolation, reduced attention span, and addiction-like behaviors. Some individuals may even develop symptoms of depression, chronic loneliness, or social anxiety disorder. However, social media is not entirely negative—it can promote awareness, connection, and support when used mindfully. The key lies in moderation, digital literacy, and mental health awareness. Setting healthy boundaries and prioritizing real-life relationships can help individuals reclaim balance and protect their mental well-being in a digitally driven world."
