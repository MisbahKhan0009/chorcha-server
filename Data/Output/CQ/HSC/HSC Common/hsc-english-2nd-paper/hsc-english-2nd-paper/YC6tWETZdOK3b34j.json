They often taunt and tease college going youths especially the girls, hijack various vehicles, cheat the shopkeepers, give no fare to the rickshaw pullers and behave roughly towards people and passers-by (পথচারী). Things turn worse after the sunset. They gather at the intersections (মোড়) of roads and footpaths to take narcotics such as hashish, phensidyl , soporific drugs and heroin. They sell various unauthorized things like forbidden drugs, illegal weapons, etc. here and there. Then they prey on passers-by and snatch away their belongings. Some people have been stabbed (ছুরি আঘাত) and some others have been compelled to give them extortions. They have even threatened some persons with killing. So, we are' all living in a frustrating (হতাশাগ্রস্থ) situation with a premonition (পূর্বজ্ঞান) that conditions may deteriorate further.\nCommunity leaders and elderly citizens have tried to persuade them to come back to sense and stop bullying (গুন্ডামি) people. But they pay no heed at all. Now, we are seeking your kind measures to get rid of this crisis.\nI, therefore, pray and hope that you would be sympathetic enough to take effective steps to stop the antisocial activities and save us from the panic.\nSincerely yours, Emrul Chowdhury\nOn behalf of the people of Pabna"

          "explanation": "The Padma Multi-purpose Bridge\nThe Padma Multi-purpose Bridge is the longest and most expensive (ব্যায়বহুল) construction across the mighty River Padma. It has connected the capital with 21 southern districts of Bangladesh. It is 6.15 kilometres long and 18.18 metres wide. It has 41 spans on 42 pillars. The cost of the mega project is Tk. 30,193.39 crore. This mega project is being funded from the own resources of the government of Bangladesh. It is a truss bridge and the material of the bridge is steel. The bridge has increased connectivity beyond the boundary. It has established direct road communication between Dhaka and the southern parts of the country. It has opened up huge possibilities in the tourism (পর্যটন) sectors in Bangladesh. Traders can take their goods directly to the capital. They can make profit by supplying their fresh products to the buyers. The bridge has cut the travel time between Dhaka and Mongla Port. It will reduce overall poverty and contribute to industrial development, regional trade, agricultural expansion, etc. Soon after its inauguration of the Padma Bridge by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on 25 June 2022.15,200 vehicles cross it in the first 8 hours. A total of 24000 vehicles cross the Padma Bridge every day. The bridge has ensured the increase of GDP growth rate by more than 1%. Due to poor connectivity economic operation in the south-western zone has not been too easy. Consequently (অতএব), the districts did not seize much industrialization (শিল্পায়ন). As a result, poverty and unemployment constitute major problem in this region. However, the Padma Bridge will offer many advantages to the region. It will unveil the door of opportunity for industrialization which will remove unemployment problem."

          "explanation": "City life and village life offer contrasting experiences in terms of lifestyle, environment, and opportunities.\nIn cities, the pace of life is fast and dynamic. Urban areas are bustling with activity, offering numerous job opportunities, modern infrastructure, and advanced healthcare and education facilities. However, city life often comes with noise, pollution, and overcrowding, leading to a stressful and sometimes isolating experience. The conveniences of modern living, such as shopping malls, entertainment options, and transportation, are easily accessible but come at the cost of high living expenses.\nIn contrast, village life is generally slower and more peaceful. Villages are characterized by green landscapes, clean air, and a close-knit community. People in villages often enjoy a simpler life, with strong social ties and a sense of belonging. However, opportunities for work, education, and healthcare can be limited, and modern amenities might be scarce. People in rural areas tend to rely more on agriculture and manual work for their livelihood.\nWhile city life provides more material comforts and opportunities, village life offers tranquility and a deeper connection with nature. Ultimately, the choice between city and village life depends on individual preferences for convenience versus serenity."
