After the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948. Darwish witnessed massacres that forced his family to escape to Lebanon. A year later their clandestine return to their homeland put them in limbo, as they were declared \"present-absent aliens.\" Darwish left El-Birwa a second time in 1970 and traveled to the Soviet Union to complete his education in Moscow. He lived in Cairo, Beirut, London, and Paris, as well as Tunis, Tunisia, before returning in 1996 to live in Palestine, in the West Bank town of Ramallah. He was a member of the executive committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and wrote the declaration of independence issued by the Palestine National Council in 1988, but he resigned from the PLO in 1993 to protest the signing of the Oslo Accords by PLO chairman Yasser Arafat. In 2000 the Israeli education minister made plans to include Darwish's poems of reconciliation in the school curriculum, but Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak vetoed the plan. Darwish was impressed by the Iraqi poets Abd al-Wahhab Al-Bayati and Badr Shakir al-Sayyaab. He cited Arthur Rimbhaud and Allen Ginsberg as literary influences. Darwish admired the Hebrew poet Yehuda Amichai, but described his poetry as a \"challenge to me, because we write about the same place. He wants to use the landscape and history for his own benefit based on my destroyed identity.\n(a) struggles (synonym); (b) establishment (antonym); (c) massacres (synonym); (d) escape (synonym); (e) declared (synonym); (f) complete (synonym); (g) independence (antonym); (h) include (antonym); (i) impress (synonym); (j) cite (synonym); (k) admired (antonym); (l) describe (synonym); (m) benefit (synonym); (n) destroy (antonym).",

As a student of [Your Course/Department] at X College, I am writing to bring to your attention a proposal that I believe will significantly enhance the learning experience for all students: the introduction of multimedia facilities in classrooms.\nIn today's digital age, traditional teaching methods are being complemented, and in many cases replaced, by interactive and multimedia-based learning techniques. The integration of multimedia resources such as projectors, smart boards, and audiovisual equipment can greatly enrich the educational experience by making lessons more engaging, interactive, and accessible to diverse learning styles.\nMultimedia facilities in classrooms would enable instructors to incorporate a variety of teaching aids such as educational videos, interactive presentations, and digital simulations into their lectures. This would not only capture the attention of students but also facilitate better understanding and retention of complex concepts.\nMoreover, multimedia facilities can accommodate different learning preferences and cater to the needs of students with varying abilities, ensuring a more inclusive learning environment. Additionally, the use of multimedia technology fosters creativity and critical thinking skills among students by encouraging them to explore, analyze, and synthesize information in innovative ways.\nI believe that the introduction of multimedia facilities in classrooms aligns with X College's commitment to providing quality education and preparing students for success in a rapidly evolving world. Therefore, I urge you to consider this proposal favorably and take the necessary steps to implement multimedia facilities in our college classrooms.\nThank you for considering my suggestion. I am confident that this initiative will greatly benefit the academic community at X College and contribute to the overall enhancement of our educational experience.\nYours sincerely,\n[Your Name] [Your Course/Department] [Your Roll/ID Number]"

          "explanation": "Folk Music and Modern Music\nMusic is a group of sounds that people have arranged in a pleasing or meaningful way. Folk music and Modern music are two genres of music that have remained popular throughout history. Each has their distinct characteristics, and both are important genres of music. Folk music reminds us of our cultural heritage and connects us to a communal identity. On the other hand, Modern music mirrors the evolution of society and embraces new forms of musical expression. Folk music is traditional music that originates from a particular community or culture. This type of music has been passed down from generation to generation and usually tells stories about everyday life experiences. Modern music, on the contrary, is a popular form of music that has developed in recent times. This genre of music includes various styles such as rock, pop, hip-hop, and electronic music. Again, Folk music is often described as raw, soulful, and authentic. On the other hand, Modern music is seen as being more innovative and experimental, utilizing electronic sounds, digital effects, and creative music production. Audience is another difference here. Folk music is often associated with a classy and sophisticated audience who understands the tradition and culture behind it. Modern music has a wider these appeal and is enjoyed by people from different cultures and backgrounds. Though there are many differences between two genres, both Folk music and Modern music share some common features like lyricism, melody, and rhythm. Many modern songs are inspired by Folk music elements and are often combined with electronic sounds to create a unique sound that appeals to modern audiences. Irrespective of our preferences, music is a universal language that speaks to our souls and unites us as human beings.\n"

          "explanation": "Causes and Effects of Unemployment in Bangladesh\nUnemployment refers to the state of a person, capable of working, unable to find a paid job. In Bangladesh, unemployment still remains as one of the significant challenges. In order to address this issue hindering economic growth, the causes of unemployment need to be explored first. Rapid population growth is a major factor behind the unemployment rate. In comparison to the population, there are not enough job opportunities in the market. So, when a fresh graduate or anyone from the working-age enters the job market, the competition is quite fierce for a single seat. On the other hand, due to the digitalization of the country, laborers are being replaced with machines in the work field. Although automation helps businesses by improving its productivity and accuracy, it leaves a gap in the job market by reducing job opportunities. Lack of proper training and workoriented education are some of the other contributing factors regarding unemployment. The effect of unemployment falls directly on the economy of the country. Without a source of an income, unemployed people fail to provide themselves and their families with basic necessities. As a result, their standard of living meets no improvement. The pressure of finding a job and affording expenses collectively may cause extreme mental health issues for the people involved. It is a serious issue that the government cannot fix alone; we should all come forward to build a better nation by reducing unemployment in the country."
