People could cope with the crisis (সংকট) by buying water or collecting it from nearby tubewells. But recently, it has assumed so serious a form that they cannot manage it anyway. Actually, for most part of the day, people remain deprived (বঞ্চিত) of the facility of water supply. In this situation, we. need a rapid solution (সমাধান) to this crisis.\nI, therefore, pray and hope that you would be considerate enough to take immediate steps to solve the-problem of insufficient water supply and oblige thereby.\nYours faithfully,\nPavel Rahman\nOn behalf of the people of Chawkbazar area under Cumilla City Corporation"

          "explanation": "The International Mother Language Day\nMother language means a language through which the people of a country express their ideas, thoughts, feelings and emotions clearly. The 21st February is the International Mother Language Day. In order to show due honour and respect to the existing mother languages of different countries, the day has been declared as International Mother Language Day by UNESCO. In reply to a proposal from Bangladesh Govt., the declaration has come to reality. The day has a long glorious historical background (পটতৃমি). It is a matter of great regret that the then rulers of Pakistan tried to impose \"Urdu' as the state language upon us instead of Bangla. Before the independence of our country in 1952, the then Pakistani ruler Jinnah declared in the public meeting that \"Urdu and only Urdu shall be the state language of Pakistan.\". The people of our country burst into (ফ্টে পড়া) protest against this unjustified decision. Some of the heroic sons of this soil came forward and sacrificed their valuable lives for the cause of the mother tongue on the 21 st February. 1952. The objective of observing the day is to pay homage to the language martyrs. The day is greatly important for the people of Bangladesh. Now, it is a matter of great pleasure and prestige that this day got international recognition (ন্বীकৃতি) in 1999 as International Mother Language Day."

          "explanation": "The City Life and Country Life\nThe difference between county life and city life is strikingly (আকর্ষণীয়ভাবে) remarkable (উল্লেখযোগ্য). Rural areas are adorned with natural beauty while urban areas are adorned only with numerous highrise attractive buildings. City life being furnished (সজ্জিত) with modern facilities, city-dwellers can enjoy better life. Here people get better medical facilities; better education, good sanitation, advanced communication and transport system, better recreation and most importantly better opportunities for employment, and making money through business and trade. On the contrary, rural people are deprived (বঞ্চিত) of good medical facilities, better scopes of getting good education, enjoying rapid and comfortable (আরামদায়ক) travelling or movement, running business and trade. Because here there are no good educational instructions, good hospitals with highly skilled and experienced doctors good road networks. On the other hand, cities are the hub (চক্রকেন্দ্র) of business and cotmmercial activities. Here, there is a great number of mills and factories, offices, shopping malls, supermarkets, etc. Consequently (অতএব), huge number of people get employment facilities. Urban people can pass pleasant time in zoo, parks, museums (জাদুঘর), theatres, cinema halls, clubs and some other attractive places. Contrarily, rural people bereft of these things, spend their time gossiping, playing or watching. TV. But city life is full of hustle and bustle (তাড়াহুড়া ও ছুটছুটি) and afflicted (পীড়িত) with pollution. Here people become sick due to various types of pollution. They cannot have pure and fresh foods. On the contrary, rural life being free of hustle and bustle and mechanical business, people here live a peaceful life. Rural people being simple and easy-going, they live in peace and amity with others. But their peaceful life often becomes disturbed owing to village politics. However, city life surpasses (অতিক্রম করা) rural life by virtue of various advantages. So, it is always attractive and appealing (আবেদনময়)."
