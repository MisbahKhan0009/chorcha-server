I am writing to you, on behalf of the students of Dhaka College, to propose the establishment of an English Language Club within the college premises.\nAs a second-year college student, I have observed a growing interest among my peers in improving their English language skills. However, we feel that our current academic curriculum may not adequately cater to the practical aspects of language learning, such as speaking and listening proficiency.\nThe proposed English Language Club would serve as a platform for students to enhance their English language abilities through various interactive activities, such as debates, discussions, public speaking sessions, and language games. Additionally, the club could organize workshops, seminars, and guest lectures by language experts to provide valuable insights and guidance.\nMoreover, the English Language Club would foster a sense of camaraderie among students with a shared interest in language learning, promoting cultural exchange and mutual support.\nWe believe that the establishment of an English Language Club would complement our academic endeavors and contribute to our personal and professional development. Therefore, we earnestly request your support and approval for this initiative.\nThank you for considering our proposal. We look forward to your positive response and guidance on how to proceed further with this endeavor.\nSincerely,\nMotin\n[Your Signature]"

          "explanation": "Impact of Climate Change in Bangladesh\nLong-term variation in temperatures and weather patterns is known as climate change. The frequent\nshift of climate in Bangladesh has been showing a number of devastating effects, such as, rising sea level, floods and intensifying cyclones, Firstly, Rising sea level is a growing threat to people all around Bangladesh. To illustrate, Two-thirds of the land of this country is less than fifteen feet above sea level. So, the increase of sea level might cause extinction of huge low land area, Respondingly, The dwellers of the area may have to migrate from their own land. Secondly, Climate change is making rainfall more erratic and often far more intense. In terms of Bangladesh, this reality has recently become quite evident, Because of irregular rain and melting the Himalayan glaciers, Bangladesh is now far more vulnerable to devastating floods, Lastly and more importantly, The Bay of Bangal narrows towards its northern shore where it meets the south of coast Bangladesh. This narrowing can both direct cyclones towards Bangladesh's coast and make them more intense. To conclude, to minimize climate change, some immediate steps could be taken such as planting more trees, reducing the use of CFC gases, using electric vehicles, recycling plastic materials, In a word, People should practice eco-friendly behaviors to protect the nature as well as themselves.\n\n"

          "question": "",
          "explanation": "\nThe world is losing most of its natural resources as and when you read this. There are many factors which are making this happen, however, one major concern is that of deforestation. Human activities are resulting in deforestation at a very rapid rate. Moreover, the effects of this activity are very dangerous. We do not realize the damage we are causing to living beings as well as the vegetation by cutting down trees. It will be clearer if we understand the impact of deforestation and make attempts to prevent it.\n\nImpact of Deforestation\nWhen we cut down even a single tree, the impact it has is huge. Now imagine if we clear out whole forests only altogether, how damaging would that be. We cut down forests to meet the needs of humans. In order to fulfill the agricultural, commercial, industrial, residential and other needs we remove forests. Most of the earth was covered with forests until a hundred years ago, however, now we don’t have much of them left.\nDeforestation causes disruption in the ecological balance. Moreover, it also interferes with the lives of wildlife and human beings as well. Firstly, when there won’t be many forests left, the water cycle of the earth will get disturbed. There won’t be enough trees left to absorb the water. Moreover, it will cause floods and droughts too. Similarly, soil erosion will be another effect of deforestation.\nOther than that, the climate will experience massive change. Global warming is also happening partly due to deforestation only. The oxygen level in the atmosphere will drop down by a great number and thus naturally carbon dioxide levels will increase. Most importantly, the wildlife is losing their habitats due to deforestation. Forests are their only home and with no place left to go, they either lose their lives or wreak havoc in the cities.\nTherefore, we must all come together to stop this from happening and saving our earth as well as our lives. Humans must not be so selfish so as to make other animals homeless to shelter themselves. We must not damage our vegetation to create a beautiful garden for ourselves.\nHow to Prevent Deforestation?\nWe can do a lot of things that will contribute to preventing deforestation. To begin with, do not waste paper. The more demand there will be the more supply will happen. This way, trees will keep getting cut to meet these needs.\nSimilarly, the government must put a ban on deforestation so the big firms can find other alternatives instead of clearing forests for commercial and industrial needs. The laws must be made stringent enough and also implemented properly to prevent it.\nMoreover, there must be measures taken to control the increasing population. As there are more mouths to feed and fewer resources, our nature and forests are getting burdened. There is not adequate supply to meet the ever-increasing demands of the population. Thus, the lesser the demand, the better the conditions of the forests as well."
