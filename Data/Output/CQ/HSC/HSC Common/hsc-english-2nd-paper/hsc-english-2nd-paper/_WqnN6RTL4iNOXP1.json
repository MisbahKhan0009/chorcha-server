          "question": "",
          "explanation": "On-campus classes offer a traditional learning environment that fosters face-to-face interaction between students and instructors, facilitating immediate feedback and active participation. The physical presence of peers encourages collaboration and socialization, enriching the educational experience. Additionally, access to campus facilities such as libraries and laboratories enhances hands-on learning opportunities. However, on-campus classes may pose challenges such as commuting, scheduling conflicts, and limited flexibility for students with job or family commitments.\nOn the other hand, online classes provide unparalleled convenience and flexibility, allowing students to access course materials and participate in discussions from anywhere with an internet connection. This flexibility is particularly beneficial for non-traditional students or those balancing work and education. Online classes often offer a diverse range of multimedia resources and asynchronous learning options, accommodating different learning styles. However, the lack of face-to-face interaction can hinder opportunities for spontaneous discussions and immediate clarification of doubts. Additionally, technical issues and a potential sense of isolation may detract from the overall learning experience. Balancing the merits and demerits of both options is crucial for selecting the most suitable mode of learning based on individual needs and preferences."
