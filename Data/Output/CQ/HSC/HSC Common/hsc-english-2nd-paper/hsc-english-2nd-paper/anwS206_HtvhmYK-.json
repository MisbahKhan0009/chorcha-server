          "explanation": "The Causes and Effects of Moral Degradation of Young Generation\nMoral values are those set of standards by. which we distinguish between right and wrong. Degradation (অবক্ষষয়)' of moral 'values or moral degradation among the younger generation is an emerging issue. The erosion in moral values has taken a dangerous turn. The revolution in science and technology . has made our life easy and reachable. But, we should realize that our moral degradation is making our society ruthless (নিষ্ঠুর) than ever. We had a rich culture where people respected each other and there was harmony in the community in religious and social issues. But today when we keep eyes in'the dailies, we cannot but be ashamed and thundered as we have to see the news of pervading cruelty, notoriousness, rape, bribery, killing, trafficking, adulteration of food, medicine, leaking of question papers and what not. But what is causing our society to engage in such ominous (অশুভ/ভীতিজনক) deeds? We don't need to go far to seek the answer. It is nothing but lack of moral teaching and religious counselling in educational and social institutions. The greed for money and power, injustice and discrimination in society, excessive desire or mania to gain something illegally and disrespecting the law of the country are also the causes of present degradation of moral or social values among the youths. But, time is passing away fast to think over the issues. So, it is time that recovery must be started from the grass roots and the leaders, parents, teachers, and other social stakeholders must understand that the need of the moment is to acknowledge the most heinous moral degradation."
