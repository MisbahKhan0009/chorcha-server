Unlike the animals however, man's relationships give meaning to his existence and inspires him to do well in education, in workplace or in a profession that he pursues . Relationships are of different kinds: Some are familial and intimate , formed by blood and by marriage; some are social like the ones we have with friends and some are made in school where we form close bonds with classmates and teachers. Relationship can also be fostered in workplace, which may quickly change from professional to social.

          "explanation": "Importance of Moral Values\nMoral values are the foundation of a good and meaningful life. They guide human behavior, helping us distinguish between right and wrong. Values like honesty, kindness, respect, and responsibility shape our character and influence how we treat others. A person with strong moral values earns trust and respect in society. In schools, homes, and communities, teaching these values is essential for building a peaceful and ethical world. Without them, society becomes selfish, unjust, and chaotic. Moral values also help us make better decisions, even in difficult situations. They are not just rules, but the inner compass that leads to personal growth and harmony. In today’s fast-paced world, where materialism often takes over, moral values remind us of what truly matters. They are vital for both personal success and a better society."

          "explanation": "Junk Food and Healthy Food\nJunk food and healthy food are two opposite ends of the dietary spectrum. Junk food—like chips, burgers, sugary drinks, and fried snacks—is tasty but loaded with fats, sugar, and harmful additives. It offers little nutritional value and, when eaten regularly, can lead to obesity, diabetes, and heart problems. In contrast, healthy food includes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and nuts. These foods are rich in vitamins, minerals, and fiber, boosting immunity and keeping the body strong. While junk food gives instant pleasure, healthy food builds long-term wellness. Choosing wisely between the two can shape our future health."
