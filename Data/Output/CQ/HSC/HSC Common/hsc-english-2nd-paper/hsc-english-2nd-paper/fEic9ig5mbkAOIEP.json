Most of them are unemployed and frustrated youths, coming of noble families. They have become a great headache to their parents. It is reported that a number of youths belonging to the respectable families have already gone astray owing to the fatal trap of drugs. They do not feel hesitant to commit any crime like robbery, snatching, kidnapping, killing just to collect money to buy harmful drugs. Taking harmful drugs, they cause great harm to their bodies. They create disturbance not only in their own family but also  in society. Social stability is hampered by them. As they lose morality, they do not feel bad to tease girls or women and eve to rape them.\n\n\nAccording to the dependable sources, most of the cities and towns of Bangladesh have become the crime zone. Specially the slum areas are the sanctuary of the drug businessmen and the addicted. Consequently people cannot sleep opening their windows. Passers-by don’t feel secured at night. Because the addicts disturb them and snatch their belongings.\n\n\n\nGovernment should take necessary measures to stop drug trafficking and help the addicted youths to come back to normal life.\n"

It is part and parcel of Bengali culture and tradition (ঐতিহ্য). So, the day is observed with traditional festivity (উল্লাস) across the country. People in villages celebrate this day as per their agelong customs. Special meals are arranged at home and Boishakhi Melas are held in different places. It is a day of great pleasure to the village people and children. City dwellers (নগরবাসী) also celebrate this day with delight. Girls and women put on yellow saris and boys put on pajamapanjabi. Some people eat watered-rice with onion, green chilli and hilsha fish. Shopkeepers in both towns and villages open new accounts books (হালখাতা) and offer sweets to their customers and this is the most impressive part of the celebration. Different cultural organizations offer different programmes. The celebration of Pahela Boishakh bears a great importance for us. It is passed by holding and enjoying festive programmes and functions. People living in Dhaka attend the Gano Sangeeter Ashor at Ramna Batamul in the morning. We reap great benefits from this kind of festival. It makes us stick to our traditional native culture. At the same time, it strengthens national unity making us forget the differences of religion, colour, race, etc. On this day, we get inspired to forget all the sorrows and failures (ব্যর্থতা) of the past year and to start a new life. with new vigour (বলিষ্ঠতা) and inspiration."

Though our main duty is to study hard, we also have a responsibility to help others in need.\nThere are many problems in our communities that we can try to solve through social work. Many people in villages and slums are uneducated. During holidays, we students can go to these areas to teach basic reading and writing. We can start makeshift schools under trees to educate both children and adults. Knowledge is power, and education can uplift their lives.\nPoverty is also widespread across Bangladesh. We can encourage self-sufficiency by teaching vocational skills like sewing, farming, and small business management. We can work with microfinance organizations to help villagers take small loans to start their own enterprises. Financial independence can alleviate their hardship.\nHealth awareness is lacking, especially among the poor. We can educate people about cleanliness, nutrition, vaccinations, and preventive care. Girls can be especially effective in teaching women about maternal health, childcare and women’s rights. We can also run free health camps for checkups and medicine distribution.\nSome regions face problems like water scarcity. We can mobilize resources to build wells and set up water filters to provide clean drinking water. We can teach sustainable practices like rainwater harvesting that people can implement themselves. Ensuring water access can greatly improve quality of life.\nWhen floods, cyclones and other disasters hit Bangladesh, students can jump into action as volunteers. We can collect food, clothes and medicine to distribute to affected families. We can also directly participate in response efforts by helping evacuate people, setting up shelters, and providing emergency medical aid.\nAs youth, we represent progress, compassion and social justice. Every small effort we make improves our communities. The young generation has energy and inspiration that is vital for national development. Through continued education and service, we can create solutions and uplift our nation. We, the students of today, will lead Bangladesh towards prosperity tomorrow."
