For many different reasons, English has achieved the prestige of being that language. As a result, it has crossed national borders to reach people who speak other languages. It is no longer the unique possession of British or American people, but a language that belongs to the world's people. In fact, bilingual and multilingual users of English far outnumber its monolingual native speakers. This phenomenon has led to a bewildering variety of English around the world. As more and more people speak English, more and more varieties have emerged which are strongly influenced by the pronunciation, grammar and idioms of the respective mother tongues. World English has now moved away from the control of the native speakers. However, the question of British or American English is not so important now. Today's slogan is mutual intelligibility among users of the language.\n\n(a) obviously (synonym); (b) obviously (antonym); (c) prestige (synonym); (d) phenomenon (synonym); (e) unique (antonym); (f) belong (synonym); (g) outnumber (synonym); (h) monolingual (antonym); (i) native (antonym); (j) variety (synonym); (k) emerge (antonym); (l) control (antonym) (m) bewildering (synonym); (n) intelligibility (antonym).",

There is no sign of normal price rates in the market. Rice, vegetables, oll, fish or meat- all have gone out of the reach of the people with fixed income. No one knows what their budget will be in the next month or the next week. The shopkeepers give lame excuses for this price hike. It is a common phenomenon that the consumers have to experience frequently.\nBut, the same thing sells at different prices at different shops in the market. This clearly indicates There is no want of supply in the market, but you need the extra cash to afford your kitchen and everything else. Sometimes, the authority concerned make occasional inspections and, fine the culprits but that cannot prevent them from what they are doing. In fact, at least it seems, people have undergone a severe mental distortion. Moral sense has gone dry and monetary pursuit has become victorious. However, the government should take all the necessary measures to check any further hike and people should come to sense to live in a harmonious society."

          "explanation": "\nFemale education is not just a matter of providing schooling to girls; it is a fundamental right and a powerful tool for social and economic development. When girls are educated, they gain the knowledge, skills, and confidence to pursue their dreams and contribute meaningfully to society. One of the primary benefits of female education is its positive impact on health outcomes. Educated women are more likely to make informed decisions about their health and that of their families, leading to lower maternal and child mortality rates. Additionally, female education plays a crucial role in breaking the cycle of poverty. Educated women have better employment opportunities and higher earning potential, enabling them to support themselves and their families financially. Moreover, educating girls fosters gender equality by challenging traditional gender roles and stereotypes. It empowers women to participate actively in decision-making processes, both at home and in society, and promotes a more inclusive and equitable society overall. Furthermore, female education has far-reaching effects on community development, as educated women are more likely to invest in their children's education and contribute to the socioeconomic development of their communities. Therefore, investing in female education is not only a moral imperative but also a strategic investment in the future prosperity and well-being of nations.\n"

          "explanation": "The Causes and Effects of Drug Addiction on the Individual, Family and Overall Society\nDrug is an essential element of human life. But abuse of drugs affects the nervous system (স্নায়ুতন্ত্র) of our body seriously. Drug addiction means a strong desire for a drug which the addict cannot resist. Narcotics like opium, morphine, heroin, marijuana, cocaine, etc. are used by the addicts. These drugs are used for their intoxicating ( উন্মাদক), tranquillizing and stimulating effects. If a person gets addicted to any of these once, he cannot go without it. Drug addiction is a curse of modern civilization. Drugs make youngsters go astray and destroy many valuable and beautiful lives. There are some reasons for drug addiction such as, frustration, bad association, availability of intoxicant, unemployment, failure in love, degradation of religious values, lack of family ties, etc. When a young person falls into a completely hopeless situation, drugs allure him. Sometimes young boys and girls come in contact with drugs out of curiosity. Drug addiction creates social problems. Narcotics (মাদকদ্রব্য) are very expensive. So. the addicted person often goes for stealing, hijacking and all sorts of misdeeds to procure money for buying drugs. He can, in no circumstances, refrain from taking drugs. He tries to have it at any cost. It helps him to see strange things that have no existence at all to him. The drug addict also does something that ruins the peace of the family. He even steals ornaments, utensils, clothes and what not to procure money for buying drugs. So, all other members of the family remain in tension for his misdeeds. The fate of the addict is pathetic. He dies a painful death losing character: He becomes a burden not only for the family but also for the society and also for the nation. The remedy for drug addiction is not very easy. Drug addiction is not only a national but also a global problem. To save our young generation from drug addiction, the government and educated people should come forward with necessary remedies. Strong measures should be taken to stop the production and trafficking (পাচার) of drugs. Drug business is punishable (শাস্তিযোগ্য) and the highest punishment is death sentence in Bangladesh. This law should be enforced immediately."
