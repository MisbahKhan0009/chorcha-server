You must also have been taught to be polite in company and keep quiet while others, especially your elders, spoke. Possibly, you at times grudged such schooling. Possibly, at times you even protested such disciplining. Now, certainly you know that you can't always behave the way you want specially in the presence of others. There are rules of behavior you have to follow in a company. We are social beings and have to consider the effect of our behavior on others, even if we are at home and dealing with our family members.\nWe have two terms to describe our social behavior- 'etiquette' and 'manners'. 'Etiquette' is a French word and it means the rules of correct behavior in society. The word 'manners' means the behavior that is considered to be polite in a particular society or culture.\nManners can be good or bad. For example, it is a bad manner to speak with food in one's mouth. No one likes a bad mannered person. Remember that etiquette and manners vary from culture to culture and from society to society.",

Additionally, you must have been taught to be polite in public and to be silent when others, particularly your elders, spoke. Maybe you sometimes regretted your education. Maybe you even resisted such discipline at times. You are aware that you cannot always act in the way you like, especially when other people are present.\nEtiquette and manners are two words we use to describe how we behave in social situations. You can have good or awful manners. Speaking while chewing food, for instance, is impolite. A rude individual is not popular. Keep in mind that manners and etiquette differ from culture to culture and from society to society.\nEtiquette and manners are lessons we pick up from our parents, families, and other institutions like schools, colleges, or professional organisations."

As a government employee, my, father was working in Khulna. Then we lived in an apartment in a five-storeyed building. In the same building, there lived one of my childhood friends Shihab and his family. Shihab was then my best friend. We read in the same class and same school. We were so deeply connected to each other that we used to spend a considerable (বেশকিছু অংশ) part of the day together. However, on my fifth birthday, he gave me a teddy bear as a gift. I still remember we. the two friends, enjoyed heavenly pleasure while playing with our toys. We were passing blissful (সুখময়) time together. But a cursed time came when his father was transferred to Dhaka. We got separated. I became gloomy losing my best friend. However, we were connected through mobile phones. We regularly talked to each other and exchanged our feelings, important events, etc. Then came the most cursed moment when I heard the news of his death in a road accident. Hearing the news I got senseless (বেহুশ) and had to be hospitalized. When I got back to my sense, I cried a lot. My parents also experienced a great sense of bereavement (বিচ্ছেদ), as. if they had lost their another child: However, the teddy bear is now the only thing of reminiscence of Shihab. It is now the most important thing to me. I often feel he is alive. I remember that he handed me the teddy bear smilingly. That instinctive facial expression of divine love still makes me cry like a child. I cherish (লালান করা) his memory with great love and affection. I will preserve this toy all through my life. I feel Shihab's existence through this teddy bear."

          "explanation": "Causes and Effects of Corruption in Bangladesh\nCorruption means adopting dishonest and illegal ways by a person or an organization entrusted . (দায়িত্বপ্রাপ্ত) in a position of authority in order to gain illicit (অবৈধ্য) benefits. Corruption is now rampant(ব্যাপক/অনিয়ন্ত্রিত) administration. Corruption is seen in various forms in our country. The most common forms of corruption are bribery, nepotism. extortion, lobbying, cronyism, embezzlement, exerting political influence, fraudulence, graft, and abuse of power. There are many causes of correction. The main causes of corruption are avarice, greed for power, poverty, impiety, moral degeneration, lack of good governance, corrupt politics, political instability, lack of rule of law. lack of accountability (জবাবদিহিতা), etc. Corruption is a great curse for a country. It gradually weakens a country's political, social and economic systems. It hampers national growth and thus has an adverse impact on the growth of every individual in a country. Due to corruption, people become deprived of justice. They experience indescribable suffering. As a result of corruption, unfit or unworthy people occupy important posts in the administration. Brilliant students despite* having merit or qualification cannot get jobs. People become victims of injustice in judicial system. People cannot get their just or legal things done without bribing the people in authority. When worthy educated people become deprived of justice in the process of employment, they suffer from depression and resort to various criminal activities. Unworthy people employed in important posts cannot lead the country towards prosperity. In short, the Impossible become possible through money, political power, etc. Consequently, the country suffers, greatly. Thus, corruption is a great evil for a country. In order to remove corruption from our country, people of all walks of life have to work unitedly. bring revolutionary has to work with honesty; sincerity, accountability, and the rule of law. It has to be given proper punishment. In fact, to rid society of corruption, we have to work from family level so that children grow up with moral education, based on piety (ধর্মানুরাগ), honesty and justice."
