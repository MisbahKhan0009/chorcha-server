          "explanation": "The Padma Multipurpose Bridge\nThe Padma Multipurpose Bridge is a multipurpose road-rail bridge across the Padma River. Bangladesh has constructed the bridge with its own resources. It connects Loúhajong, Munshiganj to Shariatpur and Madaripur. Thus, it links the south-west of the country to northern and eastern regions. Actually, it has connected 21 southern districts with the capital. The bridge is a two-level steel truss bridge that carries a four-lane highway on the upper level and a singletrack railway on the lower level. Having 41 spans, each 150 m long and 204 steel piles and 32 vertical bored concrete piles, the bridge is 6.15 km long and 18.18 m wide. The rail viaduct has 14 spans of 332 m connecting Mawa end to Jajira end. Apart from transportation, there are other utilities like gas transmission line, optical fiber and telephone line and high voltage electric line through the bridge. The bridge has been constructed by China Railway Major Bridge Engineering Company Limited. The project has taken 1062 hectares of land. Starting on 7 December 2014, the construction ended in June 2022. This dream bridge was inaugurated on June 25, 2022 and was opened for vehicles the following day. The Padma Bridge is the most expensive project in the history of Bangladesh. However, the bridge will contribute a lot to the economic development of Bangladesh. It will increase the GDP by as much as 1.2 percent. Thus, the Padma Multipurpose Bridge is a huge milestone in the construction history of Bangladesh,"

          "explanation": "Causes and Effects of Unemployment in Bangladesh\nUnemployment refers to the state of a person, capable of working, unable to find a paid job. In Bangladesh, unemployment still remains as one of the significant challenges. In order to address this issue hindering economic growth, the causes of unemployment need to be explored first. Rapid population growth is a major factor behind the unemployment rate. In comparison to the population, there are not enough job opportunities in the market. So, when a fresh graduate or anyone from the working-age enters the job market, the competition is quite fierce for a single seat. On the other hand, due to the digitalization of the country, laborers are being replaced with machines in the work field. Although automation helps businesses by improving its productivity and accuracy, it leaves a gap in the job market by reducing job opportunities. Lack of proper training and workoriented education are some of the other contributing factors regarding unemployment. The effect of unemployment falls directly on the economy of the country. Without a source of an income, unemployed people fail to provide themselves and their families with basic necessities. As a result, their standard of living meets no improvement. The pressure of finding a job and affording expenses collectively may cause extreme mental health issues for the people involved. It is a serious issue that the government cannot fix alone; we should all come forward to build a better nation by reducing unemployment in the country."
