Macroeconomic volatility, exacerbated by inflation and currency depreciation, has deepened financial distress among vulnerable populations. Political discord, fueled by contentious elections and governance inefficiencies, erodes social cohesion and deters foreign investment. Environmental degradation, driven by climate change and unregulated industrialization, has intensified floods, cyclones, and ecological imbalances, The education sector, thought expanding, remains hindered by pedagogical stagnation, infrastructural deficits, and a widening urban-rural divide. Soaring unemployment rates, particularly among graduates, underscore a profound disconnect between academic curricula and labor market demands. Addressing these systemic crises necessitates comprehensive economic restructuring, political stabilization, and sustainable governance to safeguard Bangladesh's developmental aspirations.\n(a) trajectory (synonym); (b) formidable (antonym); (c) volatility (synonym); (d) exacerbated (antonym); (e) vulnerable (antonym) (f) contentious, (synonym); (g) cohesion (antonym); (h) degradation (synonym); (i) stagnation (synonym); (j) deficits (antonym); (k) Soaring (antonym); (l) underscore (synonym); (m) comprehensive (antonym); (n) safeguard (antonym).",

          "explanation": "Challenges in the Educational System of Bangladesh\nEducation is very important for the progress of a country. But in Bangladesh, there are many challenges in the education system. First, many children, especially in villages, do not go to school. Some schools are far away, and some families are too poor to send their children to school. Many students drop out early because they have to work and help their families. Second, there are not enough schools, classrooms, and teachers. Many schools have too many students in one class. This makes it hard for teachers to give proper attention to each student. Some schools do not have good facilities like clean toilets, libraries, and playgrounds. Third, the quality of education is not the same everywhere. Some schools give better education, but many students in government schools do not get proper learning materials. It is also a fact that many teachers are not well-trained. Lastly, the political disorder in our country creates challenges for our education system. Publishing error-free books is also a challenge for the government in education sector. However, the government is trying to improve the standard of education. If we all work together, every child in Bangladesh can get a good education and build a better future."

          "explanation": "Student Politics in Bangladesh\nWhen students take part in political activities, it is called 'Student politics'. In Bangladesh, student politics has a long history. During the Language Movement of 1952 and the Liberation War of 1971, students played a big role. They fought for the country's freedom and rights. Today, student politics exists in almost all universities and colleges. Many students join different political groups. Some of them work for student rights, like better education, lower fees, and good facilities. But sometimes, student politics causes problems. Some students misuse politics for personal gain. There are fights and violence between different groups. This creates a bad environment in educational institutions. Many students feel unsafe, and their studies are disturbed. Student politics can be good if students work for the welfare of others. They should focus on helping people and improving education. But if they get involved in violence, it is harmful for the country. The government and universities should make sure that student politics is peaceful and helpful. Education should be the first priority for students. If student politics is done in the right way, it can help build a better future for Bangladesh."
