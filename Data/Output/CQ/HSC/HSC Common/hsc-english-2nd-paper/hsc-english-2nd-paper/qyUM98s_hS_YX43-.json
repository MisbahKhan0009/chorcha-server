In this modern era of education, the integration of multimedia tools such as projectors, screens, and computers has become essential to enhance the learning experience.\nCurrently, our classes rely on traditional methods of teaching, which, while effective, do not fully engage students in today’s digital world. The addition of multimedia facilities would not only make lessons more interactive but also help students understand complex topics more easily by providing visual and auditory learning materials.\nWe kindly request you to consider our appeal and take the necessary steps to provide multimedia facilities in our classrooms. We are confident that this will greatly improve the quality of education and contribute to the academic success of all students.\nWe sincerely hope that you will consider our request and take prompt action.\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\nYours faithfully, [Your Name] [Class/Department Name]"

          "explanation": "Price Hike\nPrice hike is the rise in the prices of essential commodities. It is the widely discussed issue in the price market all over the world including Bangladesh. Price hike occurs when the prices of goods increase due to supply-side constraints. It also occurs as a result of increase in prices in the world. The hike or spiral in essential commodities usually occurs where there is a huge demand of a particular commodity than its supply. But it is a regular phenomenon in our country. Prices of essentials continue to rise almost every day. The impacts of price hike are manifold. The poor and underprivileged people are the worst sufferers. They find it difficult to pass their days affording food to the family members due to the increasing prices of daily essentials. The country's economy faces a meltdown for the price hike. What we need to do at first is to control the price hike of essentials. For that, we must check the syndicated groups of greedy businessmen who mainly increase prices of commodities to make more profits. The government must take effective steps to grow more food. Food security must be ensured."

          "explanation": "Living in a Nuclear Family and an Extended Family\nI live in an extended family. Despite having some problems, I am happy. But nowadays, nuclear families are increasing in numbers. Our life has become very busy. At the same time, being bound to live in cities in search of income, people have become detached from their parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts and cousins. They live in cities with their wives and children only. But life in cities is not so easy nowadays. So, with the gradual increase of the price of daily commodities, they cannot send money to the extended families in villages. In a nuclear family, children can grow up in a suitable environment. There they are brought up soundly. But in reality, the children in a nuclear family feel lonely. They cannot share their feelings with others. Their parents remain busy most of the time. So, they become mentally upset. Human mind is very sensitive. So, everyone wants to have someone to share one's distress and happiness. I don't support a nuclear family, because in it, family members become self- centered in most cases. It is, in fact, a reality of modern life that people become bound to form a nuclear family in the long distant cities."
