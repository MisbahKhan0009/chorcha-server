          "explanation": "\nTo The Principal [Your College Name] [College Address]\nSubject: Application for increasing library facilities\nSir,\nWith due respect, I would like to draw your kind attention to the fact that the library of our college is lacking in several important facilities which are essential for our academic development. Many books are outdated, and there is a shortage of copies of popular reference books and textbooks. Additionally, there are very few seating arrangements, and the reading environment needs improvement.\nAs students of this esteemed institution, we depend heavily on the library for our studies and preparation for exams. Therefore, we earnestly request you to kindly take necessary steps to update the collection with recent and necessary books, increase the number of seating spaces, and improve the overall environment of the library.\nWe hope that you will consider our request sincerely and take appropriate action at your earliest convenience.\nYours obediently, [Your Name] Class: XII Roll No.: [Your Roll Number] [Your College Name]\n"

          "explanation": "Mental Healthcare\nMental healthcare means the process or treatment or some practices by which we can ensure a better mental state to perform wall in our everyday life. It is as important as our body's health. If we have good mental health, we can study well, play happily, and enjoy time with family and friends. But if our mental health is not good, we feel sad, tired, or angry all the time. Many things affect mental health. Too much study pressure, family problems, stress, anxiety, etc., can make us metally disturbed. In our country, many children feel worried about exams and school results. Some children also feel lonely because they have no friends to share their feelings. Bullying and too much screen time can also harm mental health. To keep good mental health, we should talk to our parents, teachers, or friends when we feel sad. Playing outside, reading books, and doing fun activities can make us happy. Eating healthy food and sleeping well help us feel fresh and active. We should also avoid negative thoughts and try to stay positive. A happy mind makes a happy life. If we take care of our mental health, we can grow up to be strong, confident, and successful."

          "explanation": "Attraction towards Fast Food\nFast food is very popular among people. In our country, urban people love to eat burgers, pizzas, fried chickens, and chips. These foods taste delicious and look very tempting. Many fast-food shops in big cities make tasty snacks, and people enjoy eating them with friends and family. One reason poeple like fast food is that it is quick and easy to buy. When families go out, they often eat at fast-food restaurants. Many kids also see fast food in TV ads, and they want to try it. Some fast-food shops even give free toys with meals, which makes children more excited. But eating too much fast food is not good for health. It has a lot of oil, salt, and sugar, which can make us unhealthy. Eating too much can cause stomach problems, weight gain, and weak teeth. Instead of fast food, we should brave balanced diet. We should eat home-cooked meals like rice, fish, vegetables, and fruits. These foods make us strong and healthy. Fast food is tasty, but we should not eat it every day. Eating it sometimes is acceptable, but healthy food is always the best choice. So, we have to be careful while choosing our food."
