          "explanation": "There is a proverb which tells us about the benefit of early rising: “Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise”.\nEarly rising is a good habit. It leads to improvement of health and prolongation of our life. It is the best time for prayer to God. The greatest advantage of early rising is that it gives a good start of a hard day’s work, while the others are still in bed. We can complete the day’s work without having to rush through it.\nA little exercise at this time will keep the early riser fit for the day. Walking in the open air at this time is also very pleasant. The birds sing, the air is fresh and there is serenity all over. Nature which is fresh and peaceful has a beauty of its own at this time.\nAll these refresh the mind and body of an early riser and make him fit for working hard. Early rising should be made a regular habit as it leads to happiness and good health."

          "explanation": "Family Life and Hostel Life\nMan is a social being. He has been living in society surrounded by families. After a day's business, people come back to their houses to live peacefully with the family members. But in this modern competitive age, human demands and necessities have increased to a large scale and we cannot meet all our needs sitting at home. Thus, we are forced to live away from our families either in messes or in hostels. It is known to all that we cannot get all the facilities of a family staying either in a mess or in a hostel. A hostel life cannot provide the parental love and guidance. The dwellers have to depend on self-service, which sometimes turns to be a blessing. In hostel life, a student learns to be fit for practical life and s/he becomes self-reliant. Since one has to manage everything by oneself, one learns how to cope with the realities of life. In hostel life, one gets complete liberty, which may cause havoc. If one is not conscious of one's time and duties, he/she can easily go astray. We get familial help and guidance in a family. But sometimes we have to perform some duties towards our families. Sometimes a student cannot make the best use of time. But in a hostel life, a student gets ample time to read and learn. In hostel life, a student can easily take other students' help, which is not available in a family life. In a family, the parents try to bring up their children in accordance with their wishes and ideology. The reckless students need complete familial control and guidance. For them, family is the best place. A careful and conscious person can easily do well either living in a family or in a hostel. In spite of having some merits and demerits, both in families and in hostels, both are needed in different circumstances."
