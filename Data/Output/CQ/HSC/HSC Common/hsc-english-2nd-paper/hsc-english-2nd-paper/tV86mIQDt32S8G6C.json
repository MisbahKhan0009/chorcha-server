          "explanation": "the causes and effects of drug addiction in Bangladesh :\nDrug addiction has become a serious social problem in Bangladesh, particularly among the youth. There are several causes behind this growing issue. One major cause is frustration due to unemployment, family problems, and social pressure. Many young people fall into addiction as an escape from stress, failure, or emotional pain. Peer pressure and curiosity also play a big role in leading teenagers toward drugs. In urban areas, easy availability of drugs such as yaba, heroin, and phensedyl worsens the situation. Lack of awareness and proper guidance from families and educational institutions also contributes to the spread of addiction.\nThe effects of drug addiction are extremely harmful to both individuals and society. Physically, it damages the health of the user, often leading to deadly diseases and even death. Mentally, it causes depression, anxiety, and loss of self-control. Socially, drug addicts may turn to crime, such as theft or violence, to support their habit. Families of addicts suffer from emotional and financial distress. Moreover, addiction lowers the productivity of the youth, weakening the overall development of the country.\nTo fight this problem, proper education, strong family support, and strict law enforcement are essential. Public awareness must also be raised to save the youth from this dangerous path.\n"
