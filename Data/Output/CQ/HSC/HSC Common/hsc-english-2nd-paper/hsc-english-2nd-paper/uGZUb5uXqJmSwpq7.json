As we look around, we discover beauty in pleasurable objects and sights-in nature, in the laughter of children, in the kindness of strangers . But asked to define, we run into difficulties. Does beauty have an independent objective identity? Is it universal , or is it dependent on our sense perceptions ? Does it lie in the eye of the beholder ?- we ask ourselves. A further difficulty arises when beauty manifests itself not only by its presence, but by its absence as well, as when we are repulsed by ugliness and desire beauty. But then ugliness has as much a place in our lives as beauty, or may be more as when there is widespread hunger and injustice in a society.

As a student of [Your Course/Department] at X College, I am writing to bring to your attention a proposal that I believe will significantly enhance the learning experience for all students: the introduction of multimedia facilities in classrooms.\nIn today's digital age, traditional teaching methods are being complemented, and in many cases replaced, by interactive and multimedia-based learning techniques. The integration of multimedia resources such as projectors, smart boards, and audiovisual equipment can greatly enrich the educational experience by making lessons more engaging, interactive, and accessible to diverse learning styles.\nMultimedia facilities in classrooms would enable instructors to incorporate a variety of teaching aids such as educational videos, interactive presentations, and digital simulations into their lectures. This would not only capture the attention of students but also facilitate better understanding and retention of complex concepts.\nMoreover, multimedia facilities can accommodate different learning preferences and cater to the needs of students with varying abilities, ensuring a more inclusive learning environment. Additionally, the use of multimedia technology fosters creativity and critical thinking skills among students by encouraging them to explore, analyze, and synthesize information in innovative ways.\nI believe that the introduction of multimedia facilities in classrooms aligns with X College's commitment to providing quality education and preparing students for success in a rapidly evolving world. Therefore, I urge you to consider this proposal favorably and take the necessary steps to implement multimedia facilities in our college classrooms.\nThank you for considering my suggestion. I am confident that this initiative will greatly benefit the academic community at X College and contribute to the overall enhancement of our educational experience.\nYours sincerely,\n[Your Name] [Your Course/Department] [Your Roll/ID Number]"

          "explanation": "The Padma Multi-purpose Bridge\nThe Padma Multi-purpose Bridge is the longest and most expensive (ব্যায়বহুল) construction across the mighty River Padma. It has connected the capital with 21 southern districts of Bangladesh. It is 6.15 kilometres long and 18.18 metres wide. It has 41 spans on 42 pillars. The cost of the mega project is Tk. 30,193.39 crore. This mega project is being funded from the own resources of the government of Bangladesh. It is a truss bridge and the material of the bridge is steel. The bridge has increased connectivity beyond the boundary. It has established direct road communication between Dhaka and the southern parts of the country. It has opened up huge possibilities in the tourism (পর্যটন) sectors in Bangladesh. Traders can take their goods directly to the capital. They can make profit by supplying their fresh products to the buyers. The bridge has cut the travel time between Dhaka and Mongla Port. It will reduce overall poverty and contribute to industrial development, regional trade, agricultural expansion, etc. Soon after its inauguration of the Padma Bridge by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on 25 June 2022.15,200 vehicles cross it in the first 8 hours. A total of 24000 vehicles cross the Padma Bridge every day. The bridge has ensured the increase of GDP growth rate by more than 1%. Due to poor connectivity economic operation in the south-western zone has not been too easy. Consequently (অতএব), the districts did not seize much industrialization (শিল্পায়ন). As a result, poverty and unemployment constitute major problem in this region. However, the Padma Bridge will offer many advantages to the region. It will unveil the door of opportunity for industrialization which will remove unemployment problem."

          "explanation": "\nEarly marriage—defined as marriage before the age of 18—is a persistent challenge in Bangladesh. Approximately 51% of girls marry before turning 18, the highest rate in South Asia and eighth highest globally (link.springer.com). Root causes are deeply woven into poverty , patriarchal norms , the dowry system , and concerns about girls’ safety. Poor rural families often perceive daughters as economic burdens and arrange early marriages to reduce expenses and dowry demands . Families also believe marriage offers security from premarital relationships or harassment .\nThe effects are profound: girls forced into early marriage frequently drop out of school, limiting their future opportunities (observerbd.com). Early pregnancy poses serious health risks—complications such as postpartum hemorrhage, high maternal and infant mortality, malnutrition, and anemia are common among teenage mothers (en.bonikbarta.com). Disrupted education also stunts girls’ personal and economic growth, reinforcing cycles of poverty and social inequality (observerbd.com). Additionally, early marriage increases vulnerability to intimate partner violence and limits young women’s agency in health and family decisions (link.springer.com).\nAddressing early marriage in Bangladesh requires a multifaceted approach: enforce laws like the Child Marriage Restraint Act more rigorously, improve girls’ access to education and economic resources, and drive cultural change through awareness campaigns targeting traditional norms ."
