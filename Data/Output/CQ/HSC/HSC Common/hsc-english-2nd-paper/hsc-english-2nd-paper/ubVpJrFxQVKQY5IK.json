          "explanation": "The City Life and Country Life\nThe difference between county life and city life is strikingly (আকর্ষণীয়ভাবে) remarkable (উল্লেখযোগ্য). Rural areas are adorned with natural beauty while urban areas are adorned only with numerous highrise attractive buildings. City life being furnished (সজ্জিত) with modern facilities, city-dwellers can enjoy better life. Here people get better medical facilities; better education, good sanitation, advanced communication and transport system, better recreation and most importantly better opportunities for employment, and making money through business and trade. On the contrary, rural people are deprived (বঞ্চিত) of good medical facilities, better scopes of getting good education, enjoying rapid and comfortable (আরামদায়ক) travelling or movement, running business and trade. Because here there are no good educational instructions, good hospitals with highly skilled and experienced doctors good road networks. On the other hand, cities are the hub (চক্রকেন্দ্র) of business and cotmmercial activities. Here, there is a great number of mills and factories, offices, shopping malls, supermarkets, etc. Consequently (অতএব), huge number of people get employment facilities. Urban people can pass pleasant time in zoo, parks, museums (জাদুঘর), theatres, cinema halls, clubs and some other attractive places. Contrarily, rural people bereft of these things, spend their time gossiping, playing or watching. TV. But city life is full of hustle and bustle (তাড়াহুড়া ও ছুটছুটি) and afflicted (পীড়িত) with pollution. Here people become sick due to various types of pollution. They cannot have pure and fresh foods. On the contrary, rural life being free of hustle and bustle and mechanical business, people here live a peaceful life. Rural people being simple and easy-going, they live in peace and amity with others. But their peaceful life often becomes disturbed owing to village politics. However, city life surpasses (অতিক্রম করা) rural life by virtue of various advantages. So, it is always attractive and appealing (আবেদনময়)."

          "explanation": "Impact of Climate Change in Bangladesh\nLong-term variation in temperatures and weather patterns is known as climate change. The frequent\nshift of climate in Bangladesh has been showing a number of devastating effects, such as, rising sea level, floods and intensifying cyclones, Firstly, Rising sea level is a growing threat to people all around Bangladesh. To illustrate, Two-thirds of the land of this country is less than fifteen feet above sea level. So, the increase of sea level might cause extinction of huge low land area, Respondingly, The dwellers of the area may have to migrate from their own land. Secondly, Climate change is making rainfall more erratic and often far more intense. In terms of Bangladesh, this reality has recently become quite evident, Because of irregular rain and melting the Himalayan glaciers, Bangladesh is now far more vulnerable to devastating floods, Lastly and more importantly, The Bay of Bangal narrows towards its northern shore where it meets the south of coast Bangladesh. This narrowing can both direct cyclones towards Bangladesh's coast and make them more intense. To conclude, to minimize climate change, some immediate steps could be taken such as planting more trees, reducing the use of CFC gases, using electric vehicles, recycling plastic materials, In a word, People should practice eco-friendly behaviors to protect the nature as well as themselves.\n\n"
