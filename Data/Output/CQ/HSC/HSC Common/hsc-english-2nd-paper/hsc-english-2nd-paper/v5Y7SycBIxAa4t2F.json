          "explanation": "10 July 2023\nThe Superintendent of Police, Pabna\n\nSubject: Taking necessary steps against antisocial activities in our locality, Sir,\n\nOn behalf of the people of Joypurhat, I, the undersigned, would like to draw your attention to the disturbing fact that we are badly suffering from some very hideous antisocial activities carried out by some mischievous elements in our locality.\nThey are making our lives difficult and risky in every way they can. They often taunt and tease college going youths especially the girls, hijack various vehicles, cheat the shopkeepers, give no fare to the rickshaw pullers, and behave roughly towards people and passers-by (পথচারী). Things turn worse after the sunset. They gather at the intersections (মোড়) of roads and footpaths to take narcotics such as hashish, phenyl, soporific drugs, and heroin. They sell various unauthorized things like forbidden drugs, illegal weapons, etc. here and there. Then they prey on passers-by and snatch away their belongings. Some people have been stabbed (ছুরিকাঘাত) and some others have been compelled to give them extortions. They have even threatened some persons with killing. So, we are all living in a frustrating (হতাশায়) situation with a premonition (পূর্বজ্ঞান) that conditions may deteriorate further.\nCommunity leaders and elderly citizens have tried to persuade them to come back to sense and stop bullying (গুন্ডামি) people. But they pay no heed at all. Now, we are seeking your kind measures to get rid of this crisis.\nI, therefore, pray and hope that you would be sympathetic enough to take effective steps to stop the antisocial activities and save us from the panic.\n\nSincerely yours.\nEmrul Chowdhury\nOn behalf of the people of Pabna"

          "explanation": "The Padma Multi-purpose Bridge\nThe Padma Multi-purpose Bridge is the longest and most expensive (ব্যায়বহুল) construction across the mighty River Padma. It has connected the capital with 21 southern districts of Bangladesh. It is 6.15 kilometres long and 18.18 metres wide. It has 41 spans on 42 pillars. The cost of the mega project is Tk. 30,193.39 crore. This mega project is being funded from the own resources of the government of Bangladesh. It is a truss bridge and the material of the bridge is steel. The bridge has increased connectivity beyond the boundary. It has established direct road communication between Dhaka and the southern parts of the country. It has opened up huge possibilities in the tourism (পর্যটন) sectors in Bangladesh. Traders can take their goods directly to the capital. They can make profit by supplying their fresh products to the buyers. The bridge has cut the travel time between Dhaka and Mongla Port. It will reduce overall poverty and contribute to industrial development, regional trade, agricultural expansion, etc. Soon after its inauguration of the Padma Bridge by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on 25 June 2022.15,200 vehicles cross it in the first 8 hours. A total of 24000 vehicles cross the Padma Bridge every day. The bridge has ensured the increase of GDP growth rate by more than 1%. Due to poor connectivity economic operation in the south-western zone has not been too easy. Consequently (অতএব), the districts did not seize much industrialization (শিল্পায়ন). As a result, poverty and unemployment constitute major problem in this region. However, the Padma Bridge will offer many advantages to the region. It will unveil the door of opportunity for industrialization which will remove unemployment problem."

          "explanation": "Causes and Effects of Unemployment in Bangladesh\nUnemployment refers to the state of a person, capable of working, unable to find a paid job. In Bangladesh, unemployment still remains as one of the significant challenges. In order to address this issue hindering economic growth, the causes of unemployment need to be explored first. Rapid population growth is a major factor behind the unemployment rate. In comparison to the population, there are not enough job opportunities in the market. So, when a fresh graduate or anyone from the working-age enters the job market, the competition is quite fierce for a single seat. On the other hand, due to the digitalization of the country, laborers are being replaced with machines in the work field. Although automation helps businesses by improving its productivity and accuracy, it leaves a gap in the job market by reducing job opportunities. Lack of proper training and workoriented education are some of the other contributing factors regarding unemployment. The effect of unemployment falls directly on the economy of the country. Without a source of an income, unemployed people fail to provide themselves and their families with basic necessities. As a result, their standard of living meets no improvement. The pressure of finding a job and affording expenses collectively may cause extreme mental health issues for the people involved. It is a serious issue that the government cannot fix alone; we should all come forward to build a better nation by reducing unemployment in the country."
