          "explanation": "The Advantages of Rural Life\nRural life means village life. It has two major advantages. The main feature of rural life is peacefulness and the other is naturalness. Life in a village, is calm and quiet and uneventful (গতানুগতিক). Villagers do not suffer from tension. In a village the air is free from pollution. In the village, one gets fresh air, vegetables, fruits and fish. One can swim and walk without fear of accidents as in the city. These are not available in urban life and this makes the rural life different from the urban life. Although electricity has reached many villages, most of the urban amenities (সুযোগ-সুবিধা) are still absent. But the environment in rural life is fresh and clean and the people are friendly and.generous. In rural life, people lead a much simpler life close to nature. The farmers who are the core factors of agriculture live in villages. They produce rice and other crops working from the early morning till evening. One can get pure water, presh fruits, vegetables, fish, milk and meat in villages. Rural life is free from the din and bustle of city life. The pollution levels are much lower and social values still prevail (বিরাজ ক্করা) in rural life. Rural life and urban life are totally different from each other. The status of rural life can be developed by the way of increasing the infrastructural facilities as well as employment opportunities."
