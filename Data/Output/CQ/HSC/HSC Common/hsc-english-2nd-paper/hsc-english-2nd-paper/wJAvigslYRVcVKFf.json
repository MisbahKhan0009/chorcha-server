Early in the morning, we gathered at our college and started our journey by bus. There were almost 300 students, and fifteen teachers accompanied us. The journey was enjoyable as we sang songs, laughed, and admired the scenic views along the way. When we reached the park, we were amazed by its colorful rides, green gardens, and a big lake. We first explored the park and took many pictures. Then, we went on different rides like roller coasters and bumper cars. The water park was the most exiciting part. We played in the water and had a lot of fun. At lunchtime, we sat together and enjoyed a delicious meal. After lunch, we played group games. The whole day was filled with laughter and joy. In the evening, we took a final walk around the park and then started our return journey. We returned home feeling happy and refreshed, carrying many wonderful memories. It was truly an amazing picnic, and we will cherish the moments forever.\n"

          "explanation": "Unemployment Problem in Our Country\n\nWhen a man has a job or a work for his living, he is employed. And when he has no job, he is referred as unemployed. In a country, if there are more able people than the total number of jobs, there is an unemployment problem. Bangladesh is now seriously facing this problem. An unemployed person is generally either frustrated or an idle brain. Moreover, when they are not in any service, they hardly care anyone. There is a popular saying, \"An idle brain is the devil's workshop.\" Nowadays, the social disorder is mainly caused by unemployment. Hence, it is a great curse in our country.We can, however, change our condition by ourselves. The first thing that can be done is to control the high birth rate of our population. We all desire to work in cities. This tendency should be changed. We can engage ourselves in self-employment in our rural areas. In this context, the government should help the unemployed people with technical education and financial support. The government should increase facilities in the field of technology. Moreover, the guardians of the society can help their children most. They can help them with good advice and guidance.\n"
