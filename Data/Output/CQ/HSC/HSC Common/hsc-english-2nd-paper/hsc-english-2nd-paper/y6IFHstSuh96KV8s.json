I am writing on behalf of the students of our esteemed institution to draw your attention to an issue that has been a significant concern for us.\nIt has come to our notice that numerous outsiders frequently enter our college premises during class hours. Not only do they loiter around, but many of them also engage in disturbing activities such as loud conversations, playing music, and sometimes even involve in verbal confrontations. Their presence and activities are very distracting and create an uncomfortable environment for both students and teachers. It is hindering our academic focus and causing distress to many.\nUnderstanding that our college stands as a beacon of academic excellence in Jashore, it is imperative that we maintain its decorum and safeguard its sanctity from unnecessary disturbances. Therefore, I kindly request you to take stringent measures to prevent unauthorized entry into the college. Possible solutions can be:\n1. Increasing security personnel at all entrances. 2. Introducing and enforcing a strict ID card policy. 3. Setting up barriers or gates that restrict entry without verification. 4. Raising awareness among students to report any unauthorized person they spot.\nWe believe that under your able guidance and administration, this issue will be addressed promptly. Our college campus should be a place of learning and growth, free from any disturbances, and we are confident that you will take the necessary steps to ensure this.\nThank you for your understanding and prompt attention to this matter.\nYours sincerely,\n[Your Name] [Class/Section]"

          "explanation": "The International Mother Language Day\nMother language means a language through which the people of a country express their ideas, thoughts, feelings and emotions clearly. The 21st February is the International Mother Language Day. In order to show due honour and respect to the existing mother languages of different countries, the day has been declared as International Mother Language Day by UNESCO. In reply to a proposal from Bangladesh Govt., the declaration has come to reality. The day has a long glorious historical background (পটতৃমি). It is a matter of great regret that the then rulers of Pakistan tried to impose \"Urdu' as the state language upon us instead of Bangla. Before the independence of our country in 1952, the then Pakistani ruler Jinnah declared in the public meeting that \"Urdu and only Urdu shall be the state language of Pakistan.\". The people of our country burst into (ফ্টে পড়া) protest against this unjustified decision. Some of the heroic sons of this soil came forward and sacrificed their valuable lives for the cause of the mother tongue on the 21 st February. 1952. The objective of observing the day is to pay homage to the language martyrs. The day is greatly important for the people of Bangladesh. Now, it is a matter of great pleasure and prestige that this day got international recognition (ন্বীकৃতি) in 1999 as International Mother Language Day."

          "explanation": "Impact of Climate Change in Bangladesh\nLong-term variation in temperatures and weather patterns is known as climate change. The frequent\nshift of climate in Bangladesh has been showing a number of devastating effects, such as, rising sea level, floods and intensifying cyclones, Firstly, Rising sea level is a growing threat to people all around Bangladesh. To illustrate, Two-thirds of the land of this country is less than fifteen feet above sea level. So, the increase of sea level might cause extinction of huge low land area, Respondingly, The dwellers of the area may have to migrate from their own land. Secondly, Climate change is making rainfall more erratic and often far more intense. In terms of Bangladesh, this reality has recently become quite evident, Because of irregular rain and melting the Himalayan glaciers, Bangladesh is now far more vulnerable to devastating floods, Lastly and more importantly, The Bay of Bangal narrows towards its northern shore where it meets the south of coast Bangladesh. This narrowing can both direct cyclones towards Bangladesh's coast and make them more intense. To conclude, to minimize climate change, some immediate steps could be taken such as planting more trees, reducing the use of CFC gases, using electric vehicles, recycling plastic materials, In a word, People should practice eco-friendly behaviors to protect the nature as well as themselves.\n\n"
