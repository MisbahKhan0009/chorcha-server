For many different reasons, English has achieved the prestige of being that language. As a result, it has crossed national borders to reach people who speak other languages. It is no longer the unique possession of British or American people, but a language that belongs to the world's people. In fact, bilingual and multilingual users of English far outnumber its monolingual native speakers. This phenomenon has led to a bewildering variety of English around the world. As more and more people speak English, more and more varieties have emerged which are strongly influenced by the pronunciation, grammar and idioms of the respective mother tongues. World English has now moved away from the control of the native speakers. However, the question of British or American English is not so important now. Today's slogan is mutual intelligibility among users of the language.\n\n(a) obviously (synonym); (b) obviously (antonym); (c) prestige (synonym); (d) phenomenon (synonym); (e) unique (antonym); (f) belong (synonym); (g) outnumber (synonym); (h) monolingual (antonym); (i) native (antonym); (j) variety (synonym); (k) emerge (antonym); (l) control (antonym) (m) bewildering (synonym); (n) intelligibility (antonym).",

As a student of [Your Course/Department] at X College, I am writing to bring to your attention a proposal that I believe will significantly enhance the learning experience for all students: the introduction of multimedia facilities in classrooms.\nIn today's digital age, traditional teaching methods are being complemented, and in many cases replaced, by interactive and multimedia-based learning techniques. The integration of multimedia resources such as projectors, smart boards, and audiovisual equipment can greatly enrich the educational experience by making lessons more engaging, interactive, and accessible to diverse learning styles.\nMultimedia facilities in classrooms would enable instructors to incorporate a variety of teaching aids such as educational videos, interactive presentations, and digital simulations into their lectures. This would not only capture the attention of students but also facilitate better understanding and retention of complex concepts.\nMoreover, multimedia facilities can accommodate different learning preferences and cater to the needs of students with varying abilities, ensuring a more inclusive learning environment. Additionally, the use of multimedia technology fosters creativity and critical thinking skills among students by encouraging them to explore, analyze, and synthesize information in innovative ways.\nI believe that the introduction of multimedia facilities in classrooms aligns with X College's commitment to providing quality education and preparing students for success in a rapidly evolving world. Therefore, I urge you to consider this proposal favorably and take the necessary steps to implement multimedia facilities in our college classrooms.\nThank you for considering my suggestion. I am confident that this initiative will greatly benefit the academic community at X College and contribute to the overall enhancement of our educational experience.\nYours sincerely,\n[Your Name] [Your Course/Department] [Your Roll/ID Number]"

          "explanation": "Our National Flag\nA national flag is the symbol of a nation's sovereignty and independent identity. It introduces the country to the whole world. Every independent country has a national flag of its own. We have our own national flag. Our national flag is the greatest achievement in our national life. It is our pride and glory. In 1971, we achieved a new independent country named Bangladesh and her flag. Our flag is green with a red circle at the centre. The green colour symbolizes the peaceful youthfullness of this green country, and the red circle symbolizes the sun of freedom. The proportion of the length and breadth of our flag is 10 : 6 10: 6 10 : 6 and the radius of the red sun is one fifth of its length. The designer of our national flag is Quamrul Hassan. On our government office buildings, the national flag is hoisted. Bangladesh High Commissions in other countries also hoist the national flag. Our country's flag is also hoisted in the UN. Our army personnel, on duty in peace-keeping missions in foreign countries bear the flag. Our President, Prime Minister and other Ministers move in flagged cars. We are determined to keep its honour high at any cost.\n"

          "explanation": "Living in a Nuclear Family and an Extended Family\nI live in an extended family. Despite having some problems, I am happy. But nowadays, nuclear families are increasing in numbers. Our life has become very busy. At the same time, being bound to live in cities in search of income, people have become detached from their parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts and cousins. They live in cities with their wives and children only. But life in cities is not so easy nowadays. So, with the gradual increase of the price of daily commodities, they cannot send money to the extended families in villages. In a nuclear family, children can grow up in a suitable environment. There they are brought up soundly. But in reality, the children in a nuclear family feel lonely. They cannot share their feelings with others. Their parents remain busy most of the time. So, they become mentally upset. Human mind is very sensitive. So, everyone wants to have someone to share one's distress and happiness. I don't support a nuclear family, because in it, family members become self- centered in most cases. It is, in fact, a reality of modern life that people become bound to form a nuclear family in the long distant cities."
