In markets there is hardly any food item which is not adulterated. Fruits, vegetables, fishes, milk and milk products among others are severely adulterated in markets all over Bangladesh. A recent survey conducted in different areas of Dhaka City shows that about half of the 82 samples of fish, vegetables, milk and milk products have been found adulterated with DDT, Aldrin and other poisonous chemicals. There are some definite reasons behind food adulteration. For example , the people who are responsible to check adulteration are not serious in their duties. Besides, chemicals like formalin are easily available to dishonest people. And the most striking reason is greed along with lack of consciousness. Some dishonest people want to make unbridled profit through the unfair ways of food adulteration.\n(a) adulteration (synonym); (b) problems (antonym); (c) hardly (synonym); (d) severely (antonym); (e) recent (synonym); (f) conducted (synonym); (g) poisonous (antonym); (h) definite (antonym); (i) example (synonym); (j) responsible (antonym); (k) serious (synonym); (1) available (antonym); (m) greed (antonym); (n) unbridled (synonym).",

          "explanation": "The International Mother Language Day\nMother language means a language through which the people of a country express their ideas, thoughts, feelings and emotions clearly. The 21st February is the International Mother Language Day. In order to show due honour and respect to the existing mother languages of different countries, the day has been declared as International Mother Language Day by UNESCO. In reply to a proposal from Bangladesh Govt., the declaration has come to reality. The day has a long glorious historical background (পটতৃমি). It is a matter of great regret that the then rulers of Pakistan tried to impose \"Urdu' as the state language upon us instead of Bangla. Before the independence of our country in 1952, the then Pakistani ruler Jinnah declared in the public meeting that \"Urdu and only Urdu shall be the state language of Pakistan.\". The people of our country burst into (ফ্টে পড়া) protest against this unjustified decision. Some of the heroic sons of this soil came forward and sacrificed their valuable lives for the cause of the mother tongue on the 21 st February. 1952. The objective of observing the day is to pay homage to the language martyrs. The day is greatly important for the people of Bangladesh. Now, it is a matter of great pleasure and prestige that this day got international recognition (ন্বীकৃতি) in 1999 as International Mother Language Day."

          "explanation": "Road Accidents in Bangladesh\nRoad accidents in Bangladesh have become a grave concern over recent years, claiming numerous lives and causing severe injuries. The causes are multifaceted, ranging from poor road conditions, faulty vehicles, to human negligence. Overcrowded streets, coupled with a lack of proper traffic management, frequently result in chaos and collisions. Many drivers, especially of public transport, lack proper training and often drive recklessly to meet tight schedules or to get more passengers. Furthermore, pedestrians, sometimes without adequate infrastructure like zebra crossings or foot-over bridges, risk their lives while crossing roads.\nThe effects of these accidents are devastating. Besides the immediate loss of life and injuries, families often lose their primary breadwinners, pushing them into financial hardships. The injured, if they survive, might endure long-term disabilities, leading to lost livelihoods and an increased burden on families and the healthcare system. Additionally, the nation faces economic losses due to damaged vehicles and infrastructure, as well as reduced productivity from the injured or deceased.\nIn conclusion, road accidents in Bangladesh are a critical issue that requires immediate and comprehensive interventions. Addressing infrastructure, ensuring proper training for drivers, and raising public awareness can go a long way in reducing this menace."
