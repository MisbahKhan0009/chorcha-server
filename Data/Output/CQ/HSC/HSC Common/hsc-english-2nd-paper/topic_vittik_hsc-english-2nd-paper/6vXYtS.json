There are some definite reasons behind food adulteration. For example , the people who are responsible to check adulteration are not serious in their duties.

Thus, if that officer dies in a crash, it's said, darkly, that they bought the farm.

That plane crash, then, indirectly bought the farm for the farmer.

I am writing to you, on behalf of the students of Dhaka College, to propose the establishment of an English Language Club within the college premises.\nAs a second-year college student, I have observed a growing interest among my peers in improving their English language skills. However, we feel that our current academic curriculum may not adequately cater to the practical aspects of language learning, such as speaking and listening proficiency.\nThe proposed English Language Club would serve as a platform for students to enhance their English language abilities through various interactive activities, such as debates, discussions, public speaking sessions, and language games. Additionally, the club could organize workshops, seminars, and guest lectures by language experts to provide valuable insights and guidance.\nMoreover, the English Language Club would foster a sense of camaraderie among students with a shared interest in language learning, promoting cultural exchange and mutual support.\nWe believe that the establishment of an English Language Club would complement our academic endeavors and contribute to our personal and professional development. Therefore, we earnestly request your support and approval for this initiative.\nThank you for considering our proposal. We look forward to your positive response and guidance on how to proceed further with this endeavor.\nSincerely,\nMotin\n[Your Signature]"

They often taunt and tease college going youths especially the girls, hijack various vehicles, cheat the shopkeepers, give no fare to the rickshaw pullers and behave roughly towards people and passers-by (পথচারী). Things turn worse after the sunset. They gather at the intersections (মোড়) of roads and footpaths to take narcotics such as hashish, phensidyl , soporific drugs and heroin. They sell various unauthorized things like forbidden drugs, illegal weapons, etc. here and there. Then they prey on passers-by and snatch away their belongings. Some people have been stabbed (ছুরি আঘাত) and some others have been compelled to give them extortions. They have even threatened some persons with killing. So, we are' all living in a frustrating (হতাশাগ্রস্থ) situation with a premonition (পূর্বজ্ঞান) that conditions may deteriorate further.\nCommunity leaders and elderly citizens have tried to persuade them to come back to sense and stop bullying (গুন্ডামি) people.

The integration of multimedia resources such as projectors, smart boards, and audiovisual equipment can greatly enrich the educational experience by making lessons more engaging, interactive, and accessible to diverse learning styles.\nMultimedia facilities in classrooms would enable instructors to incorporate a variety of teaching aids such as educational videos, interactive presentations, and digital simulations into their lectures. This would not only capture the attention of students but also facilitate better understanding and retention of complex concepts.\nMoreover, multimedia facilities can accommodate different learning preferences and cater to the needs of students with varying abilities, ensuring a more inclusive learning environment. Additionally, the use of multimedia technology fosters creativity and critical thinking skills among students by encouraging them to explore, analyze, and synthesize information in innovative ways.\nI believe that the introduction of multimedia facilities in classrooms aligns with X College's commitment to providing quality education and preparing students for success in a rapidly evolving world. Therefore, I urge you to consider this proposal favorably and take the necessary steps to implement multimedia facilities in our college classrooms.\nThank you for considering my suggestion.

          "explanation": "The Impact of Facebook on the Young Generation\nIn the digital age, social media platforms have become an integral part of the daily lives of millions worldwide. Among these, Facebook stands out as one of the most prominent and influential platforms, especially among the young generation. However, the impact of Facebook on today's youth is a subject of ongoing debate, with both positive and negative effects being observed.\nPositive Influence:\nFacebook has undoubtedly revolutionized the way young people communicate, connect, and share information. It serves as a virtual social hub, enabling users to stay connected with friends and family, regardless of geographical distances. Through Facebook, young individuals can maintain relationships, share updates about their lives, and express themselves creatively through photos, videos, and posts.\nMoreover, Facebook facilitates networking and provides opportunities for socialization. Many young people use Facebook to join groups and communities based on shared interests, hobbies, or causes. These online communities offer a sense of belonging and camaraderie, fostering friendships and collaborations that transcend physical boundaries.\nAdditionally, Facebook has emerged as a powerful platform for learning and awareness. It provides access to a vast repository of information, news, and educational resources. Young users can engage with informative content, participate in discussions, and broaden their perspectives on various issues.\nNegative Influence:\nDespite its many benefits, Facebook also exerts several negative influences on the young generation. One of the primary concerns is the impact on mental health. Excessive use of Facebook has been linked to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety among young users. The constant exposure to curated versions of others' lives on social media can lead to unrealistic comparisons and feelings of inadequacy.\nFurthermore, Facebook can be a breeding ground for cyberbullying and online harassment. Young people may face peer pressure, criticism, or harassment from their peers, which can have detrimental effects on their self-esteem and well-being.\nAnother significant issue associated with Facebook is its potential for addiction. The platform's addictive features, such as likes, comments, and notifications, can lead to compulsive usage patterns, detracting from real-world interactions and productivity.\nMoreover, concerns have been raised about the impact of Facebook on privacy and data security. Young users may unknowingly expose personal information or fall victim to online scams and phishing attacks, posing risks to their safety and security.\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, Facebook wields a profound influence on the young generation, shaping their social interactions, behaviors, and perceptions. While it offers numerous benefits in terms of connectivity, information sharing, and community building, it also poses challenges related to mental health, privacy, and online safety. Therefore, it is imperative for young users, parents, educators, and policymakers to recognize the dual nature of Facebook's impact and work towards promoting responsible and mindful usage of social media platforms."

          "explanation": "Corruption in Bangladesh: A Menace to Progress\nCorruption remains a pervasive and entrenched issue in Bangladesh, undermining the country's progress and development efforts. Despite ongoing efforts to combat it, corruption continues to permeate various sectors, including politics, bureaucracy, law enforcement, and business.\nPolitical corruption, characterized by bribery, embezzlement, and abuse of power, is particularly rampant. Politically connected individuals often use their influence to secure lucrative government contracts, evade taxes, and manipulate public resources for personal gain. This not only erodes public trust in the government but also perpetuates a culture of impunity and inequality.\nFurthermore, corruption within the bureaucracy hampers the delivery of essential services and obstructs the implementation of development projects. Bureaucrats, often motivated by personal interests rather than public welfare, engage in bribery and nepotism, leading to inefficiency, delays, and mismanagement of resources.\nIn the realm of law enforcement, corruption undermines the rule of law and weakens the criminal justice system. Police officers, judges, and other law enforcement officials frequently engage in extortion, bribery, and collusion with criminal elements, compromising the integrity of investigations and judicial proceedings.\nMoreover, corruption poses a significant obstacle to economic growth and investment. Business owners and entrepreneurs face extortion and bribery demands at various levels, hindering their ability to operate transparently and competitively. Foreign investors are deterred by the perception of corruption, resulting in reduced foreign direct investment and economic stagnation.\nAddressing corruption requires a comprehensive approach that includes strengthening anti-corruption laws, enhancing transparency and accountability mechanisms, and promoting ethical leadership at all levels of society. Additionally, raising public awareness about the detrimental effects of corruption and empowering civil society to hold authorities accountable are crucial steps towards building a more just and equitable society.\nIn conclusion, corruption poses a formidable challenge to Bangladesh's development aspirations, threatening the country's stability, prosperity, and democratic values. Urgent and concerted efforts are needed to root out corruption and foster a culture of integrity, accountability, and good governance in Bangladesh."

          "explanation": "the Rohingya camps at Teknaf in Cox's Bazar.\n\nFollowing the largest-ever influx of Rohingyas in August 2017, at least 76 criminal cases on various charges were filed against the members of the community in the last quarter of the year.\n\nIn the first seven months of this year, 178 cases have already been filed against Rohingyas.But law enforcers claim this is just the tip of the iceberg, as a large number of crimes -- including murder, abduction, and sexual harassment -- that take place inside the camps go unreported.\n\"We receive at least 10 to 12 complaints daily, including of murder, from the Rohingya camps but we fail to take any action as the Rohingyas are not interested to file any cases,\" said Md Hemayetul Islam, commanding officer of Armed Police Battalion (APBn-16).\nHemayetul said they received a complaint that a Rohingya man killed his wife last week but they failed to take any action as the victim's family did not want to register a case.The majority of the Rohingyas are not officially recognised as refugees by the Bangladesh government -- meaning they have no legal rights in the country and that's why filing a case can be daunting.\n\"They hold internal meetings led by majhis [Rohingya leaders assigned to help maintain order in the camps] and just perform the burial [of the victim],\" he told The Daily Star last week.\nShalish-style informal justice mechanisms led by majhis take place in many cases and do not reach the police or even the camp in-charge.On August 21, a Rohingya \"criminal group\" suddenly came out from the hills and started firing at Unchiprang camp 22. As law enforcers started gathering in the camp, the \"criminal group\" again went into hiding after firing 15 to 20 rounds, according to sources.\nDuring the firing, two Rohingya men -- Block C residents Shukur, 20, and Nur Hossain, 45 -- suffered bullet injuries and needed treatment.\nHowever, no case has yet been registered with the police.\nOn Tuesday, police arrested six Rohingya men in possession of arms following a raid at a refugee camp in Teknaf.  The arrestees are Nur Hossain, Mohammad Alam, Abdur Rahman, Abu Sadek, Md Amin and Jafor Alam -- all living in Wykong Puthibonia Rohingya Refugee Camp.Two pistols, seven bullets and machetes were recovered from their possession, said Anwar Hossain, camp-in-charge of APBn.\n\"Some unruly Rohingya men were trying to establish supremacy in the Rohingya camp by creating chaos,\" he said, adding that they fired blanks to create panic.\nA case was, however, filed in this connection.\nDue to crime incidents such as these, locals living in Teknaf and Ukhia -- where the camps are located -- have expressed concerns over their safety.\nJahangir Kabir Chowdhury, chairman of Rajapalong union parishad, told The Daily Star on Thursday, \"We are in fear as they [Rohingyas] are organised and they are gradually spreading to various parts of the district.\n\"We often find thousands of Rohingyas moving outside the camps. If they attack us, then who will protect us from them?\"\nThe government does not permit Rohingyas to move freely outside the camps -- though this has been unevenly enforced over the years, restrictions have tightened recently.\nABM Masud Hossain, superintendent of police of Cox's Bazar, told The Daily Star that they have two special battalions (APBn-14 and APBn-16) to oversee law and order in the camps.\n\"We only investigate the cases filed with police stations. Still, we are on alert and take action whenever any specific information reaches us,\" he added.\nMAJOR CRIMES\nPolice and local sources said crimes inside the refugee camps mainly take place over sexual harassment cases, including rape and that related to extramarital affairs, narcotics smuggling, and hundi.\nA high ranking police official who works inside the camps said many Rohingyas living in other countries send money to their families in Bangladesh.\n\"But they mainly send money through hundi as they have no direct account service. The receiver sometimes does not pay the full amount to the family after receiving the money,\" he said.\nFor this reason, cheated family members often hire local criminal groups to abduct the person and take them away in the hilly areas and hold them there until they give up the rest of the money, said the official.\nAccording to the police database, nine abduction cases were registered against 39 Rohingyas in 2018, six cases against 40 Rohingyas in 2019, and one against three Rohingyas so far this year.\nBesides, some members of the Rohingya community often get locked in clashes -- sometimes fatal -- over narcotics smuggling, claimed several police sources.\nThe police database shows 22 narcotics cases filed in 2017, which jumped to 95 cases in 2018, 152 cases in 2019, and 136 cases in the first seven months of this year.\nLt Col Ali Haidar Azad Ahmed, commanding officer of 34 Border Guard Bangladesh Battalion, told The Daily Star on Friday, \"Total control of the yaba trade has gone into the hands of the Rohingya. They now have investors and carriers inside the camps.\n\"They have their syndicate members on the other side of the border [Myanmar]. Through the syndicates, they smuggle yaba inside the camps.\"\nAccording to the database, around 67 Rohingyas were killed in gunfights with law enforcers in the last two years for their alleged involvement in narcotics smuggling and robbery.\nFrom January 1 to August 20 this year, the 34 BGB battalion has recovered around 14.20 lakh yaba tablets and detained some 21 Rohingyas in relation.\nHemayetul Islam, CO of APBn-16, said that they are working closely to address the crimes and ensure security but often face difficulties as they have no outpost inside the camps.\n\"We have already held meetings several times with the Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner and placed requisitions for an outpost and vehicles to ensure full-fledged security in the camps,\" he said.\nOnce an outpost is installed and police can stay inside the camps around the clock, then they will be able to monitor activities closely and address these issues, he added.\nUNAUTHORISED SHOPS, INFORMAL WORK\nAccording to sources, there are around  10,000 unauthorised shops inside the Rohingya camps.\nThese sell daily essentials such as vegetables and meat, as well as more luxurious products such as electronics and gold ornaments.\nThese shops, run without trade licenses and which do not pay tax, are owned by locals and Rohingya leaders such as majhis who collect tolls. Clashes often ensue inside the camps when extortionists harass shop owners, according to locals and police sources.\nBazlur Rahman, head majhi of camp 26, told The Daily Star on Friday that they have learned about the involvement of some majhis in yaba smuggling and collecting tolls with criminal groups.\n\"We are working with law enforcers and the local administration to address the situation and make the camps crime-free,\" he added.\nRohingyas are also hired by locals to work outside the camps -- mostly as day labourers in the fields or as domestic help.\nDuring a visit to the Cox's Bazar area, this correspondent met a local who claimed that he would be able to provide Rohingya domestic help \"of any age\".\nHe said, depending on the employer, he charged between Tk 2,000 and Tk 5,000 for this service.\nRohingya men also work as day labourers in various parts of Cox's Bazar district.\nEvery morning, they go out of the camps for work and come back in the evening, claimed a district ruling party leader, requesting anonymity.\nMohammad Shamsuddoza, additional refugee relief and repatriation commissioner, told The Daily Star on Sunday that the number of crimes reported is high because there is close monitoring but the situation is actually not that bad in the camps.\n\"Still, we are holding meetings with law enforcers regularly and asked them to take control so that not a single incident is reported from the camps,\" he said.\n\"We have also taken steps to ensure APBn requirements that they placed for duty in camps and it is already under process,\" said Shamsuddoza.\nRegarding the unauthorised shops and movement and work outside the camps, Shamsuddoza said all law enforcement -- police, APBn, Rapid Action Battalion, and the NSI -- are working to address the issues.\n[Our Cox's Bazar correspondent Mohammad Ali Jinnat contributed to the report]"

          "explanation": "Food Adulteration\n\nIt is matter of great concern of all that unsafe food serves as a growth medium for bacteria that can cause food poisoning.Foodborne diseases may turn fatal and even cause death. There is lead in turmeric, formalin in fish, fruits, vegetables and milk. High concentration of pesticides and chemical preservatives are found in fresh produces. Studies show that farmers use a concoction of toxic chemicals to fight pests and they indiscriminately use chemicals in crops to extend shelf life without showing any concern for the health of consumers. We also know of contamination by microorganisms leading to acute food poisoning. Food safety is a scientific discipline involving safe production, handling, preparation and storage of food in ways that prevent contamination and growth of bacteria. It is done to prevent foodborne diseases. Therefore, it is the responsibility of those who handle and prepare food commercially and at the same time of consumers to ensure the food is safe for consumption.Contaminated foods can carry harmful contaminants,chemicals, parasites and toxins. Application of excessive and unauthorised additives and colours for making food items tasty and attractive can be lethal as many such chemicals may cause cancer and other life threatening ailments. Millions of people of our country become ill from foodborne pathogens each year.On the basis of a surveydone from 2010 to 2013,the Public Health Institute stated that 50%of all food items were found to be adulterated.Greed for fast profit among food traders has led to today's alarming situation. Poisonous residues in food items leave the worst impact on children's mental and physical growth and women's reproductive system including fertility. They cause cancer and damage vital human organs like liver,kidney and heart. Frequent reuse of oil in cooking food items release carcinogenic materials which may lead to cancer.Now a days, formalin is one of the burning topics of discussion.Though many food items contain naturally occurring  formaldehyde but that level is permissible for human consumption. When formaldehyde is found in excess amount it becomes a source of health concern. Formalin applied on fish,fruit,meat and milk causes cancer,childhood asthma,skin disease etc.So the government monitoring agencies must ensure judicious use of formalin in food items.The relevant government agencies for food safety have a role to play in consumer protection. They need to educate producers on how to produce safe food, and at the same time punish people who deliberately sell unsafe food. The Bangladesh Food Safety Authority was incorporated in 2013 as an Act to help coordinate food control and consumer protection activities across the country. FAO is providing technical assistance to the Ministry of Food in this regard. But there is also the need for political will to devote sufficient public resources to make the system operational and effective in the longer term.\n\n"

The recent surge in incidents involving speeding, aggressive maneuvers, and disregard for traffic laws is not only endangering the lives of pedestrians and cyclists but also contributing to a pervasive sense of insecurity among residents.\nIt is distressing to witness the blatant disregard for safety exhibited by some motorists, who seem oblivious to the potential consequences of their actions. Pedestrian crossings are routinely ignored, red lights are treated as mere suggestions, and speeding through residential areas has become distressingly commonplace. Such reckless behavior not only poses a grave risk to public safety but also erodes the quality of life in our community.\nFurthermore, the inadequate enforcement of traffic regulations exacerbates the problem, emboldening reckless drivers to flout the law with impunity. I urge law enforcement authorities to step up efforts to enforce traffic laws rigorously and hold accountable those who engage in reckless driving practices.\nAs responsible members of society, it is our collective responsibility to prioritize safety on our roads and foster a culture of mutual respect and consideration among all road users. I implore fellow residents to exercise caution and restraint behind the wheel, mindful of the profound impact our actions can have on the well-being of others.\nIn conclusion, I appeal to policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and the community at large to collaborate in addressing this pressing issue and ensuring that our streets are safe for all. Together, we can work towards creating a more harmonious and secure environment for everyone.\nYours sincerely,\n[Your Name]"

Bangladesh has constructed the bridge with its own resources. It connects Loúhajong, Munshiganj to Shariatpur and Madaripur. Thus, it links the south-west of the country to northern and eastern regions. Actually, it has connected 21 southern districts with the capital. The bridge is a two-level steel truss bridge that carries a four-lane highway on the upper level and a singletrack railway on the lower level. Having 41 spans, each 150 m long and 204 steel piles and 32 vertical bored concrete piles, the bridge is 6.15 km long and 18.18 m wide. The rail viaduct has 14 spans of 332 m connecting Mawa end to Jajira end. Apart from transportation, there are other utilities like gas transmission line, optical fiber and telephone line and high voltage electric line through the bridge. The bridge has been constructed by China Railway Major Bridge Engineering Company Limited. The project has taken 1062 hectares of land. Starting on 7 December 2014, the construction ended in June 2022. This dream bridge was inaugurated on June 25, 2022 and was opened for vehicles the following day. The Padma Bridge is the most expensive project in the history of Bangladesh. However, the bridge will contribute a lot to the economic development of Bangladesh. It will increase the GDP by as much as 1.2 percent. Thus, the Padma Multipurpose Bridge is a huge milestone in the construction history of Bangladesh,"

The hike or spiral in essential commodities usually occurs where there is a huge demand of a particular commodity than its supply. But it is a regular phenomenon in our country. Prices of essentials continue to rise almost every day. The impacts of price hike are manifold. The poor and underprivileged people are the worst sufferers.

What we need to do at first is to control the price hike of essentials. For that, we must check the syndicated groups of greedy businessmen who mainly increase prices of commodities to make more profits. The government must take effective steps to grow more food.

          "explanation": "Indiscriminate Cutting of Trees\nThe indiscriminate cutting of trees, or deforestation, is one of the most serious environmental issues of our time. The primary causes behind this large-scale deforestation include rapid urbanization, industrial expansion, agricultural needs, and the increasing demand for wood as fuel and raw material. In developing countries, poverty also drives people to cut down trees for firewood or to clear land for cultivation. Moreover, illegal logging and weak enforcement of forest protection laws contribute significantly to the destruction of forest areas.\nThe effects of this reckless deforestation are devastating. It disrupts the natural balance of the environment by reducing biodiversity, destroying animal habitats, and leading to the extinction of many species. One of the most alarming consequences is climate change. Trees absorb carbon dioxide, and their removal increases the concentration of greenhouse gases, leading to global warming. Deforestation also causes soil erosion, frequent floods, and droughts by disturbing the natural water cycle. Furthermore, the loss of green cover reduces the oxygen level in the air, making the environment less healthy for living beings.\nIn conclusion, the indiscriminate cutting of trees is a self-destructive act that threatens ecological balance. Urgent action is needed to protect forests and promote sustainable living for the sake of future generations."

There are several causes behind road accidents. One of the most common reasons is reckless or careless driving, including speeding, overtaking, and ignoring traffic signals. Drunk driving, using mobile phones while driving, and driving without proper training also contribute heavily to road mishaps. Poor road conditions, lack of street lights, and absence of proper traffic management systems further increase the risk. In some cases, mechanical failure of vehicles can also lead to serious accidents.\nThe effects of road accidents are often devastating. They cause loss of lives, permanent injuries, and emotional trauma to victims and their families. Many people lose their ability to work, which leads to financial difficulties. Accidents also cause damage to vehicles and public property, increasing repair and medical costs. On a larger scale, they create traffic jams and reduce the overall efficiency of transportation systems.\nTo reduce road accidents, strict traffic rules must be enforced, roads should be maintained properly, and drivers must be educated about safe driving practices. Public awareness and responsible behavior on the road are essential to ensure safety for all."

It was the core inspiration of our liberation war During the speech, Bangabandhu declared in a thunderous voice that \"The struggle, this time, is for our freedom; the fight, this time, is for our independence.\" It was delivered during a period of escalating tensions between East (now Bangladesh) and West Pakistan. Pakistani military rulers refused to transfer the power to Bangabandhu, whose party Awami League gained the majority by winning 167 of the 169 seats allotted to East Pakistan and a majority of the 313 seats in the National Assembly in the general election of 1970. The Bangalees were already in destitute due to the economic favoritism practiced by the West Pakistani rulers for 23 years. The speech inspired them to prepare for a war of independence amid widespread reports of armed mobilisation by West Pakistan. The Bangladesh Liberation War began 18 days later, when the Pakistan Army launched Operation Searchlight against Bengali civilians, intellectuals, students and politicians.

It also serves as a platform for sharing knowledge, news, and educational content, making learning more accessible. Businesses use social media for marketing, reaching customers, and building their brands. Additionally, social media helps raise awareness about social, political, and environmental issues, encouraging public participation and activism.\nHowever, social media also has its abuses. Excessive use can lead to addiction, negatively affecting mental health and productivity. Many people face cyberbullying, harassment, and privacy violations on these platforms. The spread of misinformation and fake news is a serious problem that can cause confusion and panic. People often compare themselves to unrealistic portrayals of others’ lives, leading to low self-esteem and anxiety. Moreover, social media can distract individuals from real-life relationships and responsibilities, reducing face-to-face interactions.\nIn conclusion, while social media offers many advantages, it must be used responsibly. Awareness, self-discipline, and digital literacy are essential to minimize its abuses and maximize its benefits for society."

          "explanation": "Gender Discrimination\nGender discrimination is a serious social problem that affects individuals and societies across the world. It refers to the unequal treatment of people based on their gender, most often seen in the form of discrimination against women and girls. In many countries, especially in developing nations like Bangladesh, gender discrimination begins at birth. Girls are often considered a burden, denied equal access to education, nutrition, and healthcare. As they grow older, they face limited job opportunities, unequal pay, and lack of representation in leadership roles. Even within households, women are expected to take on unpaid domestic work, while their contributions go unrecognized. Men, on the other hand, are pressured to conform to traditional notions of masculinity, which also limits their freedom of expression. This imbalance creates a cycle of inequality and injustice. Gender discrimination not only hinders personal development but also slows national progress. A society cannot prosper by excluding half of its population from equal rights and opportunities. To combat this issue, awareness must be raised, and equal laws and policies must be implemented and enforced. True development is only possible when both men and women are treated equally in all spheres of life. Gender equality ensures justice, dignity, and growth for all."

This crisis is not a new one in Bangladesh, rather it has been going on since long past. In fact, since the 1970s Rohingya refugees have been coming to Bangladesh from Myanmar. In the 1990 s 1990 \\mathrm{s} 1990 s , more than 2.50,000 resided in refugee camps in Bangladesh. In the early 2000 s, all but 20,000 of them were repatriated to Myanmar, some against 'their will. But unfortunately this respite (বিরাম) ended' in 2015 and by 2017, an estimated 3,00,000 to 5,00,000 Rohingya refugees were in Bangladesh: Most of the refugees are located along the Teknaf-Cox's Bazar Highway that is parallel to the Naf River marking the border between Bangladesh and Myanmar. Later on, the number of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh continues to increase because of the brutal (বর্বর) behaviour of the Myanmar Army towards them. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), more than 7,23,000 Rohingyas have fled to Bangladesh since 25 August 2017. But on 28 September 2018, at the 73rd United Nations General Assembly, Bangladesh Prime Minister Shelkh Hasina said, \"There are 1.1 million Rohingya refugees now in Bangladesh.\" This huge number of refugees is rare in any country of the world except Bangladesh. So, undoubtedly the refugee crisis has turned into a great crisis and at the same time, it informs the world people of the fact that Bangladesh, being a small country with a dense population, will not be able to feed a huge influx of Rohingya refugees in the days to come. At this moment, Bangladesh demands a permanent solution so that a huge number of Rohingya people can go back to their native country, that is the only way of Bangladesh to get rid of refugee crisis. In this regard, Bangladesh has to strengthen her diplomatic activities involving, especially, the UN and her powerful neighbouring countries.\n"

There are several causes behind this growing issue. One major cause is frustration due to unemployment, family problems, and social pressure. Many young people fall into addiction as an escape from stress, failure, or emotional pain. Peer pressure and curiosity also play a big role in leading teenagers toward drugs. In urban areas, easy availability of drugs such as yaba, heroin, and phensedyl worsens the situation. Lack of awareness and proper guidance from families and educational institutions also contributes to the spread of addiction.\nThe effects of drug addiction are extremely harmful to both individuals and society. Physically, it damages the health of the user, often leading to deadly diseases and even death. Mentally, it causes depression, anxiety, and loss of self-control. Socially, drug addicts may turn to crime, such as theft or violence, to support their habit. Families of addicts suffer from emotional and financial distress. Moreover, addiction lowers the productivity of the youth, weakening the overall development of the country.\nTo fight this problem, proper education, strong family support, and strict law enforcement are essential. Public awareness must also be raised to save the youth from this dangerous path.\n"

One major cause is excessive use, where individuals spend hours scrolling, often late into the night, disrupting sleep patterns. Comparison culture is another key factor—users frequently compare their lives with others' highlight reels, leading to feelings of inadequacy, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Cyberbullying and online harassment also contribute significantly, particularly among teenagers, causing emotional distress, depression, and social withdrawal. Additionally, the constant need for validation, such as likes and comments, makes self-worth dependent on virtual feedback, creating a cycle of anxiety and compulsive checking. The effects are profound: prolonged exposure can lead to isolation, reduced attention span, and addiction-like behaviors. Some individuals may even develop symptoms of depression, chronic loneliness, or social anxiety disorder. However, social media is not entirely negative—it can promote awareness, connection, and support when used mindfully. The key lies in moderation, digital literacy, and mental health awareness. Setting healthy boundaries and prioritizing real-life relationships can help individuals reclaim balance and protect their mental well-being in a digitally driven world."

It emerged from the longstanding political and cultural tensions between East and West Pakistan, exacerbated by economic disparities and linguistic differences. The people of East Pakistan, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and his Awami League, demanded greater autonomy and recognition of their Bengali identity. However, when the ruling establishment in West Pakistan refused to address their grievances, the situation escalated into a full-scale armed conflict. The brutal crackdown by the Pakistani military on civilians ignited widespread outrage and galvanized support for independence. With the aid of Indian intervention, Bangladesh emerged victorious after nine months of intense fighting, culminating in the surrender of the Pakistani forces on December 16, 1971. The conflict resulted in the birth of Bangladesh as an independent nation, marking a triumph of the human spirit over oppression and a testament to the power of unity and determination in the face of adversity."

There are some obvious reasons for brain drain. The first and foremost reason is the lack of scope for higher education. As many brilliant students do not get good opportunities to receive higher education in our country, they are compelled to seek admission to foreign universities and colleges. As a result, they ultimately migrate to some foreign countries in order to receive higher education. Usually, some highly ambitious students who have sufficient financial support, migrate for higher education. After the completion of their higher education, they seek a good job and if they can manage one, they get settled there. They never think of returning home. This brain drain has a very negative impact on the socio-economic development of our country. Because of this, our country is deprived of the better services from many of her brilliant and talented people. In order to stop this brain drain, the authority should establish more universities to facilitate higher education. Apart from this, the students should be dutiful to their motherland and should not leave her for good."

But behind the stage, there are other people besides the performers and a few additional instrumentalists working on the production of the show. Usually there is a stage manager who looks over the entire operation. Under a stage manager's supervision, light and sound technicians work on their assigned jobs. There are also makeup artists helping the performers get ready before they appear on the stage. Laughter can be heard from somewhere and there would be performers encouraging one another. Sometimes dancers work on their last minute practices and singers work on warming their vocals. Although the stage welcomes one performer or a group of performers at a time, the backstage becomes a home to everyone involved. As a result, the environment cannot but get a little chaotic. Amidst the rush, every task is handled with caution. Everyone is focused on their specific task, so even if there is chaos, it is kept well under control. When it is about time for the show to commence, the stage manager assists the performers in getting on the stage within their designated slot. Tension, excitement and anticipation can be sensed in the air backstage as performers await their turn. Cultural expression comes to life on the stage through various performances with the assistance of a dedicated team working behind the scene. Once the show is over, the duty of the backstage is over as well."

Approximately 51% of girls marry before turning 18, the highest rate in South Asia and eighth highest globally (link.springer.com). Root causes are deeply woven into poverty , patriarchal norms , the dowry system , and concerns about girls’ safety. Poor rural families often perceive daughters as economic burdens and arrange early marriages to reduce expenses and dowry demands . Families also believe marriage offers security from premarital relationships or harassment .\nThe effects are profound: girls forced into early marriage frequently drop out of school, limiting their future opportunities (observerbd.com). Early pregnancy poses serious health risks—complications such as postpartum hemorrhage, high maternal and infant mortality, malnutrition, and anemia are common among teenage mothers (en.bonikbarta.com). Disrupted education also stunts girls’ personal and economic growth, reinforcing cycles of poverty and social inequality (observerbd.com). Additionally, early marriage increases vulnerability to intimate partner violence and limits young women’s agency in health and family decisions (link.springer.com).\nAddressing early marriage in Bangladesh requires a multifaceted approach: enforce laws like the Child Marriage Restraint Act more rigorously, improve girls’ access to education and economic resources, and drive cultural change through awareness campaigns targeting traditional norms ."

They encompass principles such as honesty, integrity, compassion, respect, responsibility, and fairness, which shape one's ethical framework and contribute to a harmonious society. The importance of moral values lies in their role in fostering positive relationships, both personal and professional, based on trust and mutual respect. They provide individuals with a moral compass, guiding them to make ethical decisions even in challenging circumstances. Moreover, moral values instill empathy and consideration for others, promoting a sense of community and social cohesion. In a world where diversity and differences abound, moral values serve as a universal language that transcends cultural, religious, and ideological boundaries, uniting people under common principles of decency and righteousness. Additionally, adherence to moral values fosters personal growth and self-discipline, leading to greater fulfillment and inner peace. Without moral values, societies risk descending into chaos and moral relativism, where self-interest prevails over the well-being of others. Therefore, nurturing and upholding moral values are essential for cultivating a just, compassionate, and civilized society where individuals thrive and flourish.\n"

In urban areas, people have a wide range of entertainment options. Cinemas, shopping malls, restaurants, parks, and internet cafes are common places where people spend their leisure time. The availability of television channels, streaming services, and social media also provides urban dwellers with diverse entertainment choices. Moreover, cultural events, concerts, and exhibitions are frequently organized in cities, offering opportunities for people to enjoy music, dance, and art.\nIn contrast, rural areas offer simpler forms of entertainment. Traditional folk music, village fairs, and community gatherings are popular. People often enjoy storytelling, playing local games, and participating in religious or seasonal festivals. The natural environment in villages provides opportunities for outdoor activities like fishing and farming-related recreation. However, limited access to modern technology and entertainment facilities restricts the variety of options available to rural residents.\nDespite these differences, both urban and rural entertainments are important for social bonding and relaxation. Urban entertainment tends to be more modern and diverse, while rural entertainment is rooted in tradition and community life. Each reflects the unique culture and lifestyle of its setting, showing how people find joy and leisure in different ways across Bangladesh."

          "explanation": "Democracy and Autocracy: A Comparison and Contrast\nDemocracy and autocracy are two fundamentally different systems of governance, each with its own principles, practices, and implications for citizens. In a democracy, power resides with the people. Citizens elect representatives through free and fair elections, and government decisions are made based on majority rule. Democratic systems value freedom of speech, press, and assembly, and they uphold human rights and the rule of law. The government is accountable to the public and can be changed through regular electoral processes.\nAutocracy, on the other hand, concentrates power in the hands of a single ruler or a small elite group. In this system, leaders are not chosen by the people, and their decisions are not subject to public approval or institutional checks. Political dissent is often suppressed, and civil liberties are limited. While an autocracy can deliver swift decision-making and maintain order without bureaucratic delays, it often does so at the cost of individual freedom and public participation.\nDespite their differences, both systems aim to establish governance and maintain stability. However, their approaches reflect contrasting values—democracy prioritizes participation, equality, and accountability, whereas autocracy emphasizes control, obedience, and centralized authority. Historically, democracies have been more successful in fostering innovation, protecting human rights, and promoting long-term social development, while autocracies have shown efficiency in crisis management and national mobilization.\nIn conclusion, the choice between democracy and autocracy shapes the relationship between the state and its people, determining whether citizens live as free participants or obedient subjects in the affairs of governance."

It provides easy access to vast amounts of information, helping students, professionals, and researchers with their work and studies. The internet enables quick communication through emails, video calls, and social media, connecting people across the globe. It also offers entertainment through movies, music, games, and online shopping, making life more convenient and enjoyable. Moreover, many businesses rely on the internet for marketing, sales, and customer service, boosting economic growth.\nHowever, the internet also has its downsides when misused. One major abuse is the spread of false information and fake news, which can create confusion and panic. Cyberbullying, hacking, and online scams are serious problems that affect many users. Excessive use of the internet, especially social media and gaming, can lead to addiction, affecting mental and physical health. Privacy is another concern, as personal information can be stolen or misused.\nIn conclusion, while the internet is a powerful tool with many positive uses, it is important to use it responsibly. Awareness and proper regulation can help minimize its abuses and maximize its benefits for everyone."

These foods taste delicious and look very tempting. Many fast-food shops in big cities make tasty snacks, and people enjoy eating them with friends and family. One reason poeple like fast food is that it is quick and easy to buy. When families go out, they often eat at fast-food restaurants. Many kids also see fast food in TV ads, and they want to try it. Some fast-food shops even give free toys with meals, which makes children more excited. But eating too much fast food is not good for health. It has a lot of oil, salt, and sugar, which can make us unhealthy. Eating too much can cause stomach problems, weight gain, and weak teeth. Instead of fast food, we should brave balanced diet. We should eat home-cooked meals like rice, fish, vegetables, and fruits. These foods make us strong and healthy. Fast food is tasty, but we should not eat it every day. Eating it sometimes is acceptable, but healthy food is always the best choice. So, we have to be careful while choosing our food."

Folk music and Modern music are two genres of music that have remained popular throughout history. Each has their distinct characteristics, and both are important genres of music. Folk music reminds us of our cultural heritage and connects us to a communal identity. On the other hand, Modern music mirrors the evolution of society and embraces new forms of musical expression. Folk music is traditional music that originates from a particular community or culture. This type of music has been passed down from generation to generation and usually tells stories about everyday life experiences. Modern music, on the contrary, is a popular form of music that has developed in recent times. This genre of music includes various styles such as rock, pop, hip-hop, and electronic music. Again, Folk music is often described as raw, soulful, and authentic. On the other hand, Modern music is seen as being more innovative and experimental, utilizing electronic sounds, digital effects, and creative music production. Audience is another difference here. Folk music is often associated with a classy and sophisticated audience who understands the tradition and culture behind it. Modern music has a wider these appeal and is enjoyed by people from different cultures and backgrounds. Though there are many differences between two genres, both Folk music and Modern music share some common features like lyricism, melody, and rhythm. Many modern songs are inspired by Folk music elements and are often combined with electronic sounds to create a unique sound that appeals to modern audiences. Irrespective of our preferences, music is a universal language that speaks to our souls and unites us as human beings.\n"

However, city life can also be stressful due to traffic jams, pollution, noise, and overcrowding. In contrast, rural life is peaceful, quiet, and closer to nature. The air is fresher, and people live in a more relaxed and friendly environment. Life in villages is simple, but often lacks modern facilities such as advanced medical care, good schools, or job options. While urban life brings comfort and variety, rural life offers tranquility and a strong sense of community.

People, especially the poor, shiver in the cold, wrapping themselves in old blankets or warm clothes. The trees stand still, covered in dew, and everything appears calm and sleepy. Farmers and laborers light fires on the roadside to warm themselves. Children often hesitate to leave their cozy beds, and schools start a bit later than usual. The beauty of a winter morning is enhanced by the golden sunlight that gradually pierces through the fog, making everything glisten. Breakfasts are special during this time, with hot rice cakes (pithas), date juice, and fresh molasses being enjoyed by many. Despite the discomfort, a winter morning has its own charm and quiet beauty that brings a sense of peace and simplicity to life."

Technical education focuses on imparting specific skills and knowledge related to particular trades, crafts, or professions. It is practical and hands-on, aiming to prepare students directly for the workforce. For instance, courses in engineering, information technology, and vocational training fall under this category. Conversely, general education encompasses a broader curriculum that includes the humanities, sciences, and social sciences. Its purpose is to provide a well-rounded education, fostering critical thinking, creativity, and a broader understanding of the world.\nWhile technical education equips students with specialized skills needed for specific careers, general education provides a foundational knowledge base that can be applied across various fields. Technical education often leads to immediate job opportunities and is highly valued in industries that require specific technical skills. On the other hand, general education promotes intellectual development and is beneficial for roles that require analytical thinking, problem-solving, and adaptability.\nIn essence, technical education is more focused and job-oriented, while general education is broad and holistic, aiming to develop versatile individuals who can adapt to various professional environments. Both types of education are essential: technical education for developing skilled professionals and general education for creating informed and thoughtful citizens."

Trees are often referred to as the lungs of the planet, as they absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen through the process of photosynthesis, thereby mitigating the impacts of climate change and ensuring a breathable atmosphere. Additionally, trees provide habitat and food for countless species of wildlife, contributing to biodiversity conservation. Moreover, tree roots help prevent soil erosion, stabilize slopes, and regulate water cycles by absorbing excess rainfall and reducing the risk of flooding and droughts. Beyond environmental benefits, tree plantation also has significant socio-economic advantages. Trees provide valuable resources such as timber, fruits, nuts, and medicinal products, supporting livelihoods and economic development in rural communities. Furthermore, green spaces created by tree plantation enhance the aesthetic appeal of urban areas, promote mental well-being, and provide recreational opportunities for residents. Overall, tree plantation is essential for maintaining ecological balance, combating climate change, supporting biodiversity, and fostering sustainable development. It is a collective responsibility that each individual and community must embrace to ensure a greener and healthier planet for present and future generations."

The name Mocha is derived from the Yemeni port of Mokha. Cyclone Mocha slammed'the coastlines of Bangladesh and Myanmar, affecting millions of people. It is one of the strongest storms to hit the Bay of Bengal in more than a decade. It intensifies with sustained winds of 161 m p h 161 \\mathrm{mph} 161 mph and guts as strong as 195 m p h 195 \\mathrm{mph} 195 mph . In preparation for Cyclone Mocha, airports were closed, fishermen were ordered to suspend their work, and 1,500 shelters. were set up for people from vulnerable areas to take over in safer places. Bangladesh's government had evacuated (সরিয়ে দেওয়া) 7,50,000 people ahead of the storm, but Rohingya refugees were not allowed to leave their permanent structures. It is estimated that 1300 shelters and 16 mosques and learning centers were damaged by the gusty winds. Fallen trees and landslides have caused more damage. Meanwhile, the Maritime' ports of Chattogram, Cox's Bazar, and Payra were advised to hoist great danger signal 10. Besides, Mongla seaport was asked to show a local warning signal 4. Coastal districts of Cox's Bazar, Chattogram, Feni, Noakhali, Lakshmipur, Chandpur, Barishal, Bhola, Patuakhali, Jhalakathi, Pirojpur, Barguna and their nearby islands and chars were under great danger signal 8. Bangladesh largely escaped the worst impacts of very severe cyclone Mocha, as the storm barely touched the country's south-eastern tip while making landfall on the Bangladesh and Myanmar coast. The cyclone, however, made a mess of St. Martin's Island, about 9 k m 9 \\mathrm{~km} 9 km south of the south-eastern tip of mainland Bangladesh, with a battering wind up to 147 k p h 147 \\mathrm{kph} 147 kph , levelling about 1100 houses, and shapping 3,200 trees.

          "explanation": "Frequent Road Accidents — Their Causes and Effects in Bangladesh\nRoad accidents are a serious problem in Bangladesh, causing many deaths and injuries every year. Several factors contribute to the high number of accidents in the country. One of the main causes is reckless driving, such as speeding, dangerous overtaking, and ignoring traffic rules. Many drivers are not properly trained or licensed, which increases the risk. Overloaded vehicles and poor vehicle maintenance also lead to frequent breakdowns and accidents. Moreover, the condition of roads in many areas is poor, with potholes, narrow lanes, and lack of proper traffic signs. The absence of strict law enforcement and corruption among traffic officials sometimes allows reckless drivers to go unpunished.\nThe effects of these frequent accidents are devastating for families and society. Many victims suffer serious injuries or lose their lives, leaving families emotionally and financially shattered. Road accidents also cause traffic jams, loss of productivity, and increase the burden on healthcare services. The economic loss due to damage to vehicles and infrastructure is enormous.\nTo reduce road accidents, Bangladesh needs stricter traffic laws, better road infrastructure, and public awareness campaigns about safe driving. Proper training for drivers and stronger law enforcement can save many lives and create safer roads for everyone."

We earn money to get everything necessary in life. But money can't buy happiness. No matter how difficult it is to earn money, to gain happiness is even more difficult. Even after having enough money, we can't guarantee happiness. Money is one thing, and happiness is quite another. Although we can have enough money for our basic necessities, happiness doesn't always come along with that. It is possible that despite being rich, one is still not happy. On the contrary, a poor man can live in happiness as happiness lies in contentment. There is nothing wrong about wanting to earn more money, but one should not forget one's family and social life. In the pursuit of wealth, one may lose one's most important relationships with friends and family. Furthermore, our mental and physical health can be affected badly because of dissatisfaction and lack of selfdiscipline. Besides, if a man gets embroiled in social crisis, money itself cannot relieve him of the pains. Therefore, money is not essential to happiness.\n"

In order to show due honour and respect to the existing mother languages of different countries, the day has been declared as International Mother Language Day by UNESCO. In reply to a proposal from Bangladesh Govt., the declaration has come to reality. The day has a long glorious historical background (পটতৃমি). It is a matter of great regret that the then rulers of Pakistan tried to impose \"Urdu' as the state language upon us instead of Bangla. Before the independence of our country in 1952, the then Pakistani ruler Jinnah declared in the public meeting that \"Urdu and only Urdu shall be the state language of Pakistan.\". The people of our country burst into (ফ্টে পড়া) protest against this unjustified decision. Some of the heroic sons of this soil came forward and sacrificed their valuable lives for the cause of the mother tongue on the 21 st February. 1952. The objective of observing the day is to pay homage to the language martyrs. The day is greatly important for the people of Bangladesh. Now, it is a matter of great pleasure and prestige that this day got international recognition (ন্বীकৃতি) in 1999 as International Mother Language Day."

It is three miles away from Bagerhat and we reached there by rickshaw. We were surprised to see the architectural structures of the mosque. It stands on sixty pillars and has seventy seven exquisitely curved domes.\n\n\nThe area of mosque is very large and charming. There is a long tank near the mosque named ‘Ghoradighi’. The mosque has been declared as a world heritage site. In fact, this mosque is one of the greatest tourist attractions of Bangladesh. We came to know that this mosque was used not only as a prayer hall but also as a court of justice. We also felt ecstasy to see the unique design of the Mazar of Khan Jahan Ali. It stands on a raised ground. The tomb is made of cutting stone. There is a big tank in front of the mazar. There are some crocodiles in this big tank. When the caretaker called them, they came near.

The concept, introduced by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 2008, aims to harness the power of digital technology to improve various sectors, such as education, healthcare, governance, and business, thereby promoting overall national development. One of the key aspects of Digital Bangladesh is the expansion of internet connectivity across the country, including rural areas, which has enabled millions of people to access information, communicate, and participate in the digital economy.\nThe government has made significant investments in building infrastructure for digital services, including the development of e-governance systems, digital banking, and online education platforms. These initiatives have not only increased the efficiency of public services but have also provided greater transparency and accountability. In education, online learning platforms and digital classrooms have made learning more accessible, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, when schools shifted to virtual classes.\nFurthermore, the rise of the digital economy has created new opportunities for young entrepreneurs in e-commerce, freelancing, and digital marketing. The government's efforts to develop digital skills among the youth through training programs have led to an increase in the number of IT professionals, contributing to the country’s growing tech industry.\nDespite the progress, challenges remain, such as digital literacy gaps, cybersecurity concerns, and the need for further infrastructure development in remote areas.

With advancements in communication and transportation, countries are now more interconnected than ever before. Modern technology, such as the internet and smartphones, has made it easier for people to communicate across continents instantly. Businesses can now operate on a global scale, trading goods and services with ease. This has led to economic growth and opportunities for many countries.\nHowever, globalization and modern technology also bring challenges. Cultural identities can become diluted as Western influences spread worldwide through media and entertainment. Moreover, there are concerns about job losses due to automation and outsourcing to cheaper labor markets. Despite these challenges, globalization has also led to cultural exchange and understanding between nations. People can now learn about different cultures and traditions through the click of a button, fostering tolerance and cooperation.In conclusion, while globalization and modern technology have their pros and cons, they have undeniably reshaped our world."

Celebrated on April 14th each year, this festival marks the beginning of the new year in the Bengali calendar, which holds deep historical significance. Rooted in centuries-old traditions, Pahela Boishakh brings together people from all walks of life, transcending religious and social boundaries. The day is celebrated with great enthusiasm through various cultural events, parades, and gatherings, with the iconic sight of people wearing traditional attire, particularly the colorful sarees for women and panjabis for men. The celebration also features the consumption of special foods, such as panta bhat (fermented rice) with hilsa fish, and the practice of \"alpona\" (decorating homes with colorful patterns), all of which symbolize prosperity, happiness, and a fresh start. Moreover, Pahela Boishakh serves as a reminder of the importance of unity and the collective spirit of the Bengali people, as it has evolved into a secular celebration of culture, literature, and the arts. The day is also a time for reflection and renewal, where people take the opportunity to let go of past grievances, embrace new beginnings, and celebrate the resilience and beauty of Bengali traditions. Whether in the streets of Dhaka or the villages across the country, the celebration of Pahela Boishakh is a testament to the enduring spirit of the Bangladeshi people and their deep connection to their cultural roots."

To be a warrior of light or a torchbearer of truth, we have to be enlightened. Education has the power to enlighten us by broadening our outlook, increasing our knowledge and wisdom, refining our sensibility, improving our humanity and altruism (পরার্থপরতী), making us virtuous, enhancing our ability or skins, providing us with information and removing our darkness (ignorance, prejudice, superstition, narrowmindedness, doubt, fear, depression, etc.) of mind. A warrior of light must reason sensibly and have good feelings for others. Education helps us reason sensibly and distinguish (প্রভেদ করা) the right from the wrong. It promotes mutual understanding, humanity and universal brotherhood. A warrior of light possesses some good values, awareness, consciousness, and latent qualities that education helps him discover and explore. He has to face challenges in executing (সম্পাদন করা) his duties and responsibilities to his family, society and the world. Education builds the warrior's personality to face such challenges. Education makes him transform other lives by rendering hope, inspiration, support, vitality, warmth, love, compassion, and positive vibrations. So, the necessities of education for becoming a warrior of light are a must."

          "explanation": "My Dreams and My Realities\nA dream is similar to wishing for something to happen or to have an ambitious goal. This wish may or may not come true, but the strong desire behind it helps a person continue dreaming. There are many different kinds of dreams. Someone dreams of learning to play a guitar while someone dreams of buying a house. On the other hand, reality is the state of how things exist. Reality leaves no scope for assumption since it represents everything as they are. At times, dreams and realities clash with each other. For example, my dream is to read all the books in the world. But the reality is that there are so many books in the world that it is not possible for me to read every ore of them. I also have a dream that one day I will live in a traffic jam free Dhaka. There is no guarantee whether Dhaka will be able to reduce its traffic congestion in the future. But at the moment, the reality is that Dhaka is a densely populated city and the population in the country is rapidly growing by day. Consequently, my dreams are most likely to remain unfulfilled. However, some dreams can be achieved with hard work and dedication. Being good at sports used to be a dream of mine. Now I can play cricket, football, badminton, tennis and various other types of sports due to the reason that I participated and practiced for a long period of time. My reality was that I did not know how to play these games but I remained persistent. Therefore, a person should always keep dreaming and look for ways to make the dream come true."

Founded in 1983 by Nobel Laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus, the bank operates on a unique model of providing small loans, or microcredit, to the poor without requiring any collateral. The main goal of Grameen Bank is to empower the underprivileged, enabling them to start small businesses and improve their standard of living. Unlike traditional banks, it focuses on trust, group accountability, and community support. Over 90% of its borrowers are women, who have used the loans to engage in activities like weaving, poultry farming, and grocery trading. This financial independence has not only reduced poverty but also promoted gender equality in rural areas. The bank’s success has inspired similar microcredit programs across the globe. In 2006, both Grameen Bank and Professor Yunus were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to create economic and social development from below. Grameen Bank has proven that even the poorest of the poor can be creditworthy and that access to finance is a powerful tool for social change. It remains a symbol of hope, empowerment, and grassroots development."

We lived in the same neighborhood and attended the same school. From the very beginning, we shared a special bond built on trust, fun, and understanding. We spent countless hours playing together in the nearby park, riding bicycles, and exploring the fields around our homes. Rafiq was always kind, loyal, and ready to help me whenever I was in trouble. We studied together, shared our secrets, and supported each other through difficult times.\nWhat made our friendship special was the way we could communicate without words — just a smile or a look was enough to understand each other. Even though we sometimes had small disagreements, they never lasted long because we valued our friendship deeply. Over the years, we grew up and went to different schools, but our bond remained strong. Rafiq taught me the true meaning of friendship — loyalty, honesty, and caring for each other. I am grateful for having such a wonderful friend during my childhood, and those memories will always stay close to my heart."

          "explanation": "The Demerits of Gender Discrimination\nGender discrimination in a society reflects that the basic human rights of the people have not been ensured. It depicts the unfair treatment of people in a society simply based on their gender. This discrimination is one of the major factors that contributes to the establishment of gender inequality. According to the United Nations, gender equality is, first and foremost, a human right. Gender discrimination takes away this right by challenging gender equality. Alternatively, it proceeds individual concern and affects the society as a whole. A nation can progress well when it can fully utilize its manpower. If there is gender discrimination, then a great portion of its\npopulation ultimately struggles to find opportunities for growth. In addition, when someone faces hindrance repeatedly in life, it results in a loss of interest which eventually leads to less productivity. It may possess detrimental impact on mental health, potentially triggering stress and anxiety. Again, less productivity not only affects us personally but also affects the overall economic growth of the country. Moreover, gender discrimination reinforces gender stereotypes in a society. The unjust treatment of a particular gender signifies that someone has more power than the other. Furthermore; this imbalance of power challenges individuality and creates limitations. Thus, gender discrimination can be called a harmful weapon that hinders growth and prosperity."

          "explanation": "Merits and Demerits of Introducing AI in the Classrooms of Bangladesh\nThe integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Bangladeshi classrooms offers both promising benefits and significant challenges. One of the key merits is personalized learning. AI can analyze individual student performance and deliver tailored content that matches their learning pace and style. This can especially benefit underperforming students who need extra attention. Moreover, AI tools can automate administrative tasks like grading, attendance, and scheduling, allowing teachers to focus more on instruction and mentorship. In remote or rural areas with a shortage of skilled educators, AI-based tutoring systems can help bridge the gap in quality education.\nHowever, the demerits are also worth noting. A major concern is the digital divide—many schools in Bangladesh lack the infrastructure, internet access, and electricity needed to implement AI effectively. There is also the risk of over-reliance on technology, which may reduce human interaction in classrooms, essential for emotional and social development. Furthermore, AI systems may not fully understand the cultural and contextual nuances of Bangladesh, potentially leading to miscommunication or ineffective content delivery. Privacy and data security of students is another pressing issue.\nIn conclusion, while AI has the potential to revolutionize education in Bangladesh, it must be introduced thoughtfully, with proper infrastructure, teacher training, and equity-focused policies in place."

One of the primary causes is the excessive emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide. These gases are released through burning fossil fuels in vehicles, factories, and power plants, as well as deforestation and certain agricultural practices. Industrialization and rapid urbanization have also increased the concentration of these harmful gases in the atmosphere.\nThe effects of global warming are alarming and widespread. Rising temperatures lead to the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers, causing sea levels to rise and threatening coastal areas with flooding. Changes in climate patterns result in extreme weather events such as hurricanes, droughts, and heavy rainfall, which disrupt ecosystems and agriculture. Global warming also affects biodiversity, leading to the extinction of many plant and animal species. Human health is at risk due to increased heatwaves, spread of diseases, and food shortages caused by crop failures.\nTo mitigate global warming, it is essential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by using renewable energy, planting trees, and adopting sustainable practices. Awareness and cooperation at both individual and global levels are necessary to protect our planet for future generations."

          "explanation": "The Impacts of Social Media on Teenagers\nSocial media has become an inseparable part of teenage life, influencing their behavior, mindset, and lifestyle in both positive and negative ways. First and foremost, it enhances connectivity. Teenagers can easily communicate with friends and family, share ideas, and build social networks across the globe. Secondly, it provides a platform for self-expression. Through posts, stories, and videos, teenagers showcase their talents, opinions, and creativity. Thirdly, social media can be educational. It offers access to a wealth of information, online learning resources, and academic discussions that can support schoolwork and general knowledge.\nHowever, the negative impacts are equally significant. One major issue is addiction. Excessive use of social media often leads to procrastination, poor academic performance, and sleep disturbances. Secondly, it fosters unrealistic comparisons. Teenagers often compare their lives with the curated content of others, which may result in low self-esteem, anxiety, or depression. Thirdly, cyberbullying is a serious concern. Many teenagers fall victim to online harassment, which can have long-lasting emotional effects. Lastly, privacy and security are at risk, as teens may unknowingly share sensitive information or become targets of scams.\nIn conclusion, social media is a powerful tool that shapes teenage behavior and perception. While it offers opportunities for learning and connection, it also demands responsible use. Parents, educators, and teenagers themselves must work together to balance its advantages with its potential harms, ensuring that social media supports, rather than disrupts, a healthy developmental journey."

It means the rules of correct behaviour in society. On the other hand, 'manners' is an English word. It means the behaviour that is considered to be polite in a particular society or culture. In English there is a slight difference between the meanings of the words 'manner' and 'manners'. Manner refers to usual behaviour towards others. It may be good or bad. However, the word 'manners' is the plural form of the word 'manner'. It refers to polite ways of treating people. Speaking with food in one's mouth is socially considered a bad manner. A bad mannered person has less social acceptance. Everybody dislikes him. The idea of 'etiquette' and 'manners' is not same. It varies from culture to culture and society to society. The best institute of learning 'etiquette\" and 'manners' is the family. We learn it from our parents at our very early age. We also learn it in schools, colleges and from professional bodies. Every social occasion has its own rules of behaviour. They are different from each other. Some behaviour may appropriate in a wedding ceremony, but inappropriate in deering from So, we must be careful about 'etiquette' and 'manners\" as they represent the quality of individuals.\""

          "explanation": "Deforestation\nDeforestation is the process of cutting down or clearing large areas of forests for various human activities such as agriculture, urban development, and logging. It has become a serious environmental issue worldwide, including in many developing countries. Trees play a vital role in maintaining ecological balance by producing oxygen, absorbing carbon dioxide, and providing habitat for wildlife. When forests are destroyed, this balance is disturbed, leading to numerous harmful effects.\nOne major cause of deforestation is the need for more land to grow crops or raise livestock to meet the demands of a growing population. Logging for timber and paper production also contributes significantly to forest loss. Additionally, urban expansion and infrastructure development often result in clearing forested areas.\nThe effects of deforestation are severe. It leads to loss of biodiversity as many plants and animals lose their natural homes. Soil erosion increases because tree roots no longer hold the soil in place, which reduces soil fertility and causes floods. Deforestation also contributes to climate change, as fewer trees mean less carbon dioxide absorption, increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\nTo combat deforestation, it is important to promote sustainable forestry, plant more trees, and raise awareness about the importance of forests. Protecting forests is essential for preserving nature and ensuring a healthy environment for future generations."

One primary cause is a deficiency in foundational language skills, including grammar, vocabulary, and comprehension, which can impede a student's ability to grasp and communicate effectively in English. Additionally, limited exposure to English-speaking environments or resources can hinder language acquisition and fluency. Poor study habits, such as procrastination or lack of practice, also contribute to failure as consistent effort and engagement are essential for mastery. Furthermore, external factors like socio-economic disparities or inadequate educational support can exacerbate challenges in learning English, particularly for marginalized communities. The effects of failure in English are multifaceted, extending beyond academic repercussions to impact future opportunities and self-esteem. Academic setbacks, including low grades or inability to meet language requirements, can hinder educational advancement and career prospects. Moreover, language barriers may impede communication and integration in diverse social and professional settings, limiting opportunities for personal and professional growth. Ultimately, addressing the root causes of failure in English requires holistic support systems that encompass effective teaching methodologies, equitable access to resources, and socio-economic empowerment."

A hostel life cannot provide the parental love and guidance. The dwellers have to depend on self-service, which sometimes turns to be a blessing. In hostel life, a student learns to be fit for practical life and s/he becomes self-reliant. Since one has to manage everything by oneself, one learns how to cope with the realities of life. In hostel life, one gets complete liberty, which may cause havoc. If one is not conscious of one's time and duties, he/she can easily go astray. We get familial help and guidance in a family. But sometimes we have to perform some duties towards our families. Sometimes a student cannot make the best use of time. But in a hostel life, a student gets ample time to read and learn.

          "explanation": "Junk Food and Healthy Food\nFood is a basic necessity of life and there are many different kinds of them. They vary in ingredients, taste, nutritional values and so on. Junk food and healthy food are two different categories of food that we can consume but differ in how they will impact our body. In general, junk food is prepared from ingredients containing a large amount of unhealthy fats, sodium and sugar. While these ingredients make the food taste fairly appetizing, they fail to provide the necessary nutrients, vitamins and minerals. Moreover, junk food is most of the times affordable, easily accessible, and even easy to prepare at home. So, it is very convenient to settle on junk food any time of the day. Unfortunately, due to its harmful ingredients and the lack of essential nutrients, junk food may lead to serious health issues like heart disease, diabetes, obesity, digestive disorder, etc. On the contrary, healthy food offers a lot of health benefits. They are prepared from unprocessed and fresh ingredients with necessary nutrients, vitamins and minerals. Eating healthy food improves our overall health by lowering the risks of heart diseases, boosting our immunity, and many other health benefits for healthy growth. But healthy food in comparison to junk food requires more preparation time. Additionally, fresh ingredients need to be collected regularly and stored carefully to preserve its nutritional values. Despite the hassle, healthy food is a preferred option over junk food for many for its healthy benefits. At the end of the day, a healthy life is all about balance.\n"

It has connected the capital with 21 southern districts of Bangladesh. It is 6.15 kilometres long and 18.18 metres wide. It has 41 spans on 42 pillars. The cost of the mega project is Tk. 30,193.39 crore. This mega project is being funded from the own resources of the government of Bangladesh. It is a truss bridge and the material of the bridge is steel. The bridge has increased connectivity beyond the boundary. It has established direct road communication between Dhaka and the southern parts of the country. It has opened up huge possibilities in the tourism (পর্যটন) sectors in Bangladesh. Traders can take their goods directly to the capital. They can make profit by supplying their fresh products to the buyers. The bridge has cut the travel time between Dhaka and Mongla Port. It will reduce overall poverty and contribute to industrial development, regional trade, agricultural expansion, etc. Soon after its inauguration of the Padma Bridge by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on 25 June 2022.15,200 vehicles cross it in the first 8 hours. A total of 24000 vehicles cross the Padma Bridge every day. The bridge has ensured the increase of GDP growth rate by more than 1%. Due to poor connectivity economic operation in the south-western zone has not been too easy. Consequently (অতএব), the districts did not seize much industrialization (শিল্পায়ন). As a result, poverty and unemployment constitute major problem in this region. However, the Padma Bridge will offer many advantages to the region. It will unveil the door of opportunity for industrialization which will remove unemployment problem."

In a country, if there are more able people than the total number of jobs, there is an unemployment problem. Bangladesh is now seriously facing this problem. An unemployed person is generally either frustrated or an idle brain. Moreover, when they are not in any service, they hardly care anyone. There is a popular saying, \"An idle brain is the devil's workshop.\" Nowadays, the social disorder is mainly caused by unemployment. Hence, it is a great curse in our country.We can, however, change our condition by ourselves. The first thing that can be done is to control the high birth rate of our population. We all desire to work in cities. This tendency should be changed. We can engage ourselves in self-employment in our rural areas. In this context, the government should help the unemployed people with technical education and financial support. The government should increase facilities in the field of technology. Moreover, the guardians of the society can help their children most. They can help them with good advice and guidance.\n"

But what is causing our society to engage in such ominous (অশুভ/ভীতিজনক) deeds? We don't need to go far to seek the answer. It is nothing but lack of moral teaching and religious counselling in educational and social institutions. The greed for money and power, injustice and discrimination in society, excessive desire or mania to gain something illegally and disrespecting the law of the country are also the causes of present degradation of moral or social values among the youths. But, time is passing away fast to think over the issues. So, it is time that recovery must be started from the grass roots and the leaders, parents, teachers, and other social stakeholders must understand that the need of the moment is to acknowledge the most heinous moral degradation."

          "explanation": "The indiscriminate cutting of trees is a pressing environmental issue with far-reaching consequences. One of the primary causes of large-scale deforestation is the demand for timber and land for agriculture. As populations grow and economies develop, there is increased pressure to clear forests for urbanization and industrial activities. Additionally, logging for commercial purposes and the expansion of infrastructure contribute significantly to deforestation.The environmental effects of indiscriminate tree cutting are severe. Forests play a crucial role in regulating the climate by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. Their destruction leads to increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, exacerbating global warming and climate change. Moreover, deforestation disrupts ecosystems, leading to loss of biodiversity as habitats are destroyed. This, in turn, threatens the survival of numerous plant and animal species, some of which may be unique to specific forest ecosystems.Furthermore, deforestation contributes to soil erosion and alters local rainfall patterns, impacting agricultural productivity and water availability. The loss of forests also reduces the natural protection against natural disasters like floods and landslides. In conclusion, addressing the issue of indiscriminate tree cutting is crucial for mitigating climate change, preserving biodiversity, and ensuring sustainable development for future generations."

Trees are often called the “lungs of the Earth” because they absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, which is essential for all living beings. They help reduce air pollution, prevent soil erosion, and maintain the fertility of the land. Tree roots hold the soil firmly and prevent landslides and floods. Moreover, trees provide shade, reduce the temperature, and act as natural air conditioners, especially in urban areas.\nTrees are also a source of food, medicine, and raw materials for many industries. They provide shelter and habitat to countless birds and animals, supporting biodiversity. In addition, forests created through tree plantations play a significant role in maintaining the water cycle by attracting rainfall and preserving underground water levels.\nIn today’s world, where deforestation and climate change are growing threats, tree plantation is more important than ever. It is a simple but effective way to combat global warming and protect the environment for future generations. Therefore, individuals, communities, and governments must take active steps to plant more trees and protect existing ones. Tree plantation is not just an environmental duty—it is an investment in a greener, healthier future."

One of the main causes of climate change is the increase in greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere. These gases are primarily released by burning fossil fuels for energy, deforestation, industrial activities, and intensive agriculture. Human activities like cutting down forests reduce the planet’s ability to absorb carbon dioxide, worsening the problem. Additionally, pollution from factories and vehicles adds to the accumulation of harmful gases, trapping heat and causing global temperatures to rise.\nThe effects of climate change are far-reaching and serious. Rising global temperatures lead to the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers, which causes sea levels to rise, threatening coastal areas with flooding. It also results in more frequent and intense natural disasters such as hurricanes, droughts, and wildfires. Changing weather patterns disrupt agriculture, leading to food shortages and economic losses. Many animal and plant species face extinction as their natural habitats are destroyed or altered. Climate change also poses health risks to humans by increasing heat-related illnesses and spreading diseases.\nTo combat climate change, it is crucial to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by adopting renewable energy sources, protecting forests, and promoting sustainable living.

Domestic violence is often found in various parts of the nation related to dowry, and sadly most of them go unreported. Dowry means transferring wealth in any form from the bride’s family to the groom’s. It is a way to showcase love and care and help the newly wedded couple start their journey without any difficulty. But with time, it has found different meanings, and as a result, young girls around the nation suffer from various crimes and domestic violence.\nThe Dowry system has been in our country since ever, and even after the legal intervention, it is getting harder to eradicate it for so long. The simple process of transfer of poverty has become a deep-rooted problem for our society. And many tough girls and their families have to go through hardship every time in our country.\nDowry is a punishable crime in our nation. To protect young girls from various dowry-related injustice, reports against dowry are given priority. But most crimes are never reported, the domestic violence is at an increasing rate. The lack of proper education and awareness is a major reason for these increasing crimes. Many young girls are even pushed to the face of death for dowry."

It falls on the 14th of April and is a symbol of the country’s rich culture and heritage. People from all walks of life, regardless of age, religion, or background, come together to celebrate this day with great enthusiasm. The day usually begins with the traditional song “Esho He Baishakh” , sung at dawn under the open sky, especially at Ramna Batamul in Dhaka. People wear traditional clothes—men in panjabi and women in white sarees with red borders.\nColorful processions, known as Mangal Shobhajatra , are brought out in many towns and cities, promoting peace and unity. Traditional foods like panta ilish (fermented rice with hilsa fish) are enjoyed with friends and family. Fairs, cultural programs, music, and dance are common throughout the day. Shops often open a Haal Khata (new account book) and offer sweets to customers.\nPahela Baishakh is not just a festival—it is a reflection of Bengali identity and a time to forget past sorrows and welcome the new year with hope and happiness. It promotes harmony, tradition, and the spirit of togetherness in the nation."

          "explanation": "Student Politics in Bangladesh\nWhen students take part in political activities, it is called 'Student politics'. In Bangladesh, student politics has a long history. During the Language Movement of 1952 and the Liberation War of 1971, students played a big role. They fought for the country's freedom and rights. Today, student politics exists in almost all universities and colleges. Many students join different political groups. Some of them work for student rights, like better education, lower fees, and good facilities. But sometimes, student politics causes problems. Some students misuse politics for personal gain. There are fights and violence between different groups. This creates a bad environment in educational institutions. Many students feel unsafe, and their studies are disturbed. Student politics can be good if students work for the welfare of others. They should focus on helping people and improving education. But if they get involved in violence, it is harmful for the country. The government and universities should make sure that student politics is peaceful and helpful. Education should be the first priority for students. If student politics is done in the right way, it can help build a better future for Bangladesh."

Values like honesty, kindness, respect, and responsibility shape our character and influence how we treat others. A person with strong moral values earns trust and respect in society. In schools, homes, and communities, teaching these values is essential for building a peaceful and ethical world. Without them, society becomes selfish, unjust, and chaotic. Moral values also help us make better decisions, even in difficult situations. They are not just rules, but the inner compass that leads to personal growth and harmony. In today’s fast-paced world, where materialism often takes over, moral values remind us of what truly matters. They are vital for both personal success and a better society."

          "explanation": "Causes and Effects of Unemployment in Bangladesh\nUnemployment refers to the state of a person, capable of working, unable to find a paid job. In Bangladesh, unemployment still remains as one of the significant challenges. In order to address this issue hindering economic growth, the causes of unemployment need to be explored first. Rapid population growth is a major factor behind the unemployment rate. In comparison to the population, there are not enough job opportunities in the market. So, when a fresh graduate or anyone from the working-age enters the job market, the competition is quite fierce for a single seat. On the other hand, due to the digitalization of the country, laborers are being replaced with machines in the work field. Although automation helps businesses by improving its productivity and accuracy, it leaves a gap in the job market by reducing job opportunities. Lack of proper training and workoriented education are some of the other contributing factors regarding unemployment. The effect of unemployment falls directly on the economy of the country. Without a source of an income, unemployed people fail to provide themselves and their families with basic necessities. As a result, their standard of living meets no improvement. The pressure of finding a job and affording expenses collectively may cause extreme mental health issues for the people involved. It is a serious issue that the government cannot fix alone; we should all come forward to build a better nation by reducing unemployment in the country."

There are different reasons why someone may be a stranger to us. One reason is travelling. When people visit a new place, they do not know anyone there, so they become strangers. Another reason is moving to a new area. When families shift to a different city or village, they take time to know their neighbours. Sometimes, a stranger can be someone lost or in trouble, asking for directions or help. Meeting strangers can have different effects. Some strangers are kind and helpful. They give directions or offer help when needed. But some strangers may be dangerous. They may try to cheat or harm people. This is why, we must be careful while talking to strangers. Children should never trust strangers easily and always inform parents if a stranger talks to them. Strangers can become friends if we know them well.

But in Bangladesh, there are many challenges in the education system. First, many children, especially in villages, do not go to school. Some schools are far away, and some families are too poor to send their children to school. Many students drop out early because they have to work and help their families. Second, there are not enough schools, classrooms, and teachers. Many schools have too many students in one class. This makes it hard for teachers to give proper attention to each student. Some schools do not have good facilities like clean toilets, libraries, and playgrounds. Third, the quality of education is not the same everywhere. Some schools give better education, but many students in government schools do not get proper learning materials. It is also a fact that many teachers are not well-trained. Lastly, the political disorder in our country creates challenges for our education system. Publishing error-free books is also a challenge for the government in education sector. However, the government is trying to improve the standard of education. If we all work together, every child in Bangladesh can get a good education and build a better future."

Actually screen addiction refers to excessive and compulsive use of digital devices. Many students spend a lot of time on their smart phones, computers, and TVs. They use screens for playing games, watching videos, or chatting with friends. Technology can be fun and useful but too much screen time is harmful. Students often spend hours on their phones instead of studying or doing homework. This affects their learning and can lead to poor academic results. Many children also get less time to play outside or interact with family members and friends. As a result, they become more isolated and their health suffers. Prolonged screen time can cause problems like eye strain, headache, and even sleep disturbances. Too much screen time also contribute to conditions like anxiety and depression. The government and schools are trying to create awareness about the dangers of screen addiction. They can encourage students to spend more time on activities like reading books, playing sports, and socializing. Parents can also play an important role by setting limits on screen time at home. It is important to find a balance between using screens for learning and entertainment and spending time on healthy activities. If we control our screen time, we can have a healthier and happier life."

          "explanation": "Bribery\nBribery is a serious problem in Bangladesh. It happens when people give money or gifts illegally to get special favours. There are many reasons for bribery. One major cause is poverty. Many government employees receive low salaries, so some take bribes to earn extra money. Corruption is another big reason. When officials do not fear punishment, they continue to take bribes. Lack of strict laws and proper action also makes bribery worse. Many people do not get fair services unless they pay extra money, which forces them to give bribes. Bribery has many bad effects on society. It destroys fairness and justice. Poor people cannot get their rights because they cannot afford bribes. It also slows down development. When people get jobs or contracts by bribery instead of merit, the country suffers. Bribery also reduces people's trust in the government and law. To stop bribery, we need strict laws and honest officers. People should also raise their voices against corruption.

One of the primary causes is peer pressure, where young people, in an attempt to fit in or appear \"cool,\" fall into the trap of drug use. Lack of awareness and poor education about the harmful effects of drugs also play a significant role. Furthermore, the easy availability and accessibility of drugs contribute to the widespread addiction. The consequences of drug addiction are devastating. On an individual level, it leads to physical and mental health deterioration, including problems like brain damage, weakened immunity, and depression. Drug addiction ruins careers and dreams, leaving individuals with little hope for a better future. At the family level, the effects are equally devastating. Families of addicts often face emotional stress, financial instability, and the breakdown of relationships. The addictive behavior of one family member can disrupt the entire household, leading to strained bonds and, in some cases, family separations. On a societal level, drug addiction fuels crime, as addicts often resort to illegal activities to fund their habit. The overall social fabric weakens, leading to higher healthcare costs and a loss of productivity. If left unchecked, drug addiction can hinder the progress of the nation, making it essential to address this issue through education, proper rehabilitation, and stronger legal enforcement."

Too much screen time can also harm the eyes and health. Online education is helpful, but it has problems.

          "explanation": "Our Population – A Prospect or a Problem?\nPopulation is one of the most significant factors that determine the growth and development of a country. In the case of Bangladesh, its population has been both a source of potential and a challenge. With a population of over 170 million people in a relatively small area, Bangladesh is one of the most densely populated countries in the world. The importance of this population lies in its potential to drive economic growth, promote cultural diversity, and provide a young workforce that can contribute to national development. However, the situation is more complex, and the population also presents several challenges.\nOne of the main features of Bangladesh’s population is its youthful demographic. Nearly 40% of the population is below the age of 25, which is a huge advantage for the country. A young workforce can be an engine for economic growth, especially in sectors like manufacturing, services, and technology. This demographic can also fuel innovation, entrepreneurship, and a diverse labor market. Furthermore, the cultural richness and diversity of Bangladesh’s population are vital for the country’s heritage and social fabric.\nHowever, rapid population growth has its downsides. With limited resources and a lack of proper infrastructure, the country faces problems such as unemployment, poverty, overcrowding, and strain on healthcare and education systems. The pressure on the environment due to deforestation, pollution, and inadequate waste management is also a growing concern. Despite improvements in various sectors, poverty rates remain high, and access to quality healthcare and education is still a challenge for many people, particularly in rural areas.\nIn my opinion, Bangladesh’s population is both a prospect and a problem. The country has immense potential if it can harness the power of its young population by investing in education, skill development, and job creation. At the same time, it must address the challenges associated with overpopulation by promoting family planning, improving healthcare, and developing sustainable infrastructure. If managed properly, the population can be an asset, but without effective policies and investments, it could remain a serious challenge to the country's progress."

Firstly, the internet serves as a catalyst for economic growth by fostering entrepreneurship and enabling access to global markets. With the rise of e-commerce platforms and online marketplaces, businesses, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs), can reach a wider customer base both domestically and internationally, driving commerce and creating employment opportunities.\nMoreover, the internet has revolutionized education in Bangladesh, bridging gaps in access to quality learning resources. Online educational platforms and digital libraries offer students and educators access to a wealth of information and interactive learning materials, supplementing traditional classroom teaching methods and promoting lifelong learning.\nFurthermore, the internet enhances communication and connectivity, fostering social cohesion and civic engagement. Social media platforms serve as virtual town squares where citizens can voice their opinions, organize movements, and participate in public discourse, contributing to the democratization of information and strengthening civil society.\nAdditionally, the internet has transformed governance and public service delivery in Bangladesh. Government websites and online portals streamline administrative processes, facilitate access to essential services, and promote transparency and accountability in governance.\nIn conclusion, the internet plays a multifaceted role in Bangladesh, driving economic growth, enhancing education, facilitating communication, and transforming governance. Its pervasive influence underscores its importance as a fundamental tool for progress and development in the country."

Likewise, if we also don’t have an aim in our life, we won’t know where to reach. Thus to achieve it one has to overcome many obstacles and setbacks from time to time. I always wanted to be a professor and now my family is inspiring me to become a professor too. My parents are really supportive and they respect my decision. I have seen lots of my friends want to become a professor, and some of them want to pursue an MBA . There are a lot of aims and goals available that students can choose in their lives. Right now in this world, the top trending professions are Doctor, Teacher, Programmer, Designer, Architect, Marketer, Supervisor, Manager, Engineer, etc. Maybe you have something unique in you and you want to pursue that. So different people adopt different aims according to their inclinations, tastes or perceptions about life. My teachers are really helpful and are always guiding and helping me with my future plans.\nThey have always inspired me to do better and work harder. I was once explaining some doubts to my classmates and I realized that I really like explaining and teaching. Later, I experienced teaching while doing an internship with an NGO. I went to a slum and taught kids there. I felt a different kind of satisfaction after teaching them. At that time I realized that I had never felt happier than this and decided to become a professor. I am one who enjoys exploring new places and getting to know new cultures, languages, and cuisines, and working as a professor offers many chances for me to develop those interests. After my English Honours degree, I will prepare for the Master’s degree. Then I am planning to take the UGC NET exam. Another big plus is the working hours that academia can offer, which are frequently more flexible than in other professions.\nThe biggest advantage of being a professor is that I find jobs in many places worldwide. I am really honest and passionate about my aim in life. It is surely a long journey but I will try my best to reach my goal and I suggest everyone do the same. According to me, timely execution of an action plan with a proactive attitude is the key to success. One of the best ways to stay motivated is by visualizing the change and likewise by achieving step-by-step milestones."

          "explanation": "Importance of the Rivers in Bangladesh\nRivers are an integral part of Bangladesh's geography, culture, and livelihoods, playing a crucial role in shaping the nation's identity and sustaining its economy. For centuries, the rivers of Bangladesh have been hailed as the lifelines of the country, contributing to its prosperity and well-being in myriad ways.\nFirst and foremost, the rivers of Bangladesh serve as vital sources of water for irrigation, agriculture, and fisheries, supporting the livelihoods of millions of people who depend on them for their sustenance. The fertile floodplains along the banks of rivers like the Padma, Jamuna, and Meghna are renowned for their rich agricultural productivity, yielding crops such as rice, jute, and vegetables that form the backbone of the nation's economy.\nMoreover, the rivers of Bangladesh are crucial transportation arteries, facilitating the movement of goods, people, and commodities across the country. Traditional wooden boats, known as \"noukas\" and \"trawlers,\" ply the river routes, connecting remote villages to urban centers and enabling trade, commerce, and social interactions to flourish.\nFurthermore, the rivers of Bangladesh have immense cultural and ecological significance, serving as habitats for diverse flora and fauna and providing breeding grounds for fish and other aquatic species. They also play a central role in religious ceremonies, festivals, and rituals, with rivers like the Ganges holding sacred importance for millions of Hindus.\nDespite their immense importance, the rivers of Bangladesh are facing unprecedented threats and challenges, including pollution, encroachment, sedimentation, and unsustainable water management practices. Industrial effluents, agricultural runoff, and solid waste disposal have contaminated many rivers, endangering public health and ecological balance.\nIn conclusion, the rivers of Bangladesh are invaluable assets that must be protected and preserved for future generations. Efforts to mitigate pollution, promote sustainable water management practices, and raise awareness about the importance of rivers are essential to safeguarding the ecological integrity and socio-economic well-being of the nation. Only through concerted action and collective responsibility can we ensure that the rivers of Bangladesh continue to flow as symbols of life, vitality, and prosperity."

If they are educated and skilled, they can help the country grow. Many workers from Bangladesh work in other countries and send money home. In this way, they boost our economy. A big population also means we have more workers, doctors, teachers, and engineers to build a bright future. But having too many people can be a problem. There is not enough land, food, and jobs for everyone. Cities become crowded, and traffic gets worse. Many poor people do not have proper homes, schools, or hospitals. If people do not get proper education, they cannot find good jobs. This increases poverty, To make our population a prospect, we must focus on education and skill development. The government should create more jobs and control population growth. If we use our human resources wisely, our population will be a great strength. Exporting the trained and skilled manpower can be a great step forward to ensure the advantage of over population. So, our population is a prospect if we train and educate our people. But it can be a problem if we do not plan well.

          "question": "",
          "explanation": "\nPatriotism is more than just a word; it's a feeling that resides deep within the hearts of individuals who share a common bond with their country. In simple terms, patriotism is the love and devotion one has for their homeland. This essay explores the essence of patriotism, its significance in our daily lives, and how it contributes to the overall growth and prosperity of a nation.\n\n\n\nDefining Patriotism\n\n\nAt its core, patriotism is about love and loyalty to one's country. It's the recognition of the values, culture, and shared history that bind people together. This sentiment is not limited to grand gestures or extraordinary acts; it often finds expression in simple, everyday actions that collectively contribute to the betterment of society.\n\n\n\nLove for the Land\n\n\nPatriotism begins with a genuine love for the land one calls home. It's about appreciating the natural beauty, diverse landscapes, and resources that make a country unique. Whether it's the rolling hills, expansive plains, or the sparkling waters that surround us, patriotism involves recognizing and cherishing the inherent beauty of our homeland.\n\n\n\nCultural Identity\n\n\nA strong sense of patriotism is closely tied to cultural identity. It's the pride in the traditions, languages, and customs that have been passed down through generations. Embracing and celebrating cultural diversity fosters a sense of unity, enriching the fabric of the nation with a tapestry of different backgrounds and experiences.\n\n\n\nShared History\n\n\nPatriotism is also rooted in a shared history that forms the foundation of a nation. Understanding the struggles, triumphs, and challenges faced by previous generations fosters a sense of continuity and responsibility. By acknowledging the sacrifices made by those who came before us, we honor their legacy and contribute to the ongoing narrative of our country.\n\n\n\nIndividual Responsibility and Civic Duty\n\n\nOne of the essential aspects of patriotism is the recognition of individual responsibility and civic duty. It's not just about enjoying the benefits of living in a particular country; it's about actively participating in its growth and development. This can range from voting in elections to volunteering in local communities, each act contributing to the collective well-being of the nation.\n\n\n\nPatriotism in Daily Life\n\n\nWhile grand displays of patriotism, such as national celebrations and parades, are noteworthy, it is in the small, everyday actions that the true essence of patriotism is often found. Acts of kindness, respect for fellow citizens, and a commitment to upholding shared values are all expressions of patriotism in daily life.\n\n\n\nRespecting Differences\n\n\nA patriotic individual understands the importance of unity in diversity. Respecting the differences among fellow citizens, whether they be cultural, religious, or ideological, is a testament to a mature and inclusive patriotism. It involves fostering an environment where everyone feels valued and accepted, contributing to a stronger and more harmonious society.\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Stewardship\n\n\nCaring for the environment is another manifestation of patriotism. Recognizing that the health of the land directly impacts the well-being of its inhabitants, a patriotic person takes measures to protect and preserve natural resources. This can involve sustainable practices, conservation efforts, and a commitment to reducing one's ecological footprint.\n\n\n\nEducation and Knowledge\n\n\nPromoting education and knowledge is a patriotic act that invests in the future of a nation. By valuing learning, supporting educational initiatives, and encouraging intellectual curiosity, individuals contribute to the development of a knowledgeable and skilled population. A well-educated society is better equipped to face challenges and drive innovation, ensuring the continued progress of the nation.\n\n\n\nEconomic Contribution\n\n\nContributing to the economic prosperity of the country is an integral part of patriotism. This involves not only being a responsible consumer but also actively participating in the workforce. Whether through entrepreneurship, hard work, or innovation, individuals play a crucial role in building a robust and thriving economy that benefits everyone.\n\n\n\nNational Pride and Unity\n\n\nPatriotism fosters a sense of national pride and unity. This pride extends beyond individual accomplishments to a collective celebration of the achievements of the entire nation. It's about recognizing and highlighting what makes the country unique and exceptional, fostering a shared sense of identity that transcends individual differences.\n\n\n\nChallenges and Criticisms\n\n\nWhile patriotism is generally seen as a positive force, it is essential to acknowledge that blind nationalism and exclusionary practices can emerge if taken to extremes. A healthy patriotism embraces diversity and encourages open dialogue, recognizing that different perspectives contribute to the strength and resilience of a nation.\n\n\n\nPatriotism: A Historical Perspective\n\n\nAn essay on patriotism seems incomplete without delving into the historical context, particularly the role of freedom fighters. They are the heroes of times when the quest for freedom ignited the spirits of individuals who sought independence in economic, social, political, and cultural aspects.\n\n\n\nIndia's Patriots\n\n\nThe history of India’s freedom struggle shines through the immortal courage of heroic personalities like Veer Damodar Savarkar, Mahatma Gandhi, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru, Bhagat Singh, Chandra Shekhar Azad, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, and many more. These great patriots fought for the country and against the atrocities perpetrated on the countrymen.\n\n\n\nSinging slogans of ‘Vande Mataram’, ‘Bharat Mata ki Jai’, ‘Jay Hind’, these patriots went to the cross for the country with a smile on their faces and pride in their hearts. A very inspiring quote by Swami Vivekanand, says, “Do you love the country? Then, come, let us struggle for higher and better things; look not back, no, not even if you see the dearest and nearest cry. Look no back, but forward!”\n\n\n\nThe gist of Swami Vivekanand’s thought is that when you have started your journey on the path of the country’s welfare, then there must not be any looking back. All you need is to create a list of the priority things that you want to do for your country. Once you accomplish one thing just move ahead with the next one. The slogans like Jai Hind or Bharat Mata ki Jai work as your motivation on the path of doing something for the country. So, are you prepared to do something special for the nation?\n\n\n\nPatriotism in Different Roles\n\n\nPeople express their patriotism in different ways and in different roles. Soldiers, scientists, doctors, politicians, and other citizens express their patriotism through their hard work in their profession.\n\n\n\nIndian soldiers are role models for the youth of India. Highly scrupulous, positively secular, completely apolitical, with an ethos of working hard, simple needs and frugal habits, a soldier is the epitome of courage and unflinching devotion to the country.\n\n\n\nMangalyaan or Mars Orbiter Mission is one of the best examples of scientists' devotion toward the country. In the pandemic situation, the hardship of doctors and nurses proves their devotion towards their country.\n\n\n\nPatriotism does not always mean that you have to sacrifice your life for your country; contributing good service towards the country and its people is also equivalent to your sacrifice.\n\n\n\nMathunny Mathews has set a great example of patriotism. Mathews was an Indian, a resident in Kuwait, and was one of the people credited with the safe airlift evacuation of about 1, 70,000 Indians from Kuwait during the 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Only celebrating the flag hoisting ceremony on 15th August and 26th January, posing for photos with the flag, and posting on social media doesn’t imply that you are a true patriot. A real patriot is a person who has a true love for his country. He fights against the atrocities upon his countrymen by insiders or outsiders of the country.\n\n\n\nPatriotism by Freedom Fighters\n\n\nAn essay on patriotism seems incomplete without the mention of freedom fighters. They are the heroes of the times when we all wanted to get freedom. We all need freedom in economic, social, political, and cultural aspects. These were the people who did not give a second thought before offering complete sacrifice to stay in a free country.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\nPatriotism is a simple yet profound celebration of love for our country. It encompasses a range of sentiments, from appreciation of the land and culture to a commitment to individual responsibility and civic duty. Patriotism is not a static concept; it evolves as societies grow and change. By embodying the principles of patriotism in our daily lives, we contribute to the collective well-being of our nation, ensuring a brighter future for generations to come. In the end, patriotism is about recognizing the beauty in our shared journey and working together to build a stronger, more united society. Explore the meaning of patriotism, its significance, and the diverse ways in which people express their love for their country. Learn about the role of patriotism in the lives of individuals, from freedom fighters to modern-day citizens, and understand how it contributes to the development of a nation.\n"

          "explanation": "\nThe world is losing most of its natural resources as and when you read this. There are many factors which are making this happen, however, one major concern is that of deforestation. Human activities are resulting in deforestation at a very rapid rate. Moreover, the effects of this activity are very dangerous. We do not realize the damage we are causing to living beings as well as the vegetation by cutting down trees. It will be clearer if we understand the impact of deforestation and make attempts to prevent it.\n\nImpact of Deforestation\nWhen we cut down even a single tree, the impact it has is huge. Now imagine if we clear out whole forests only altogether, how damaging would that be. We cut down forests to meet the needs of humans. In order to fulfill the agricultural, commercial, industrial, residential and other needs we remove forests. Most of the earth was covered with forests until a hundred years ago, however, now we don’t have much of them left.\nDeforestation causes disruption in the ecological balance. Moreover, it also interferes with the lives of wildlife and human beings as well. Firstly, when there won’t be many forests left, the water cycle of the earth will get disturbed. There won’t be enough trees left to absorb the water. Moreover, it will cause floods and droughts too. Similarly, soil erosion will be another effect of deforestation.\nOther than that, the climate will experience massive change. Global warming is also happening partly due to deforestation only. The oxygen level in the atmosphere will drop down by a great number and thus naturally carbon dioxide levels will increase. Most importantly, the wildlife is losing their habitats due to deforestation. Forests are their only home and with no place left to go, they either lose their lives or wreak havoc in the cities.\nTherefore, we must all come together to stop this from happening and saving our earth as well as our lives. Humans must not be so selfish so as to make other animals homeless to shelter themselves. We must not damage our vegetation to create a beautiful garden for ourselves.\nHow to Prevent Deforestation?\nWe can do a lot of things that will contribute to preventing deforestation. To begin with, do not waste paper. The more demand there will be the more supply will happen. This way, trees will keep getting cut to meet these needs.\nSimilarly, the government must put a ban on deforestation so the big firms can find other alternatives instead of clearing forests for commercial and industrial needs. The laws must be made stringent enough and also implemented properly to prevent it.\nMoreover, there must be measures taken to control the increasing population. As there are more mouths to feed and fewer resources, our nature and forests are getting burdened. There is not adequate supply to meet the ever-increasing demands of the population. Thus, the lesser the demand, the better the conditions of the forests as well."

Many people begin to use internet as a means to overcome loneliness and boredom and get addicted to it within no time.\n\nIntroduction of Smart Phones Responsible for Growing Internet Addiction\nAround a decade back when internet could only be accessed on desktop and laptop, the internet usage was limited. Many people were still addicted to it. They spent several hours in front of their systems surfing internet. Many people frequently visited cyber cafes to access internet. However, the situation wasn’t as bad as it is today.\nThe introduction of smart phones has given internet access to large number of people. Smart phones are said to be one of the major causes of internet addiction in today’s times. People are seen glued to internet even as they travel or attend a social event. Some of them are obsessed with chatting apps, others are addicted to gaming while yet others are busy updating and checking their social media accounts.\nThe introduction of various kinds of web series has increased internet addiction. It is an easy source of entertainment and extremely addictive. Binge watching web series is quite common among people around the world. Internet addicts forget to eat, complete important tasks, and ignore their loved ones. All they want is a high speed internet connection and a device to access it. This is straining their personal relationships and hampering their work.\nConclusion\nInternet addiction is a serious disorder that blurs a person’s ability to think rationally. Even though internet addicts know the harmful consequences of this addiction and begin to feel the heat they do not make much effort to overcome it.

Smartphones have undoubtedly brought about significant changes in how we communicate, work, and interact with the world. However, while they offer numerous benefits, there are also serious drawbacks associated with their widespread use. Below, I will compare and contrast both the positive and negative impacts of smartphones to assess whether they have done us more harm than good.\nBenefits of Smartphones\n1. Improved Communication: One of the most significant advantages of smartphones is the way they have revolutionized communication. They allow us to stay connected with people from anywhere in the world, whether through calls, text messages, social media, or video conferencing. This ease of communication has bridged geographical gaps and helped maintain relationships, both personally and professionally.\n2. Access to Information: Smartphones have put vast amounts of information at our fingertips. With internet access, we can look up anything from news and research to how-to guides and educational content. This instant access to knowledge has empowered people to learn new skills, make informed decisions, and stay updated on global events.\n3. Convenience and Efficiency: Smartphones have made many tasks more convenient and efficient. With apps for banking, shopping, navigation, and work, they enable us to accomplish daily tasks quickly and with ease. For example, mobile banking allows people to transfer money, pay bills, or check their accounts without having to visit a bank.\n4. Entertainment and Socialization: Smartphones provide a wide variety of entertainment options, including movies, music, games, and social media platforms. They allow people to stay entertained during commutes or in moments of downtime, and they have created new avenues for social interaction, especially through social networks and messaging apps.\n5. Work Flexibility: With smartphones, many people can work remotely, check emails, manage projects, and attend meetings without being tied to an office. This has increased workplace flexibility, which is especially valuable for people with busy schedules or those who live in remote areas.\nDrawbacks of Smartphones\n1. Health Issues: Prolonged smartphone use has been linked to various health problems. Excessive screen time can lead to eye strain, headaches, and disrupted sleep patterns due to blue light exposure. Additionally, the sedentary lifestyle promoted by constant smartphone usage contributes to physical health issues such as obesity, poor posture, and back problems.\n2. Addiction and Dependency: Smartphones can be addictive. Many people find it hard to go a few hours without checking their phones, leading to reduced productivity and social isolation. The constant notifications and the desire for instant gratification through social media can foster an unhealthy dependency, impacting mental health by causing anxiety, stress, and depression.\n3. Privacy Concerns: With smartphones constantly connected to the internet, they are vulnerable to cyberattacks, hacking, and data breaches. Personal information, such as location data, contacts, and browsing history, can be exploited by malicious entities. Privacy concerns are particularly pronounced with the increasing use of smartphones for online transactions, banking, and shopping.\n4. Distraction and Reduced Attention Span: Smartphones are a significant source of distraction, especially in environments that require focus, such as the workplace or school. Constant notifications and the lure of social media apps can make it difficult to concentrate on important tasks, leading to reduced productivity. Studies have shown that smartphone use is also shortening attention spans, as people tend to multitask and switch between activities rapidly.\n5. Social Isolation: While smartphones enable communication, they can also contribute to social isolation. People may opt for texting or messaging instead of face-to-face interactions, leading to a reduction in meaningful, personal connections. This \"virtual connection\" often lacks the depth and quality of in-person relationships, contributing to feelings of loneliness and alienation.\nConclusion\nWhile smartphones offer numerous benefits that enhance our lives, from improving communication and access to information to making our daily tasks more convenient, they also come with significant drawbacks. The negative impacts—such as health problems, addiction, privacy concerns, and social isolation—highlight that the overuse of smartphones can be harmful.\nIn my opinion, whether smartphones have done us more harm than good depends on how they are used. If used mindfully, with proper boundaries and awareness of their potential downsides, smartphones can be powerful tools for personal and professional growth. However, if used excessively or irresponsibly, they can lead to harmful consequences. Ultimately, it is essential to strike a balance and use smartphones in a way that maximizes their benefits while minimizing their drawbacks."

          "explanation": "Adulteration of Foodstuff: Causes and Consequences\nAdulteration of foodstuff refers to the practice of intentionally adding harmful, low-quality, or synthetic substances to food items in order to increase profits. It is a serious issue that affects public health and undermines consumer trust. Adulterated food is often cheaper to produce but can pose significant health risks to those who consume it unknowingly.\nCauses of Food Adulteration\nOne of the primary causes of food adulteration is the economic motive behind it. Sellers and manufacturers may use adulterants to increase the quantity or shelf life of food products, thereby reducing costs. For example, low-quality or artificial substances are often added to increase the weight of spices, grains, or beverages. This is especially common in the case of products like milk, tea, sugar, and edible oils.\nThe lack of stringent regulations and enforcement also contributes to the prevalence of food adulteration. In many countries, food safety laws are not strictly implemented, allowing unscrupulous traders to exploit gaps in the system. In some cases, poor awareness among consumers about food safety and quality standards makes it easier for adulterated food to enter the market without detection.\nAnother significant cause is the greed of certain manufacturers and traders. In their quest for higher profits, they compromise on quality and safety. For instance, chemicals, artificial colorants, and preservatives are added to food items like fruits, vegetables, and sweets to make them look fresh and appealing, despite the potential health risks they pose.\nConsequences of Food Adulteration\nThe consequences of food adulteration are severe and can have both short-term and long-term effects on health. Immediate reactions to consuming adulterated food can include food poisoning, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which can be particularly dangerous for children and the elderly.\nLong-term consumption of adulterated food can lead to chronic health problems, such as liver and kidney damage, cancer, and reproductive issues. For instance, the addition of harmful chemicals like formalin in fish or milk can lead to severe health complications over time. The accumulation of toxic substances in the body can weaken the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to diseases.\nIn addition to health risks, food adulteration also leads to economic losses for consumers. People pay for food products that are often less nutritious or potentially harmful. This can cause financial strain, especially in lower-income communities where access to safe food is already limited.\nMoreover, food adulteration damages the reputation of businesses and industries that rely on consumer trust. Once a brand is associated with adulterated food, it can lose its customers and face legal consequences, leading to long-term financial losses.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, food adulteration is a harmful practice with far-reaching consequences. The causes are multifaceted, including economic motives, lack of regulation, and consumer ignorance. The effects on health and the economy are undeniable, making it imperative for governments to enforce strict food safety regulations and for consumers to remain vigilant. Only through collective efforts can we ensure that the food we consume is safe, nutritious, and free from harmful adulterants."

          "explanation": "ICT Stands for \"Information and Communication Technologies.\" It refers to technologies that provide access to information through telecommunications. It is defined as a diverse set of technological tools and resources used to communicate, and to create, disseminate, store, and manage information. At present it has created a \"global village,\" in which people can communicate with others across the world as if they were living next door. For this reason, ICT is often studied in the context of how modern communication technologies affect society.\nIn the 21st century, Information Communication Technology (ICT) is one of the latest techniques around the world including Bangladesh to use in the field of education. In Bangladesh information and communications technology has been introduced as a compulsory subject at the junior secondary, secondary and higher secondary level. In line with the education policy 2010, the government introduced ICT for Class VI students in 2012, for Class VII in 2013, for Class Vill in 2014 and for Class IX in 2015. For the students of Class XI and XII, ICT subject was introduced in 2013.\nStudents would now be studying the ICT as a compulsory subject in addition to Bangla and English. The subject gives the students primary ideas about computer and its related devices, internet, mobile and their usages, which builds a foundation for further ICT studies. In Bangladesh, there is no alternative to compulsory ICT education. It can improve the quality of our life because it can be used as a learning and education media, the mass communication media in promoting and campaigning practical and important issues, such as the health and social area. It provides wider knowledge and can help in gaining and accessing information.\nMoreover, we live in the digital age. The age requires a technologically competent work force. If our education systems fail to produce a technically literate population, it will hinder our ability to compete in the global economy. 21st century is completely technology driven since the people around the world do not think their life without technology. Those who have the technology they are developed and control the whole world so far. That is why, compulsory ICT education has no alternative. We hope, it will pave the way to producing the skilled, efficient and trained manpower. No doubt, it will be helpful for the students to cope with the challenges of the 21st century."

          "explanation": "Impact of Climate Change in Bangladesh\nLong-term variation in temperatures and weather patterns is known as climate change. The frequent\nshift of climate in Bangladesh has been showing a number of devastating effects, such as, rising sea level, floods and intensifying cyclones, Firstly, Rising sea level is a growing threat to people all around Bangladesh. To illustrate, Two-thirds of the land of this country is less than fifteen feet above sea level. So, the increase of sea level might cause extinction of huge low land area, Respondingly, The dwellers of the area may have to migrate from their own land. Secondly, Climate change is making rainfall more erratic and often far more intense. In terms of Bangladesh, this reality has recently become quite evident, Because of irregular rain and melting the Himalayan glaciers, Bangladesh is now far more vulnerable to devastating floods, Lastly and more importantly, The Bay of Bangal narrows towards its northern shore where it meets the south of coast Bangladesh. This narrowing can both direct cyclones towards Bangladesh's coast and make them more intense. To conclude, to minimize climate change, some immediate steps could be taken such as planting more trees, reducing the use of CFC gases, using electric vehicles, recycling plastic materials, In a word, People should practice eco-friendly behaviors to protect the nature as well as themselves.\n\n"

Though our main duty is to study hard, we also have a responsibility to help others in need.\nThere are many problems in our communities that we can try to solve through social work. Many people in villages and slums are uneducated. During holidays, we students can go to these areas to teach basic reading and writing. We can start makeshift schools under trees to educate both children and adults. Knowledge is power, and education can uplift their lives.\nPoverty is also widespread across Bangladesh. We can encourage self-sufficiency by teaching vocational skills like sewing, farming, and small business management. We can work with microfinance organizations to help villagers take small loans to start their own enterprises. Financial independence can alleviate their hardship.\nHealth awareness is lacking, especially among the poor. We can educate people about cleanliness, nutrition, vaccinations, and preventive care. Girls can be especially effective in teaching women about maternal health, childcare and women’s rights. We can also run free health camps for checkups and medicine distribution.\nSome regions face problems like water scarcity. We can mobilize resources to build wells and set up water filters to provide clean drinking water. We can teach sustainable practices like rainwater harvesting that people can implement themselves. Ensuring water access can greatly improve quality of life.\nWhen floods, cyclones and other disasters hit Bangladesh, students can jump into action as volunteers. We can collect food, clothes and medicine to distribute to affected families. We can also directly participate in response efforts by helping evacuate people, setting up shelters, and providing emergency medical aid.\nAs youth, we represent progress, compassion and social justice. Every small effort we make improves our communities. The young generation has energy and inspiration that is vital for national development. Through continued education and service, we can create solutions and uplift our nation. We, the students of today, will lead Bangladesh towards prosperity tomorrow."
