          "explanation": "In the case of variable++, the compiler first uses the old value of variable in the program, and then increments the value of the variable by one. This new value becomes effective from the next statement step. But in the case of ++variable, the compiler first increments the initial value of variable by one, and then the program uses this increased value in the same statement. So variable++ and ++variable are not the same."

          "explanation": "In asynchronous transmission, Start bit and Stop bit are used. The main reason is to identify the start and end of the data. In this case, when the receiver computer gets the Start bit at the beginning, it understands that the character data bits have started coming and accordingly it starts its internal clock pulse. On the other hand, when it gets the Stop bit, the receiver computer understands that the character data bits have ended. Since the Start bit and Stop bit are essential in this data transfer process, this transmission is also called start-stop transmission."

The features of the fourth generation phone are given below- This generation of mobile phones can use ultra-broadband speed internet in the system. The actual data transfer rate is a maximum of 20 Mbps The main feature of this generation of mobile system is the use of Internet Protocol (IP) based network instead of circuit switching or packet switching.

          "question": "Between the head office and the new office, which one would be suitable for network connection, IEEE 802-11 or IEEE 802-16? Analyze.",
          "explanation": "IEEE 802.11 is the Wi-Fi standard. On the other hand, IEEE 802.16 is the Wi-Max standard. Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity) is a high-speed, popular networking system that transmits data through wireless technology, connecting multiple devices over short distances. It is a wireless local area network (WLAN) technology, with a coverage area typically limited to 50 to 200 meters. It is relatively faster and less expensive than Ethernet and other traditional wired LAN technologies. However, one of its major drawbacks is its limited coverage area, making it difficult to access outside of a specific area. Additionally, it has higher security risks and can experience network signal jams when many users are connected at the same time. On the other hand, 'Wi-MAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) is a modern, high-speed broadband internet service that provides fast internet access over a wide geographic area through a wireless system. Its coverage area can range from 10 to 50 kilometers. However, under certain conditions, its coverage area can extend up to 60 kilometers. WiMAX can provide high-speed broadband internet services to many more users over long distances. Although its maintenance cost is relatively high, it is a highly effective wireless networking system for providing high-speed internet services over a wide range. Therefore, it can be said that using the IEEE 802.16 standard would be suitable for networking between Mr. Mamun's head office and new office."

As a result, healthy cells are protected, the efficacy of the medication increases, and side effects are reduced.

          "question": "When Mr. Rafiq stood in front of the door, it opened, but when Shafiq pushed it, the door didn't open. Explain why.",
          "explanation": "As soon as Mr. Rafiq stood in front of the door, it opened, but when Shafiq put his hand on it, the door did not open and the alarm went off, because the door is controlled by a biometric security system. The main reasons are explained here: Mr. Rafiq's biometric data is registered in the system: The door scanned Mr. Rafiq's biometric information (possibly his iris or face) and identified him. This means that the biometric data required to open the door is only registered or \"enrolled\" in the system for Mr. Rafiq. Shafiq's biometric data is not registered: Shafiq's biometric information (such as fingerprints or fingerprints) is not registered in that security system. When Shafiq puts his hand on the door, the system scans his biometric information and fails to match it with the registered data. The alarm goes off: Since Shafiq's biometric data was not registered and he tried to open the door, the system considered it an unauthorized access attempt. Therefore, the alarm went off according to the security protocol, which is a part of the protection. In simple terms, the door only allows access to the person whose biometric information is loaded into the system as authorized. Mr. Rafiq is an authorized user, but Shafiq is not."

          "explanation": "The technology of discovering the ufshi rice in the cue is genetic engineering. The method of working of the technology is described below— 1. DNA selection: The DNA carrying the desired trait of the plant is selected. 2. DNA carrier selection: E. coli is selected as a carrier to carry the selected DNA. It is used to attach the DNA to the plasmid of the carrier. 3. DNA fragmentation: The selected DNA is cut into a convenient DNA part using a specific restriction enzyme. 4. Replacement of fragmented DNA: The fragmented DNA is replaced in the plasmid DNA by applying the ligase enzyme. The modified plasmid DNA is called recombinant. 5. Transfer of recombinant DNA to the host body: The recombinant DNA molecule is introduced into the host bacterium by creating a favorable environment. This DNA-accepting bacterium is called a transformed bacterium. 6. Increase and evaluation of recombinant DNA: The recombinant DNA bacterium is kept in a culture medium and the number is increased. At this time, the desired gene-carrying plasmid also increases the number of host cells. Thus, a large number of recombinant DNA are created in the host body. The contribution of genetic engineering technology in the field of agriculture - through genetic engineering technology, the seedlings of all the plants that do not spread through seeds can be created and transferred in a fresh state, easily produce disease-free, especially virus-free seedlings, produce and conserve endangered plants and reliable technology for tissue culture and free from the problem of proper seed collection and storage, and transferring a gene from a wild species to another crop species to produce more productive crops, etc."

In the linear web structure, the pages are arranged in a specific sequence (one after the other). The user has to click on the 'Next' or 'Previous' button to move from one page to another in a sequential manner. On the other hand, in the menu structure, there is a menu or navigation bar where there are options to go directly to different sections or questions of the quiz. This is usually part of a hierarchical structure, where one can go to different sections from the home page. Since the quiz competition has more freedom for the authorities to conduct and less freedom for the competitors, the user is taken on a specific path and the user is forced to answer each question sequentially, so it can be said that the linear structure is better for quiz competitions. A detailed analysis is given below- The linear structure is better for quiz competitions for the following reasons- There is only a \"Next\" or 'Previous' option, so navigation is very easy for the user. There is no confusion. Due to the absence of any extra menu or option for the user, there is less confusion and they can focus completely on the quiz. If the quiz is an exam or assessment where each question must be answered, the linear structure is the most suitable. The menu structure is not suitable for quiz competitions for the following reasons- It can be difficult to ensure that each question is seen in the correct order during the quiz. If the menu is too complex or has many options, the user may become confused. If the quiz is time-limited or requires continuity (such as in the case of an exam), the menu structure may not be suitable."
