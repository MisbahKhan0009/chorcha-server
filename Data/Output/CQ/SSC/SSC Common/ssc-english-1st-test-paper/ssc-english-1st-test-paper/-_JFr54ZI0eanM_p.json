But they can control the increase in the amount of greenhouse gases and its effect on the atmosphere. Only during-the last hundred years the carbon dioxide concentration has been raised alarmingly in the atmosphere and we humans can be held responsible for this. The main cause of the increase in carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels. Since the end of the 19th century, industrial activities increased rapidly giving rise to many factories. These factories required energy, which was produced through the combustion of coal. Besides coal, other sources of energy such as mineral oil and natural gas were also burned to heat our houses, run cars and airplanes or to produce electricity. Nowadays, about 85 million barrels of crude oil are burned daily. Every time a fossil raw material is burned, it releases carbon dioxide into the air. Therefore, it is clear that more and more greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide are being generated worldwide by humans. Moreover, we are also strengthening the greenhouse effect by deforestation, which means cutting down trees. Every year enormous areas of forests are destroyed by people to obtain wood and to clear regions for mining and to create pasture. This loss of the forest causes dual problems. Trees that are burned up release a large volumes of carbon dioxide gas into the air. On the other hand, an important carbon dioxide storehouse is destroyed with the forests as forests absorb a lot of carbon dioxide from the air and deliver oxygen instead. We also destroy important storehouse of carbon dioxide when we clear forests.\nChoose the correct answer from the alternatives.",

          "explanation": "Once there lived a poor rickshaw puller. He had to maintain his family consisting 'of eight members with great difficulty. One day while walking through the fields, he found a purse dropped by a passer-by. He picked the purse up and found a lot of money in it.

I should look for the owner.\" The next day, the rickshaw puller was waiting in that place where he found the purse thinking that the owner might come in search of it. After a long time, he noticed a man looking for something. The rickshaw puller rushed to the man and came to know that the purse belonged to him. He took the man to his home and handed over the bag.

I think it would be better if you got yourself admitted into a college in the city as I did.\nNehal: I don't think so, Ritu. Actually, I don't like cities.\nRitu: Why? What're the things of city life you dislike?\nNehal: I think, life in the city is very artificial. People lead a very busy life there. They get up in the morning hearing the noises of motor vehicles, machines and factories.\nRitu: You're right. But there are many modern facilities that you can have only in cities. Good educational institutes, hospitals and clinics are mainly available in the city. Again, there are many spots for recreations.\nNehal: That's true. But I think life in the village is far better than that of the town. Village life is quite natural. People lead a very simple life. They wake up from sleep hearing the chirping ofthe birds and can breathe in fresh air. Do you have fresh fish in the town?\nRitu: Actually, fishes are available there, but not fresh.\nNehal: But fresh food, fishes, vegetables, fruits etc. are available in the village. Moreover, village life is pollution free.\nRitu : You're right. But village life is not without its disadvantages. Disease, hunger, malnutrition and poverty arè common in the life of the villagers. Also, jobs are not available here.\nNehal: Hmm. Actually, both lives have their advantages and disadvantages. I think a balanced development can remove the gap between these two types of life.\nRitu: Yes. I agree with you. See you later.\nNehal: Ok, bye. Take a good, care of yourself."
