      "uddipok": "Mother Teresa was moved by the sight of the sick and dying on the streets of Kolkata. She founded a home for the dying destitute and named it \"Nirmal Hriday\", meaning \"Pure Heart\". She and her fellow nuns gathered the dying people of the streets of Kolkata and brought them to this home. They were lovingly looked after and cared for. Since then men, women and children have been taken from the streets and carried to Nirmal Hriday. These unloved and uncared for people get an opportunity to die in an environment of kindness and love. In their last hours they get human and divine love, and can feel they are also children of God. Those who survive, the Missionaries of Charity try to find jobs for them or send them to homes where they can live happily for some more years in a caring environment. Regarding commitment to family, Mother Teresa said, \"May be in our own family, we have somebody, who is feeling lonely, who is feeling sick, who is feeling worried, are we there? Are we willing to give until it hurts in order to be with our families, or do we put our interest first? We must remember that love begins at home and we must also remember that future of humanity passes through the family.\" Mother Teresa's work has been recognised thought the world and she has received a number of awards. These include the Pope John XXIII Peace Prize (1971), the Nehru Prize for Promotion of International Peace and Understanding (1972), the Balzan Prize (1978), the Nobel Peace Prize (1979) and the Bharat Ratna, (1980). Mother Teresa died at the age of 87, on 5 September 1997. The world salutes her for her love and compassion for humanity. She has taught us how to extend our hand towards those who need our love and support irrespective of creed, caste and religion.

          "explanation": "A Winter Morning\nA winter morning has its own exceptional natural aspects as well as its effects on human and animal life. A winter morning is misty and cold. There is dense fog everywhere. Sometimes, the fog is so dense that the sun-rays cannot get through it. Everything looks hazy. The scenery of a winter morning is really charming in rural areas. Dewdrops on grass and leaves sparkle like pearls in the sunrays. Generally, people wake up late in the morning. They shiver in cold. They wear warm clothes. Old people and children are found basking in the morning sun. People usually have date juice and various native 'pithas' as breakfast. Cattle remain in their sheds. However, in cities, a winter morning does not make much change in life as it is not too cold there. People wake up at their usual time, wear colourful warm clothes and go to their work place. Students are seen in the most colourful warm clothes. The nature is dull and gloomy here, too. Both in rural and urban areas, poor people are the worst sufferers. They do not have enough warm clothes to protect themselves from the biting cold. Street children gather straw and papers and make fire to warm themselves. The communication system is disrupted which causes much hardship to the people. However, the scenery of a winter morning is very transitory. It starts disappearing as the day advances. My personal feeling about a winter morning is that it is a bane for the poor, but a boon for the rich."

At last, he saw a jar. He peeped into the jar and saw that there was a little water at the bottom of the jar. He tried to drink water but his bill could not reach it. He tried again and again but in vain. He became very sad and hopeless. Suddenly, he saw some small pieces of stone near the jar. A good idea came into his head. He picked up the stones and dropped them into the jar one by one. As a result, the water came up to the brim. The crow then drank water from it to his heart's content and flew away with a joyful mind."

He was an active worker of the Language Movement. He was one of the ten students to go out in a procession on 21 . February 1952 despite a ban on such activities imposed by the authorities. As a result, he and many others were arrested and taken to prison. Zahir was also present at the historical meeting of Amtala on 21 February 1952. He also took part in the mass movement in 1969. In 1971, he joined the Liberation War.\nAll through his life, Zahir Raihan dreamt of a democratic society, a society that will ensure freedom of speech and will. He had many dreams about our film industry too. He made a legendary film 'Jibon Theke Neya' based on the Language Movement of 1952. It was a revolt against the autocratic government. The family presented in that film was a miniature East Pakistan ruled by an autocrat who had to go to prison for her conspiracy. During the Liberation War, this film was shown outside Bangladesh. Celebrated filmmakers like Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, and Ritwik Ghatak appreciated the film. Zahir gave all the money to the Freedom Fighters' trust that he get from his film shows. Besides, his great documentary on Pakistani atrocities, 'Stop Genocide', helped create world sentiment in favour of our liberation war.\nOn 30 December 1971, someone informed Zahir about an address somewhere at Mirpur, where he might find his brother, the famous writer Shahidullah Kaiser. Shahidullah was captured and killed by the Pakistani army and the local collaborators during the last days of the war. Accordingly, Zahir left home to get his brother back but he never returned. Zahir's dream was fulfilled. He could see the inception of a free independent Bangladesh though he did not get back his brother. And it's a pity that this dreamer was missing at such a time when his dream came true.",
