We can talk to a person thousands of kilometres away on the phone or the Internet. So, we can communicate with the whole world easily. English has made this communication easier.\n\nThere are many countries in the world with many languages, but to communicate with them, you cannot use all the languages. So, you need a common language that you can use with more or less all the people in the world. English is that common language. You can talk to a Chinese toy maker, a French artist, an Arab ambassador or a Korean builder in one language - English.\n\nEnglish for us in Bangladesh is all the more important. As we have seen earlier, we are too many people in a small country. So, if you learn English, you have the best opportunity to find a good job, both within and outside the country. And that is good news for millions of our unemployed youths.\" \"But Miss, we learn English for 12 or 14 years, yet we do not find good jobs\", says Rumi. She then tells the class about what happened to her brother. \"Could you please tell us why?\" Rumi asks. \"This is a very important question, Rumi: We should learn how to use English both orally and in writing for doing things as needed in our work, such as communicating with others at personal, social, national and international levels. But unfortunately, at the moment we are learning English mainly for our exams,\" continues Miss Choudhury. \"Remember, English can greatly help you become skilled workers.\"\n\n\"But where and how can we learn this kind of English, Miss?\" asks Ratan. Ms Choudhury says, \"We can learn English both in ánd outside the classroom. Besides your textbooks, the radio, television, newspapers, magazines, computers and other supplementary materials will greatly help you. During our classroom activities, we'll see how we can learn English.\"\nMatch the parts of the sentences in column A A A , column B B B and column C C C to write four complete sentences.\nColumn A\nColumn B\nColumn C\n(a) Nowadays we can communicate\n(i) to get a good job both inside and outside the country\n(i) and that is English\n(b) But the language\n(ii) with a person living anywhere in the world\n(ii) by learning English\n(c) To communicate with anyone living anywhere\n(iii) is not the same\n(iii) on the phone or the internet\n(d) One can have an opportunity\n(iv) we need a common language\n(iv) in all the countries",

A school library is only for the teachers and the students of a school. We have an up-to-date library in our school. It is housed in a separate one-storey building. It is quite spacious and well-ventilated. The books are arranged systemically in different bookshelves. So, we have no difficulty in finding out the expected books. Our school library has a good collection of text and reference books. It has also books on different branches of knowledge like literature, history, science, commerce, geography, travels, biography and so on. Besides, it has a good supply of newspapers, magazines and journals. Moreover, there is a librarian in charge of our school library. He is well-trained, qualified and experienced. Every student has a library card. We can borrow two books at a time. Nobody is allowed to keep a book for more than two weeks. In the library; discipline and silence is strictly maintained. While studying in the reading room, students are strictly prohibited to talk or disturb others in any way. The calm and quiet atmosphere of the library helps the students to work attentively. Our school library plays an important role in enriching both our academic and general knowledge. It provides us with the opportunity to read different types of books. To us, it is a storehouse of knowledge. I think, every educational institution should have a library. To conclude it can be said that no educational institute is a complete one without a library.\n"

They told Rimi to remain careful and also assured that they would come back before evening. She thought of making a good use of her lonely time. She was fond of reading adventurous stories and so started reading one. Suddenly, she heard a sound outside. Someone was knocking at the door and crying out for help. It was raining in torrents, and Rimi wondered who would go out on a day like this. At first, she got scared that her own safety might be at stake. But after listening more carefully, she realized that it was only a child who needed help. She opened the door and found a little girl not more than 7 / 8 7 / 8 7/8 years old standing there all drenched in rain and shivering in cold. Rimi's heart sank seeing the little girl in distress and she let her in. After taking care of the girl, Rimi asked what had happened to her. The girl took a while to get back to a composed state and slowly started talking. She along with her mother just arrived in Dhaka to visit her sick father. When they arrived at Sadarghat, the little girl lost her mother in the crowd. Since then, she had been looking for her mother and out of exhaustion, decided to seek shelter where Rimi lived. Rimi felt pity for the little girl. When Rimi's parents returned home, Rimi told them about the little girl's miserable condition. So, they all went to the nearby police station and asked the officers to help find the girl's parents. The police assured that they would take care of the girl and then they took her in their custody. After being confirmed that the police would inform Rimi's parents if the girl could be reunited' with her parents, they left the police station. Two days later, the police inspector called Rimi's father saying that they found the girl's parents. Finally, Rimi felt relieved that the girl was then in safe hands."

          "explanation": "The pie chart shows the subject preferences of students in a secondary school. It highlights their interest in four key subjects: Mathematics, Science, Bangla, and English. According to the chart, Mathematics is the most preferred subject, with 35% of the students showing interest in it. This is followed by Science, which attracts 25% of the students. Bangla is also popular, drawing the attention of 23% of the students. English, however, is the least chosen subject, with only 17% showing interest in it.\nFrom the data, it is clear that students tend to favor subjects related to logic and reasoning, such as Mathematics and Science, over languages. This could be due to the growing importance of science and technology in modern education and career paths. Nonetheless, the significant interest in Bangla reflects a continued appreciation for the mother tongue. Overall, the chart shows a balanced but slightly science-leaning academic interest among students."

          "explanation": "a. February 21 is a memorable day in our national history because on this day in 1952, the heroic son's of Bengal laid down their lives to establish Bangla as a state language of the undivided Pakistan. On this day, we pay tribute to the language martyrs because of their sacrifice for the rightful place of mother tongue.\nb. The then Governor General of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Zinnah, is responsible to raise a storm of protest. In a public meeting in Dhaka, he declared Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan, which disregarded the language rights of the Bangalee. Therefore, a mass protest started across the country.\nc. The Pakistani government banned all sorts of public meetings and gatherings to stop the protest that began following Mohammad Ali Jinnah's declaration of Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan and continued non-stop.\nd. Against the declaration of outlawing all sorts of public meeting and rallies, the students of Dhaka University brought out a peaceful protest procession on 21 February, defying the law.\ne. The Language Movement of 1952 kindled the sparks of independence movement in East Pakistan by making the Bangalees aware of their rights. Thus, the Language Movement is related to the independence movement of Bangladesh."
