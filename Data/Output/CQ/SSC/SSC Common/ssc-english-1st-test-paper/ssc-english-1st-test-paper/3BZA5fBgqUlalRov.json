      "uddipok": "Mark Zuckerberg is co-founder and CEO of the social networking website Facebook, as well as one of the world's youngest billionaires. Mark Elliot Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York, into a comfortable, well-educated family, and raised in the nearby village of Dobbs Ferry. His father, Edward Zuckerberg, ran a dental practice attached to the family's home. His mother, Karen, worked as a psychiatrist before the birth of the couple's four children Mark, Pandi, Donna and Arielle. Zuckerberg developed an interest in computers at an early age. When he was about 12, he used Atari BASIC to create a messaging programme he named \"Zucknet'. His father used the programme in his dental office. Zuckerberg later studied at Phillips Exeter Academy, an exclusive preparatory school in New Hampshire. There he showed talent in fencing, becoming the captain of the school's team. He also excelled in literature, earning a diploma in classics. Yet Zuckerberg remained fascinated by computers, and continued to work on developing new programmes. While still in high school, he created an early version of the music software Pandora, which he called Synapse. Several companies - including AOL and Microsoft- expressed an interest in buying the software, and hiring the teenager before graduation. He declined the offers.\nWrite a summary of the above passage in your own words.",

          "explanation": "Tree Plantation\nTree plantation means planting trees on a large scale in a planned way. Trees are our friends. They give us shade and soothe our eyes with their green colour. They give us various kinds of fruits. They give us firewood as fuel for cooking. They give us timber for furniture, doors and windows, boats, electric poles, railway slippers, etc. They give us rubber too. Trees take in carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. Sufficient trees cause sufficient rainfall and prevent draught. Trees along the roadside and coastal areas preyent erosion and tidal bore. But many inconsiderate pcople are cutting down trees for their selfish interests. So, we are losing trees. If there is no tree, there will be no civilization. In fact, the loss of trees will take our existence to the verge of extinction. The earth will be no more habitable. Hence, tree plantation must be taken as a project. The more we plant trees, the morė our environment will be balanced and greener. In Bangladesh, tree plantation is compulsory because we do not have as much forest as we require to maintain the ecological balance. There is no specific time to plant trees. We can plant trees any time of the year based on the type of the trees. Park, yard, urban areas, open field, balcony, rooftops; roadside places, etc. are best places to plant trees. To make life peaceful, there is no alternative to tree plantation."

Suddenly his mother woke up and told him to give her a glass of water. But he found that there was no water in the house.\n\nWithout any hesitation, Bayazid took the water pot and went out in search of water. It was a dark and cold night, and everyone was asleep. He walked a long distance to the nearest well. After collecting the water, he hurried back home. But when he reached home, he saw that his mother had fallen asleep again.\n\nBayazid did not want to wake her up. So, he stood beside her bed with the glass of water in his hand. He remained standing the whole night, waiting patiently for his mother to wake up. When his mother opened her eyes in the morning, she was surprised to see Bayazid standing with the glass of water. Tears came to her eyes, and she hugged her son with love.\n\nBayazid’s deep love and respect for his mother made him a great man later in life. His story continues to inspire children to honor and care for their pa\nrents."

          "explanation": "The chart provides the information about the minimum-temperature in Rajshahi and Chattogram in the years between 1997 and 2001. A picture of rise and fall in the temperature is noticed in the chart. In 1997, the minimum temperature in Rajshahi was 14 ∘ C 14^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} 1 4 ∘ C . For Chattogram it was only 8 ∘ C 8^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} 8 ∘ C . Next year (1998), the minimum temperature of Chattogram increased to 10 ∘ C 10^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} 1 0 ∘ C but it remained unchanged for Rajshahi. In 1999, a slight increase is noticed in the minimum temperature in both Rajshahi and Chattogram. This year the minimum temperature of Rajshahi increased to 15 ∘ C 15^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} 1 5 ∘ C which remained the same in 2000. On the other hand, in 1999, the minimum temperature of Chattogram increased to 11 ∘ C 11^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} 1 1 ∘ C , but in 2000 , it decreased to 10 ∘ C 10^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} 1 0 ∘ C . Finally in 2001, the minimum temperature decreased in both the regions. The bar of 2001 shows that the mipimum temperature in Rajshahi was 12 ∘ C 12^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} 1 2 ∘ C and in Chattogram it was 9 ∘ C 9^{\\circ} \\mathrm{C} 9 ∘ C . So, overall the graph illustrates that both the regions experienced fluctuation in terms. of temperature measurement."
