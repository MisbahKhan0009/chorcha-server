Last Sunday, I witnessed a tragic street accident. It took place near our school. There is a turning there. It is an interchange of five roads. Now and then, there occurs a traffic jam. On that day, while I was going to school, I saw a car coming from the western direction. A rickshaw, with a school boy and his mother, was coming from the opposite direction at about 8:30 a.m. While crossing the point, the car hit the rickshaw. The rickshawpuller was able to jump fróm his seat but the boy and his mother fell on the street. The boy and his mother were seriously wounded. I rushed to them. Some other passers-by also came forward to help them. We led them to a nearby doctor's chamber. I felt pity for the school boy, he was of my age. In fact, for having no traffic police at that place, such accidents frequently occur. The authority should take steps to stop road accidents that very often claim peoples' lives."

One day, while she was busy in work, a sound was heard, \"Fire! Fire! Help! Help! As ill news runs apace, the news spread very fast, among the workers. But no one noticed whether there was actually any fire or not. Having just heard the news, without any confirmation, all the workers of the factory became desperate to come outside.\nBut the factory had only one exit and the path which led to this gate was very narrow. Even three men or women could not pass through this path side by side at a time. So, when all the workers of the factory were trying to come out along this narrow path, the path became congested with the workers. Many workers fell down on the path because of the jostling in the crowd and were trampled by other workers. Some of them received severe injuries. In a word, a chaotic situation had been prevailing in the factory.\nAfter observing the situation, the authority of the factory took steps to pacify the workers. The authority announced through loud speaker that the news was a rumour and no fire had broken out. Actually, a pipe containing colour had burst out in the dying section but it caused no casualties. After hearing this announcement twice, the workers understood their follies and went back to their work."

          "explanation": "The pie chart illustrates the percentage distribution of a family's household expenditure across various categories. According to the chart, the highest portion of the family’s income, 35%, is spent on food, which indicates the family's priority on meeting basic needs. Housing and education come next, each consuming 20% of the total budget, showing that the family values both shelter and education equally. Health accounts for 12% of the expenses, which reflects a moderate concern for medical needs. A smaller portion, 5%, is kept aside as savings, suggesting that while the family tries to save, it is not a major focus. The least amount, only 3%, is allocated for transport, implying either minimal travel or the availability of cost-effective transportation. Overall, the chart highlights the family’s priorities, with most of the income being spent on essential needs like food, housing, and education, while less is spent on transport and savings."

In your last letter you wanted to know about the co-curricular activities in my school.\nYou know that I am lucky to study in such a big and famous school which offers us facilities to learn a lot of things besides studies. We can depend on our teachers not only for study matters but also for matters related to our interests. Some of them run different clubs in school. The clubs are places where one can go and pursue his or her hobby. I'm a member of the debating club. We practise debating within the club and arrange debating competitions among different classes and among other schools as well. Our English teacher who runs this club, not only guides us in writing good speeches but also shows us how to present them. 'Our school arranges essay competitions and book reading competitions. Moreover, my school offers a wide range of extra-curricular activities for the students. The school has a musical group and a lot of dramas are played by the students. Besides, the students enjoy hockey and football as extra-curricular activities. Teachers consult with the students at personal level and encourage them to work more and more. The students of this school learn not only for examinations but also for life. In short, I can tell you studying in this school is a great experience. Along with the regular study, we can develop our extracurricular abilities as well.\nI guess, you are planning to shift to a new school. If you ask for suggestion from me, I'll recommend my school without any hesitation.\n\nWith best wishes\nMonir\n"

She was the youngest of the three siblings and was named Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu. Who could imagine at the time that this little girl would one day become the mother of humanity, loving and serving the poorest of the poor. Yes, we are talking about none other than Mother Teresa.\n\nAt the age of 12, she heard a voice from within that urged her to spread the love of Christ. She decided that she would be a missionary. At the age of 18 , she left her parental home. She then joined an Irish community of nuns called the Sisters of Loreto, which had missions in India.\n\nAfter a few months of training at the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Dublin, Mother Teresa came to India. On May 24, 1931, she took her initial vows as a nun. From 1931 to 1948, Mother Teresa taught geography and theology at St. Mary's High School in Kolkata (then Calcutta). However, the widespread poverty in Kolkata had a deep impact on Mother Teresa and in 1948, she received permission from her superiors to leave the convent and devote herself to caring for the poorest of the poor in the slums of Kolkata.\n\nFor the contribution to humanity, she was awarded the Noble Peace Prize in 1979. She died at the age of 87 , on 5 September, 1997.\nWrite a summary of the above passage in your own words.",
