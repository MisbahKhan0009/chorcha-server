Unlike wall art, which is typically organized and sanctioned, graffiti thrives on immediacy, spontaneity, and the risk of persecution. Where wall art may take time and care, graffiti is often quick, requiring speed and anonymity due to the threat of detection. Its purpose is to challenge power, counter surveillance, and inscribe messages that are otherwise censored or suppressed. The July uprising brought new dimensions to this medium of dissent. Spray-painted slogans defied erasure, embodying collective rage and revolutionary şolidarity. Demands like \"Ek dofa, ek dabi, shoirachar tui kobe jabi?\" surfaced as cries for justice, echoing the French philosopher Jacques Derrida's assertion that \"What cannot be said... must not be silenced but written.\"\nA strong sense of inclusivity was also reflected in the wall art and graffiti during and after the July uprising, which highlighted the case of the marginalized and minoritized people in multiple instances. Numerous graffiti and wall art pieces not only called for justice but also carried a broader message of liberation,.\"Not a land of one nation, Bangladesh is a land of many communities\" symbolizing the interconnected struggles of all communities. It underscored the message i.e. our collective liberation is intertwined with the fight for justice uniting people across regions and backgrounds.\nThe true power of graffiti lies in its resilience; it persists as a medium for revolutionary memory and collective consciousness. It speaks for those silenced, ensures the struggles of the marginalized endure, and, as Banksy's words suggest, comforts the disturbed while disturbing the comfortable.\nChoose the correct answer from the alternatives.",

          "explanation": "An Ant and a Dove\nOne day an ant fell into the water of a pond. It was struggling hard to reach the bank of the pond, but in vain. A dove was sitting on the branch of a nearby tree. He became sympathetic noticing the struggle of the ant. He wanted to save him. So, she dropped a leaf in front of the ant. The ant got on the leaf. Then the leaf slowly reached the bank of the river. Thus, the dove saved the ant's life. Being grateful, the ant thanked her a lot. Another day, when the ant was seeking food under that tree, he noticed that a hunter was aiming at the dove. The dove did not notice it. The ant thought, \"I must save the life of the dove as she saved mine the other day\". So, he bit on the leg of the hunter. At this time, the hunter's hands trembled and the arrow missed its aim. Then, the dove flew away and was thus saved."

Why do we learn English, in our schools and colleges?\nSumon: Well, English is the international medium of communication and it's necessary for everybody. We're learning English because most of the books in higher level are written in English.\nSamir: Well, but we're not able to communicate in English although we've been learning it for 10-12 years, What do you think is the reason?\nSumon: Yes, you're right. I think the problem is in our system of teaching. We're still following the traditional & old system of learning. We must adopt new scientific techniques to get a command over this language.\nSamir: How do I have good command over English?\nSumon: You may get yourself admitted into a reputed language learning centre.\nSamir: Thank you, Sumon. Byе.\nSumon: Bye."
