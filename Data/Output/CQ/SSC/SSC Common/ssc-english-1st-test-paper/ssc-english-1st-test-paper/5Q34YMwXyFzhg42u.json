Climate change is increasing the water temperature in rivers, lakes and seas. This means there is less food and oxygen available for fish. It also means the fish may not grow fully and may have fewer offsprings. Some fishes will become extinct if temperatures rise even by one or two degrees celsius.\nClimate change increases the pressure on fish population. Fishes are one of the world's most valuable biological assets. Forty percent of people in the world eat fish as their main source of protein. If we fail to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we will increase the pressure on fish. As a result, people who depend on fish will suffer from hunger and poverty.\n\nQuestion:\nIt is (a) — from the passage that global warming is (b) — great threat for fish population. (c) — global warming, food production and oxygen (d) — in water decrease. As a result, some fishes may be extinct (e) ——.",

He took his graduation from the Central School of Engineering in Paris and went to work for a railway construction company. His mother thought that he would not go far. \"Be patient, mum. I've got some ideas. You'll see,\" Gustave assured his mother. For years, Gustave made plan after plan of dams, factories, stations and structures of great sized buildings. All over Europe, engineers copied them. In the middle of 1880s, a group of French industrialists persuaded the government to organize a World Fair in Paris. Oustave proposed a 989 feet tower of iron as a symbol of the fair. The construction of the tower began in January 1887. Forty engineers and designers worked under Gustave's direction for two years.

It is regarded as one of the wonders of the world.\nWrite a summary of the above passage in your own words.",

          "question": "",
          "explanation": "Tree Plantation\nTree plantation means planting trees on a large scale in a planned way. Trees are our friends. They give us shade and soothe our eyes with their green colour. They give us various kinds of fruits. They give us firewood as fuel for cooking. They give us timber for furniture, doors and windows, boats, electric poles, railway slippers, etc. They give us rubber too. Trees take in carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. Sufficient trees cause sufficient rainfall and prevent draught. Trees along the roadside and coastal areas preyent erosion and tidal bore. But many inconsiderate pcople are cutting down trees for their selfish interests. So, we are losing trees. If there is no tree, there will be no civilization. In fact, the loss of trees will take our existence to the verge of extinction. The earth will be no more habitable. Hence, tree plantation must be taken as a project. The more we plant trees, the morė our environment will be balanced and greener. In Bangladesh, tree plantation is compulsory because we do not have as much forest as we require to maintain the ecological balance. There is no specific time to plant trees. We can plant trees any time of the year based on the type of the trees. Park, yard, urban areas, open field, balcony, rooftops; roadside places, etc. are best places to plant trees. To make life peaceful, there is no alternative to tree plantation."

One day, while she was busy in work, a sound was heard, \"Fire! Fire! Help! Help! As ill news runs apace, the news spread very fast, among the workers. But no one noticed whether there was actually any fire or not. Having just heard the news, without any confirmation, all the workers of the factory became desperate to come outside.\nBut the factory had only one exit and the path which led to this gate was very narrow. Even three men or women could not pass through this path side by side at a time. So, when all the workers of the factory were trying to come out along this narrow path, the path became congested with the workers. Many workers fell down on the path because of the jostling in the crowd and were trampled by other workers. Some of them received severe injuries. In a word, a chaotic situation had been prevailing in the factory.\nAfter observing the situation, the authority of the factory took steps to pacify the workers. The authority announced through loud speaker that the news was a rumour and no fire had broken out. Actually, a pipe containing colour had burst out in the dying section but it caused no casualties. After hearing this announcement twice, the workers understood their follies and went back to their work."

Perhaps, both of us have been busy with our studies. Today, I would like to describe a train journey that I undertook recently.\nA few days ago, I along with my parents made a journey by train from Dhaka to Mymensingh. On the day of journey, we reached Kamalapur Railway Station very early in the morning. The station was very crowded. The Tista Express was waiting for its passengers parked on platform no. 4. We boarded the train and took our seats. I chose a window seat. At 7.30 a.m, the train blew its whistle and we started moving slowly. After a few minutes, it gained speed. Soon, we left the crowded city and entered the country side. We were passing through the green fields. The farmers were ploughing the fields and taking care of the crops. Shepherds were grazing cattle in the fields. Many children were busy playing in the field and making faces at us. Women were washing clothes and taking bath in the ponds. As the train was moving, the trees seemed running backwards. Everything was coming to sight quite fast and then disappearing even faster. The sun was trying to peep through the clouds. Indeed, the scenery was very charming. We passed by many small and big towns. The train finally reached Mymensingh at 10:20 a.m. We got down from the train and saw my uncle and cousins waiting at the station. They were very happy to see us. Truly, it was a pleasant journey by train. I still cherish the memory of the journey in my mind.\nPlease convey my greetings to aunty, uncle and your little brother Pranto.\n\nYour best friend,\nSamia/ Sayeem"
