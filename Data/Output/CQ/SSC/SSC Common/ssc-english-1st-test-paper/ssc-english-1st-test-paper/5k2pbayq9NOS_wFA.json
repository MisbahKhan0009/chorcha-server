          "explanation": "Early Rising\n\nEarly rising is a positive habit. It means that we should get up from bed early in the morning to enable ourselves to be ready for a new day. This fact, when made into a regular habit, will surely lead us to a world of bliss and prosperity. A proverb says, \"Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.\" Early rising has many benefits. The man who rises early in the morning can take some exercises or a walk in the fresh air by the riverside or in the open field. It makes our minds fresh and lively. Early in the morning, nature seems quiet and calm. No hue and cry are heard then. Nature smiles in the morning with colourful flowers and green leaves. Birds begin to chirp. These beautiful gifts and colourful nature in the morning remind everybody of the Creator. One feels like praying to the Almighty: But it is not easy to attain this quality. Sleeping late at night does not help in early rising. So, to rise early from bed, we have to go to bed early. An early riser enjoys the surroundings very much and gets enough time to do his work either in study or in other work, which will bring him success. On the contrary, if one gets up late, the schedule of his work becomes interrupted. Above all, early rising keeps us healthy and cheerful. For all these reasons, we all should cultivate the habit of early rising."

I don't read newspaper.\n\nNadim : What! It's really surprising!\n\nFahim : Why? What's the importance of reading newspaper?\n\nNadim : Well. Newspaper is a collection of current affairs of the world. Without reading it, you're like a frog in a dark well. Do you know what are the burning issues of our country now? Or, what's going on in our neighbouring countries?\n\nFahim : Really not.\n\nNadim : But I know, because I read newspapers regularly. Newspapers can provide you with the news of the home and abroad. It's especially important for the students as it's the best medium of enriching our general knowledge. For this, it's called the storehouse of knowledge.\n\nFahim : You're right.\n\nNadim : Newspaper can make you introduce to the culture and customs of different countries of the world. You can know some such important information which are applicable to your practical life.\n\nFahim : You've opened my eyes. Now, I can feel the necessity of reading newspapers. Really, I'm detached from the current world. But I promise, I'll build up the\nhabit of reading newspaper from today. Thank you very much.\n\nNadim : You're most welcome."

          "explanation": "(a) Humans can neither change the sun's radiation nor the earth's orbit around the sun, because these things are beyond their control.\n\n(b) Human beings do some unwise activities like burning too much fossil fuels, setting up more factories, cutting down trees indiscriminately, etc. that result in the increase of greenhouse gases. Thus, they are responsible for the increase in the greenhouse gases.\n\n(c) I think the main cause of the increase in carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels. With the increase of industrial activities, the combustion of coal has increased. Besides coal, mineral oil and natural gas are also burned for various purposes. Thus, every time a fossil raw material is burned, it releases carbon dioxide into the air.\n\n(d) Enormous areas of forests are destroyed by the people every year to obtain wood and to clear regions for mining and to create pasture."
