He was born on 19 August 1935 in the village Majupur in Feni district. He was an active worker of the Language Movement, He was one of the ten students to go out in a procession on 21 February 1952 despite a ban on such activities imposed by the authorities. As a result, he and many others were arrested and taken to prison. Raihan was also present at the historical meeting of Amtala on 21 February 1952. He also took part in the Mass Movement in 1969. In 1971, he joined the Liberation War.\nAll through his life, Zahir Raihan dreamt of a demoçratic society, a society that would ensure freedom of speech. He had many dreams about our film industry too. He made a legendary film Jibon Thèke Neya based on the Language Movement of 1952. It was a protest against the autocratic government then ruling our country. The family portrayed in that film symbolically represented East Pakistan. The family was ruled by an autocrat who had to go to the prison for her conspiracy. During the Liberation War in 1971, this film was shown outside Bangladesh. Celebrated filmmakers like Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, and Ritwik Ghatak appreciated the film. Raihan gave all the money the. film made to the Freedom, Fighters' trust. Besides, his great documentary on Pakistani atrocities, Stop Genocide, helped create world sentiment in fayour of our Liberation War.\nOn 30 December 1971, someone informed Raihan about an address somewhere at Mirpur, where he might find his brother, the famous writer Shahidullah Kaiser, who had gone missing from 14 December 1971. Kaiser was captured and killed by the Pakistani army and the local collaborators during the last days of the war. Accordingly, Raihan left home to get his brother back but he never returned.\nZahir Raihan's dream was fulfilled. But it's a pity that this dreamer could not live to see his dream come true.\nChoose the correct answer from the following alternatives.",

I slowly walked to the door and opened it. A man was standing outside, holding a small. lantern. He looked tired and lost. He said, “Please let me in. I am caught in the storm.\" I felt sorry for him and invited him inside. He thanked me and sat near the fireplace. I gave him some tea-to warm him up. He told me that he was a traveler and had lost his way in the storm. While we were talking, the wind grew stronger, and the windows rattled. Suddenly, the lantern went out. We were in total darkness again. The man calmly said, \"Don't worry. The storm will pass soon.\" I felt a little safe because he was calm. After a while, the storm stopped and the lights came back. The man smiled and said, \"Thank you for your kindness. I'must go now.\" He left quietly, disappearing into the night. I closed the door and realized that helping someone, even a stranger, in need can bring peace and warmth to both hearts."
