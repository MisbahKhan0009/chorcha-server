          "explanation": "(a) Humans can neither change the sun's radiation nor the earth's orbit around the sun, because these things are beyond their control.\n\n(b) Human beings do some unwise activities like burning too much fossil fuels, setting up more factories, cutting down trees indiscriminately, etc. that result in the increase of greenhouse gases. Thus, they are responsible for the increase in the greenhouse gases.\n\n(c) I think the main cause of the increase in carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels. With the increase of industrial activities, the combustion of coal has increased. Besides coal, mineral oil and natural gas are also burned for various purposes. Thus, every time a fossil raw material is burned, it releases carbon dioxide into the air.\n\n(d) Enormous areas of forests are destroyed by the people every year to obtain wood and to clear regions for mining and to create pasture."

          "explanation": "Tree Plantation\nTrees are an inseparable part of our existence on the earth. Tree plantation means planting trees at a large scale in a planned way. Actually, we should plant trees for many reasons. Trees are the most important and useful of all the elements of our environment. They provide us with various kinds of fruits and firewood. They give us timber for furniture, doors and windows, boats, electric poles, railway slippers, etc. Moreover, they give us shade and protect our houses from cyclone and storms. Most importantly, trees take in carbon dioxide and produce oxygen without which we cannot survive. Sufficient trees cause sufficient rainfall and prevent drought. Trees along the roadside and coastal areas prevent erosion and tidal bore. Even many kinds of medicines are prepared from the leaves, roots and barks of herbal trees. For Bangladesh, tree plantation is a must because we do not have so much forest as we need to maintain ecological balance. If trees are cut down at random, the balance of our environment will be hampered. The temperature of the world will increase and it will bring about different types of natural disasters. To make our life peaceful on earth, there is no alternative to tree plantation. Hence, tree plantation must be taken as a project. The rainy season is the best time for planting trees. During this period, the government should provide saplings to general people at a lower price in order to make the tree plantation project successful. We should always bear in mind that the more we plant trees, the more our environment will be balanced, cleaner, safer and greener."

          "explanation": "Slow but Steady Wins the Race\nOnce, there lived a hare in a forest. He was always proud of speed. A tortoise also lived there. The hare always teased the tortoise for its slow speed. One day, the hare was walking. Suddenly, he saw the tortoise. It was moving very slowly. He laughed at it saying, \"Hurry up, you are so slow! Can't you move a little faster?\" The tortoise felt angry and said, \"Why don't we run a race and see who wins?\" The hare laughed even more loudly and said, \"Why not? Let's do that.\" The next morning, they started their race. The hare ran so fast that the tortoise remained far behind. He looked back, but there was no trace of the tortoise. The hare was sure of his victory, and hence, he sat under a tree to take rest, but unfortunately he fell asleep. On the other hand, the tortoise ran slowly but steadily, and in a short time, it passed by the sleeping hare. When the hare woke up, he looked around and saw in surprise that the tortoise was near the finishing line. He ran as fast as he could, but it was too late. After that, the tortoise had reached the finishing line. The tortoise looked back at the hare and said smilingly, \"See how the slow but steady wins the race!\""

          "explanation": "The bar chart deals with the number of people living below the poverty line in the years of 1995, 2004, 2008 and 2010. In the bar chart, the percentage of the number of people living below the poverty line is compared among four years. 35.6 percent people were living under the poverty line in 1995. Nine years later, in 2004, the number rose to 45 percent which is about 9.4 percent higher than 1995 . In 2008, fortunately the number decreased to 36.3 percent which is about 8.7 percent lower than that of four years ago. Finally, in 2010 , with a happy note the number decreased to 31.51 percent which is about 4.79 percent lower than that of 2008. So, it can be said that within the time span of 15 years the percentage of the people living below the poverty line has slightly been decreased. Though in 2008 the number rose, in the following years it decreased gradually."

          "explanation": "a. February 21 is a memorable day in our national history because on this day in 1952, the heroic son's of Bengal laid down their lives to establish Bangla as a state language of the undivided Pakistan. On this day, we pay tribute to the language martyrs because of their sacrifice for the rightful place of mother tongue.\nb. The then Governor General of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Zinnah, is responsible to raise a storm of protest. In a public meeting in Dhaka, he declared Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan, which disregarded the language rights of the Bangalee. Therefore, a mass protest started across the country.\nc. The Pakistani government banned all sorts of public meetings and gatherings to stop the protest that began following Mohammad Ali Jinnah's declaration of Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan and continued non-stop.\nd. Against the declaration of outlawing all sorts of public meeting and rallies, the students of Dhaka University brought out a peaceful protest procession on 21 February, defying the law.\ne. The Language Movement of 1952 kindled the sparks of independence movement in East Pakistan by making the Bangalees aware of their rights. Thus, the Language Movement is related to the independence movement of Bangladesh."
