Although Dr. Vasan notes that anyone can feel lonely at any time in their life, a few groups that stand out as having an increased risk of loneliness include young adults, mothers with young children and the elderly. Immigrants are also at higher risk for loneliness, continues Dr. Vasan.\nYou may experience loneliness for a variety of reasons, but it can often stem from a major life change. A 2020 study by the University of Edinburgh suggests that the causes of loneliness differ depending on the age of the individual. For example, older adults experience loneliness morè frequently as a result of living alone than as a cause of their loneliness.\nThis discrepancy between what causes loneliness in older adults versus those who are middle-aged could be due to the fact that older adults have retired and no longer have the community and daily interactions of work life, explains Nikki Press, Psy.D., a clinical psychologist in New York City. Older individuals are more likely to experience medical or physical limitations that restrict their opportunities for activities and socializing, continues Dr. Press.\nOther common causes of loneliness include:\nThe death of a close friend or family member\nPhysical isolation, such as living alone or moving away from family and friends\nIllness or disability\nRetirement\nWorking alone\nChoose the correct answer from the alternatives.",

The sight of the piece of meat made his mouth full of water. He thought for sometimes. He hit upon a plan to have it. He 'said to the crow, \"Oh beautiful Crow! Your complexion is so fair. I think, you can sing nicely. Would you please sing a song for me?\" At first, the crow did not want to sing. But as the fox carried on praising her, she felt proud of her tongue. Finally, she started to sing a song. But no sooner had she opened her mouth than the piece of meat fell off from her mouth. Then the clever fox took it and ran away. The crow had paid a heavy price for his foolishness."

The newspaper says climate change is getting worse, and it's really going to change how we live.\nTapan: Yeah, things are changing and being affected badly. What did you read that worried you the most?\n\nShapan: It talks about super, hot summers (heatwaves) and giant floods or long, dry spells of droughts. These big storms and floods can ruin homes and farms.\nTapan: That means trouble for food and water, right? Ifthe weather is all mixed up, farmers can't grow rice or wheat properly.\n\nShapan: And if the rain doesn't fall when it should, we won't have enough drinking water.\nTapan: Unfortunately, it makes life very hard for people who are already poor.\n\nShapan: Exactly! When it gets really hot, people get sick more easily.\nTapan : Warmer weather means more mosquitoes, which can spread diseases like dengue to new places.\n\nShapan: You're right. Besides, people can't live in their hometowns when there is flood or cyclone in their areas. It causes many other problems.\nTapan: It's all connected. It's not just about saving polar bears; it's about making sure that humans can live safe and healthy lives.\n\nShapan: We all need to form some good habits to keep the environment clean and safe.\nTapan: I agree. We have to act wisely."
