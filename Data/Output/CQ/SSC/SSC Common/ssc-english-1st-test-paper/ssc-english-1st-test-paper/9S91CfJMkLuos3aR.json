          "explanation": "Environment Pollution\nThe surroundings in which a person, animal or plant lives is called environment. There are many elements in our environment. Air, water, soil, plants, animals, etc. are such elements. They are essential for the environment as well as human beings. These elements should be sound for our sound living. But when they are polluted and their essential balance is disrupted, this phenomenon is known as environmental pollution. Nowadays, almost everywhere, the environment is being seriously polluted. In many places of our country, the environment has become extremely polluted. Actually, we ourselves are responsible for this severe pollution. Industries and factories emit huge amount of smoke, gases and fume. Motor vehicles also emit large amount of smoke and gases. All these pollute air seriously and polluted air is very harmful for us. Moreover, water is polluted due to dumping of industrial wastes and by chemical fertilizers and insecticides which are washed away into rivers and canals. Due to indiscriminate use of vehicle horns, loud speakers, mikes, etc. sound is polluted. Soil is polluted by harmful chemical fertilizers and insecticides. Besides, people are cutting down trees at random. All these are causing environmental pollution. Consequently, man becomes sick, animals and fishes are getting reduced, global warming is increasing, polar icecaps are melting, frequent floods are occurring and so on. So, we all should be aware of this harmful pollution and take effective measures to solve it."

Many predictions have been made with respect to Maldives being swept away by the rising water level in the Indian Ocean. It was even seen during the tsunami of 2004, that many of the island's dry parts were flooded by waters shrinking the island. The government of the Maldives has begun to purchase land from nearby countries in case the islands go under water! In order to highlight the threats of global warming to its low lying islands, the government of Maldives held a cabinet meeting underwater in 2009. That was the first ever cabinet meeting in the world that took place underwater. The meeting took place about 5 metres underwater, in a blue-green lagoon on a small island. While underwater, the cabinet signed a document calling on all nations to cut their carbon emissions.",
