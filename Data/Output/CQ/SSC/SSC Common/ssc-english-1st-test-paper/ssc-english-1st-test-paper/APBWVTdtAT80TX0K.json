          "question": "",
          "explanation": "(a) Humans can neither change the sun's radiation nor the earth's orbit around the sun, because these things are beyond their control.\n\n(b) Human beings do some unwise activities like burning too much fossil fuels, setting up more factories, cutting down trees indiscriminately, etc. that result in the increase of greenhouse gases. Thus, they are responsible for the increase in the greenhouse gases.\n\n(c) I think the main cause of the increase in carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels. With the increase of industrial activities, the combustion of coal has increased. Besides coal, mineral oil and natural gas are also burned for various purposes. Thus, every time a fossil raw material is burned, it releases carbon dioxide into the air.\n\n(d) Enormous areas of forests are destroyed by the people every year to obtain wood and to clear regions for mining and to create pasture."

          "explanation": "Global warming refers to the gradual increase in Earth's average temperature caused primarily by the buildup of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide in the atmosphere. The main causes of global warming include the excessive burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, industrial emissions, and agriculture, which release large amounts of these harmful gases. The effects of global warming are devastating and include rising sea levels, extreme weather events, loss of biodiversity, melting glaciers, and disruption of ecosystems. To prevent global warming, we can adopt renewable energy sources, plant more trees, reduce fossil fuel use, and promote eco-friendly practices. If we fail to prevent global warming, the near future may witness catastrophic consequences such as severe climate changes, increased natural disasters, massive displacement of people due to rising seas, and irreversible damage to life on Earth."

He took the bundle of money and went to his class teacher.\"Ayat, what brings you here?\" asked his teacher.\"Ma'am, I found this bundle of money on my way to school. I thought I should give it to you. Maybe someone lost it,\" replied Ayat.\n\nHis teacher was impressed by Ayat's honesty and kindness. She checked the bundle of money, found a small note with a name and phone number. She called the number and informed the person that Ayat had found the money. It turned out that the money belonged to an old woman who had saved it up for her grandson's treatment. She had lost it while going back from the bank.\n\nThe old woman was grateful when she got her money back. Then she thanked Ayat and his teacher for their honesty and kindness. She even invited Ayat to her house and gave him some home-cooked sweets as a token of gratitude. Ayat felt happy to see the smile on the old woman's face. He realized that helping others could bring joy and happiness to one's life. He decided to start a small charity program in his school to help the poor and needy."

          "explanation": "The pie chart shows the subject preferences of students in a secondary school. It highlights their interest in four key subjects: Mathematics, Science, Bangla, and English. According to the chart, Mathematics is the most preferred subject, with 35% of the students showing interest in it. This is followed by Science, which attracts 25% of the students. Bangla is also popular, drawing the attention of 23% of the students. English, however, is the least chosen subject, with only 17% showing interest in it.\nFrom the data, it is clear that students tend to favor subjects related to logic and reasoning, such as Mathematics and Science, over languages. This could be due to the growing importance of science and technology in modern education and career paths. Nonetheless, the significant interest in Bangla reflects a continued appreciation for the mother tongue. Overall, the chart shows a balanced but slightly science-leaning academic interest among students."

Newspaper is a collection of current affairs of the world. Without reading it, you're like a frog in a dark well. Do you know what are the burning issues of our country now? Or, what's going on in our neighbouring countries?\n\nFahim : Really not.\n\nNadim : But I know, because I read newspapers regularly. Newspapers can provide you with the news of the home and abroad. It's especially important for the students as it's the best medium of enriching our general knowledge. For this, it's called the storehouse of knowledge.\n\nFahim : You're right.\n\nNadim : Newspaper can make you introduce to the culture and customs of different countries of the world. You can know some such important information which are applicable to your practical life.\n\nFahim : You've opened my eyes. Now, I can feel the necessity of reading newspapers. Really, I'm detached from the current world. But I promise, I'll build up the\nhabit of reading newspaper from today. Thank you very much.\n\nNadim : You're most welcome."

          "explanation": "Noha: Hey Mahin! I was reading an article yesterday about how mobile phones affect teenagers. It got me thinking—do you think it's more helpful or harmful?\nMahin: Hey Noha! That’s actually a great topic. I think it’s a bit of both. Mobile phones are super helpful for staying connected and accessing information, but they also have their downsides.\nNoha: Totally agree. Like, one of the biggest merits is easy communication. We can call, text, or video chat with friends and family anytime.\nMahin: Yeah, and educational apps and online resources make studying easier too. We can watch tutorials, join online classes, and even do research quickly.\nNoha: Right. But on the flip side, many teens get addicted to social media and games. That really affects their studies and sleep.\nMahin: Exactly. And some even suffer from anxiety or low self-esteem because of comparing themselves to others on social media.\nNoha: Another issue is less face-to-face interaction. I feel like teens are losing social skills because they’re always on their phones.\nMahin: True. Plus, spending too much time staring at screens can cause eye problems and other health issues.\nNoha: But still, if we use mobile phones responsibly, they can be very useful. It’s all about balance, right?\nMahin: Definitely. Using phones wisely can make teenage life easier and more productive, but overuse can lead to serious problems.\nNoha: Well said, Mahin. I think every teen should know both sides before using a phone too much.\nMahin: For sure. Awareness is the first step to using technology in a healthy way"

      "uddipok": "Mother Teresa was moved by the sight of the sick and dying on the streets of Kolkata. She founded a home for the dying destitute and named it \"Nirmal Hriday\", meaning \"Pure Heart\". She and her fellow nuns gathered the dying people of the streets of Kolkata and brought them to this home. They were lovingly looked after and cared for. Since then men, women and children have been taken from the streets and carried to Nirmal Hriday. These unloved and uncared for people get an opportunity to die in an environment of kindness and love. In their last hours they get human and divine love, and can feel they are also children of God. Those who survive, the Missionaries of Charity try to find jobs for them or send them to homes where they can live happily for some more years in a caring environment. Regarding commitment to family, Mother Teresa said, \"May be in our own family, we have somebody, who is feeling lonely, who is feeling sick, who is feeling worried, are we there? Are we willing to give until it hurts in order to be with our families, or do we put our interest first? We must remember that love begins at home and we must also remember that future of humanity passes through the family.\" Mother Teresa's work has been recognised thought the world and she has received a number of awards. These include the Pope John XXIII Peace Prize (1971), the Nehru Prize for Promotion of International Peace and Understanding (1972), the Balzan Prize (1978), the Nobel Peace Prize (1979) and the Bharat Ratna, (1980). Mother Teresa died at the age of 87, on 5 September 1997. The world salutes her for her love and compassion for humanity. She has taught us how to extend our hand towards those who need our love and support irrespective of creed, caste and religion.
