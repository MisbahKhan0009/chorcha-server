Only during the last hundred years the carbon dioxide concentration has been raised alarmingly in the atmosphere and we humans can be held responsible for this. The main cause of the increase in carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels. Since the end of the 19th century, industrial activities increased rapidly giving rise to many factories. These factories required energy, which was produced through the combustion of coal. Besides coal, other sources of energy such as mineral òil and natural gas were also burned to heat our houses, run cars and airplanes or to produce electricity. Nowadays, about 85 million barrels of crude oil are burned daily. Every time a fossil raw material is burned, it roleases carbon dioxide into the air. Therefore, it is clear that more and more greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide are being generated worldwide by humans. Moreover, we are also strengthening the greenhouse effect by deforestation, which means cutting down trees. Every year enormous areas of forests are destroyed by people to obtain wood and to clear regions for mining and to create pasture. This loss of the forest causes dual problems. Trees that are burned up release large volumes of carbon dioxide gas into the air. On the other hand, as forest absorb a lot of carbon dioxide from the air and deliver oxygen instead, we also destroy an important storehouse of carbon dioxide when we clear forests.\nChoose the correct answer from the following alternatives:",

But one day, while cutting wood, his axe slipped from his hand and fell into a deep river nearby. The woodcutter became very sad because it was the only axe he had, and he could not afford a new one.\nHe sat on the riverbank and started crying. Suddenly, a kind fairy appeared from the water and asked him why he was crying. The woodcutter told her everything. The fairy dived into the river and came up with a golden axe . “Is this yours?” she asked. The woodcutter said, “No, this is not mine.”\nThen she brought a silver axe and asked the same question. Again, the woodcutter replied, “No, that’s not mine either.” Finally, she brought his old iron axe , and he happily said, “Yes! That one is mine!”\nThe fairy was very pleased with his honesty and gave him all three axes as a reward. The woodcutter went home joyfully and lived happily ever after. His honesty brought him unexpected blessings."
