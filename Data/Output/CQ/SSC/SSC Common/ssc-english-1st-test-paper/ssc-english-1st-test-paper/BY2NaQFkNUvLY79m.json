Climate change is increasing the water temperature in rivers, lakes and seas. This means there is less food and oxygen available for fish. It also means the fish may not grow fully and may have fewer offsprings. Some fishes will become extinct if temperatures rise even by one or two degrees celsius.\nClimate change increases the pressure on fish population. Fishes are one of the world's most valuable biological assets. Forty percent of people in the world eat fish as their main source of protein. If we fail to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we will increase the pressure on fish. As a result, people who depend on fish will suffer from hunger and poverty.\n\nQuestion:\nIt is (a) — from the passage that global warming is (b) — great threat for fish population.

At the age of 7, in 1615 he got himself admitted in Star Palace School. But Milton could not pay attention to his studies in this school. After a couple of years, he left the school and studied at St. Paul's School till 1624. In the succeeding year, John Milton entered Christ College in Cambridge. He took his M.A degree at the age of 24 and went to his father's house in the village of Horton. Milton's father, however, had faith in his son and allowed him to continue his studies at Horton from 1632 to 1638 . During his time, he made himself master of everything worth knowing in the literature of Rome, Greece, Italy, France, Spain and the Bible. In 1643, Milton met Mary Powel in a occasion and married her. But this great poet became blind in 1652. The idea behind his famous work 'Paradise Lost' developed after his blindness.

          "explanation": "The bar chart deals with the number of people living below the poverty line in the years of 1995, 2004, 2008 and 2010. In the bar chart, the percentage of the number of people living below the poverty line is compared among four years. 35.6 percent people were living under the poverty line in 1995. Nine years later, in 2004, the number rose to 45 percent which is about 9.4 percent higher than 1995 . In 2008, fortunately the number decreased to 36.3 percent which is about 8.7 percent lower than that of four years ago. Finally, in 2010 , with a happy note the number decreased to 31.51 percent which is about 4.79 percent lower than that of 2008. So, it can be said that within the time span of 15 years the percentage of the people living below the poverty line has slightly been decreased. Though in 2008 the number rose, in the following years it decreased gradually."

It makes me happy that you want to know about my country.\nLet's start with the geographical position of this small country. It is a South-Asian country surrounded by India on three sides and the Bay of Bengal on the south. Myanmar lies to her south-east. Its area is 1,48,460 square kilometres where about 160 million people live. So you see the density of population in our country is high. The country achieved independence in 1971 after fighting against the well-equipped Pakistani Army for nine months. We are the only nation who has the glory of fighting for its mother language. Our Language Movement took place in 1952. Bangladesh is marked as a country of beauty. There are many places of tourist attraction in Bangladesh. We have a long cultural tradition, literature, arts, etc. that are very developed and have acquired international recognition.\nThe people in Bangladesh are very hard-working, ready to face any obstacles. They are very hospitable. They become very happy when they have a guest at home and try their best to entertain the guest. They like to talk a lot, even to the strangers or foreigners. People here are much curious about foreigners.\nAnyway, the letter is getting long. No more today. I would like to invite you to visit my country as soon as possible. Take care.\n\nWith love,\nAnuvob"

          "explanation": "a. February 21 is a memorable day in our national history because on this day in 1952, the heroic son's of Bengal laid down their lives to establish Bangla as a state language of the undivided Pakistan. On this day, we pay tribute to the language martyrs because of their sacrifice for the rightful place of mother tongue.\nb. The then Governor General of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Zinnah, is responsible to raise a storm of protest. In a public meeting in Dhaka, he declared Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan, which disregarded the language rights of the Bangalee. Therefore, a mass protest started across the country.\nc. The Pakistani government banned all sorts of public meetings and gatherings to stop the protest that began following Mohammad Ali Jinnah's declaration of Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan and continued non-stop.\nd. Against the declaration of outlawing all sorts of public meeting and rallies, the students of Dhaka University brought out a peaceful protest procession on 21 February, defying the law.\ne. The Language Movement of 1952 kindled the sparks of independence movement in East Pakistan by making the Bangalees aware of their rights. Thus, the Language Movement is related to the independence movement of Bangladesh."
