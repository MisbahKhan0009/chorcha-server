          "explanation": "Traffic Jam\n\nTraffic jam is a situation in which a long line of vehicles on a road have stopped moving or are moving very slowly. Nowadays, traffic jam is a common problem in our towns and cities. It causes great sufferings to the passengers and the passers-by. The increasing number of vehicles mostly causes traffic jam. Day by day, the number of vehicles is increasing to meet the needs of the increased population. But the roads are not increasing in that proportion. Many vehicles moving on the same road at a timé' cause traffic jąm. Many drivers do not abide by traffic rules. Besides, the traffic police are not sincere. The tendency of the bus drivers and conductors to get more passengers also causes traffic jam. Some drivers stop buses here and there and board and unboard passengers. This hampers the movement of other vehicles and causes traffic jam. The unlimited number of rickshaws plying on the streets is another cause of traffic jam. The general people have to face untold sufferings. They reach late at their working places. Students, employees, businessmen, workers all suffer tremendously for this. It occurs mostly during office and school or college time. During fraffic jam, we feel extremely bored as it kills our valuable time. To relieve the passengers of the sufferings of traffic jam, some steps should be taken by the government. The drivers who do not abide by traffic rules should be punished. Traffic authority should be active to enforce the traffic rules and maintain the discipline on the roads."

He took the bundle of money and went to his class teacher.\"Ayat, what brings you here?\" asked his teacher.\"Ma'am, I found this bundle of money on my way to school. I thought I should give it to you. Maybe someone lost it,\" replied Ayat.\n\nHis teacher was impressed by Ayat's honesty and kindness. She checked the bundle of money, found a small note with a name and phone number. She called the number and informed the person that Ayat had found the money. It turned out that the money belonged to an old woman who had saved it up for her grandson's treatment. She had lost it while going back from the bank.\n\nThe old woman was grateful when she got her money back. Then she thanked Ayat and his teacher for their honesty and kindness. She even invited Ayat to her house and gave him some home-cooked sweets as a token of gratitude. Ayat felt happy to see the smile on the old woman's face. He realized that helping others could bring joy and happiness to one's life. He decided to start a small charity program in his school to help the poor and needy."

          "explanation": "The graph illustrates the number of total male and female candidates in the SSC Examination 2024 across three groups: Science, Humanities, and Business Studies. Overall, the Humanities group had the highest number of candidates, while Science had the least.\nIn the Science group, 45,000 males and 35,000 females participated. The Humanities group showed the highest participation, with 60,000 male and 70,000 female candidates, indicating a higher female presence. Business Studies had 47,500 male and 45,000 female candidates, showing a fairly balanced distribution.\nIt is evident that more students enrolled in the Humanities group compared to Science and Business Studies. Interestingly, female candidates outnumbered males in the Humanities group, while males had slightly higher numbers in both the Science and Business Studies groups.\nIn conclusion, the graph shows a clear trend of student preference toward Humanities, especially among female candidates, while Science remains the least chosen group by both genders"

Newspaper is a collection of current affairs of the world. Without reading it, you're like a frog in a dark well. Do you know what are the burning issues of our country now? Or, what's going on in our neighbouring countries?\n\nFahim : Really not.\n\nNadim : But I know, because I read newspapers regularly. Newspapers can provide you with the news of the home and abroad. It's especially important for the students as it's the best medium of enriching our general knowledge. For this, it's called the storehouse of knowledge.\n\nFahim : You're right.\n\nNadim : Newspaper can make you introduce to the culture and customs of different countries of the world. You can know some such important information which are applicable to your practical life.\n\nFahim : You've opened my eyes. Now, I can feel the necessity of reading newspapers. Really, I'm detached from the current world. But I promise, I'll build up the\nhabit of reading newspaper from today. Thank you very much.\n\nNadim : You're most welcome."

          "explanation": "Noha: Hey Mahin! I was reading an article yesterday about how mobile phones affect teenagers. It got me thinking—do you think it's more helpful or harmful?\nMahin: Hey Noha! That’s actually a great topic. I think it’s a bit of both. Mobile phones are super helpful for staying connected and accessing information, but they also have their downsides.\nNoha: Totally agree. Like, one of the biggest merits is easy communication. We can call, text, or video chat with friends and family anytime.\nMahin: Yeah, and educational apps and online resources make studying easier too. We can watch tutorials, join online classes, and even do research quickly.\nNoha: Right. But on the flip side, many teens get addicted to social media and games. That really affects their studies and sleep.\nMahin: Exactly. And some even suffer from anxiety or low self-esteem because of comparing themselves to others on social media.\nNoha: Another issue is less face-to-face interaction. I feel like teens are losing social skills because they’re always on their phones.\nMahin: True. Plus, spending too much time staring at screens can cause eye problems and other health issues.\nNoha: But still, if we use mobile phones responsibly, they can be very useful. It’s all about balance, right?\nMahin: Definitely. Using phones wisely can make teenage life easier and more productive, but overuse can lead to serious problems.\nNoha: Well said, Mahin. I think every teen should know both sides before using a phone too much.\nMahin: For sure. Awareness is the first step to using technology in a healthy way"

Our unique source of life and inspiration is our cultural and natural heritage. When we speak of 'World Heritage', it indicates places and sites that we inherited from the past and pass on to the future generation of the entire world.\nThe 'Shat Gambuj Mosque' in Bagerhat is such a heritage. It became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985. Originally, the historic Mosque City was known as 'Khalifatabad'. It is situated at the outskirts of Bagerhat town--- not very far from the dense mangrove forest of the Sundarbans. Khalifatabad was a Muslim colony. It was founded 2 by the Turkish general, a saint warrior Ulugh Khan Jahan in the 15t century. The infrastructure of the city reveals significant technical skills in many mosques as well as early Islamic monuments. Baked bricks were used for the construction of the buildings. The planning of the city was dominated by the tradition of Islamic architecture and the decorations were a combination of Mughal and Turkish architecture.\nKhan Jahan built a network of roads, bridges, public, buildings and reservoirs to make the city habitable. There were about 360 mosques in the city. Among them the most remarkable is the multi-domed Shat Gombuj Mosque. The mosque is unique in the sense that it has 60 pillars that support the roof, with 77 low height domes. The 4 towers at 4 English 1st Paper corners have smaller domes at the top as well. The vast prayer hall has 11 arched doorways on the east and 7 each on the north and south for light and ventilation. It has 7 aisles running along the length of the mosque and 11 deep curves between the slender stone columns. These columns support the curving arches created by the domes. The thickness of the arches is 6 feet and have slightly narrowing hollow and round wall.\nThe west wall in the interior has 11 'mihrabs' (niche in mosque pointing towards Makkah). These mihrabs are decorated with stonework and terracotta. The floor of the mosque is. made of brick.\nBesides being used as a prayer hall, Khan Jahan used the mosque as his court too. Today, it is one of the greatest tourist attractions and one of the best architectural beauties of Bangladesh.\nChoose the correct answer from the following alternatives:",

Climate change is increasing the water temperature in rivers, lakes and seas. This means there is less food and oxygen available for fish. It also means the fish may not grow fully and may have fewer offsprings. Some fishes will become extinct if temperatures rise even by one or two degrees celsius.\nClimate change increases the pressure on fish population. Fishes are one of the world's most valuable biological assets. Forty percent of people in the world eat fish as their main source of protein. If we fail to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we will increase the pressure on fish. As a result, people who depend on fish will suffer from hunger and poverty.\n\nQuestion:\nIt is (a) — from the passage that global warming is (b) — great threat for fish population.
