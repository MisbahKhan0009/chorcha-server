          "explanation": "a. February 21 is a memorable day in our national history because on this day in 1952, the heroic son's of Bengal laid down their lives to establish Bangla as a state language of the undivided Pakistan. On this day, we pay tribute to the language martyrs because of their sacrifice for the rightful place of mother tongue.\nb. The then Governor General of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Zinnah, is responsible to raise a storm of protest. In a public meeting in Dhaka, he declared Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan, which disregarded the language rights of the Bangalee. Therefore, a mass protest started across the country.\nc. The Pakistani government banned all sorts of public meetings and gatherings to stop the protest that began following Mohammad Ali Jinnah's declaration of Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan and continued non-stop.\nd. Against the declaration of outlawing all sorts of public meeting and rallies, the students of Dhaka University brought out a peaceful protest procession on 21 February, defying the law.\ne. The Language Movement of 1952 kindled the sparks of independence movement in East Pakistan by making the Bangalees aware of their rights. Thus, the Language Movement is related to the independence movement of Bangladesh."

          "question": "",
          "explanation": "Tree Plantation\nTree plantation means planting trees on a large scale in a planned way. Trees are our friends. They give us shade and soothe our eyes with their green colour. They give us various kinds of fruits. They give us firewood as fuel for cooking. They give us timber for furniture, doors and windows, boats, electric poles, railway slippers, etc. They give us rubber too. Trees take in carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. Sufficient trees cause sufficient rainfall and prevent draught. Trees along the roadside and coastal areas preyent erosion and tidal bore. But many inconsiderate pcople are cutting down trees for their selfish interests. So, we are losing trees. If there is no tree, there will be no civilization. In fact, the loss of trees will take our existence to the verge of extinction. The earth will be no more habitable. Hence, tree plantation must be taken as a project. The more we plant trees, the morė our environment will be balanced and greener. In Bangladesh, tree plantation is compulsory because we do not have as much forest as we require to maintain the ecological balance. There is no specific time to plant trees. We can plant trees any time of the year based on the type of the trees. Park, yard, urban areas, open field, balcony, rooftops; roadside places, etc. are best places to plant trees. To make life peaceful, there is no alternative to tree plantation."

          "explanation": "Bread Dividing by a Cunning Monkey\nOnce, two rats found a piece of bread. They couldn't agree on how to divide it, because each of them wanted the larger share. They quarrelled for some times. Suddenly, they saw a monkey passing, by. They asked the monkey to divide the bread between them. The monkey was very clever. He såid, \"It is really a difficult task.\" He brought a pair of scales. He divided the bread into two pieces and put them on the scales. One piece was heavier than the other. He took a small bite from the heavier piece and put them again on the scales. This time the other piece was heavier. So, he took a small bite from that piece, but still the pieces were unequal. So, he did the same\nthing again and again. Soon there was only a very small piece of bread left. \"Stop! Stop!\" shouted the rats. \"You are eating all our bread! Give back the piece of bread. We will divide it ourselves.\" The monkey said angrily, \"I have done a lot of work for you. So, I must take this little piece as my wage.\" Saying this, he ate up the piece of bread and went away."

The number of story and poetry books was 1000 and 500 respectively. Thus, it is clear that people love novel most, and so, the selling of this sort of book topped the list.

Thus, the graph shows people's varied interest in various subjects."
