          "explanation": "a. February 21 is a memorable day in our national history because on this day in 1952, the heroic son's of Bengal laid down their lives to establish Bangla as a state language of the undivided Pakistan. On this day, we pay tribute to the language martyrs because of their sacrifice for the rightful place of mother tongue.\nb. The then Governor General of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Zinnah, is responsible to raise a storm of protest. In a public meeting in Dhaka, he declared Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan, which disregarded the language rights of the Bangalee. Therefore, a mass protest started across the country.\nc. The Pakistani government banned all sorts of public meetings and gatherings to stop the protest that began following Mohammad Ali Jinnah's declaration of Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan and continued non-stop.\nd. Against the declaration of outlawing all sorts of public meeting and rallies, the students of Dhaka University brought out a peaceful protest procession on 21 February, defying the law.\ne. The Language Movement of 1952 kindled the sparks of independence movement in East Pakistan by making the Bangalees aware of their rights. Thus, the Language Movement is related to the independence movement of Bangladesh."

      "uddipok": "Mother Teresa was moved by the sight of the sick and dying on the streets of Kolkata. She founded a home for the dying destitute and named it \"Nirmal Hriday\", meaning \"Pure Heart\". She and her fellow nuns gathered the dying people of the streets of Kolkata and brought them to this home. They were lovingly looked after and cared for. Since then men, women and children have been taken from the streets and carried to Nirmal Hriday. These unloved and uncared for people get an opportunity to die in an environment of kindness and love. In their last hours they get human and divine love, and can feel they are also children of God. Those who survive, the Missionaries of Charity try to find jobs for them or send them to homes where they can live happily for some more years in a caring environment. Regarding commitment to family, Mother Teresa said, \"May be in our own family, we have somebody, who is feeling lonely, who is feeling sick, who is feeling worried, are we there? Are we willing to give until it hurts in order to be with our families, or do we put our interest first? We must remember that love begins at home and we must also remember that future of humanity passes through the family.\" Mother Teresa's work has been recognised thought the world and she has received a number of awards. These include the Pope John XXIII Peace Prize (1971), the Nehru Prize for Promotion of International Peace and Understanding (1972), the Balzan Prize (1978), the Nobel Peace Prize (1979) and the Bharat Ratna, (1980). Mother Teresa died at the age of 87, on 5 September 1997. The world salutes her for her love and compassion for humanity. She has taught us how to extend our hand towards those who need our love and support irrespective of creed, caste and religion. The picture of Mother Teresa, draped in a white and blue-bordered sari, with a wrinkled face, ever soft eyes and a saintly smile, lives on in our mind:\n\nQuestion:\nMother Teresa is still alive in our (a)___ though she expired almost 16 years back.

Nowadays, it has become very popular in our country. Last month, I visited'a book fair. I went there with my elder brother. The fair was arranged on the occasion of 21 st 21^{\\text {st }} 2 1 st February, the International Mother Language Day. It was held at the Bangla Academy premises. As it was my first visit to a book fair, I was really surprised when I entered the fair. There were hundreds of stalls at the fair. The environment was charming. The stalls were arranged systematically. There were information counters. There were also some stalls for taking snacks. I saw that all kinds of books such as fiction, drama, poetry, novel, biography, translation, children's literature, story books, etc. were available at the fair. I bought some books on science fiction and comics. After walking for a long time, we became tired. So, we entered a food stall and took some light food. Suddenly, I noticed a crowd in front of a stall. I went there and became surprised to see my favourite writer Abdul Hye Sikder. He was giving autographs. I also took an autograph. We also attended a short seminar at the fair in which some renowned personalities of our country delivered speeches on the importance of books in our life. After that, we left the fair, but I brought with me a lot of pleasant experiences."

At last, he saw a jar. He peeped into the jar and saw that there was a little water at the bottom of the jar. He tried to drink water but his bill could not reach it. He tried again and again but in vain. He became very sad and hopeless. Suddenly, he saw some small pieces of stone near the jar. A good idea came into his head. He picked up the stones and dropped them into the jar one by one. As a result, the water came up to the brim. The crow then drank water from it to his heart's content and flew away with a joyful mind."
