      "uddipok": "Read the passage and answer the questions:\nIn recent times, graffiti has resurfaced as a powerful expression of dissent, particularly during the July uprising. Spray-painted messages like \"The country is nobody's father's\" invoked the legacy of past movements, echoing the ironic \"Gonotontro Mukti Paak\" (Let Democracy Be Free), famously written on the body of protester Noor Hossain during the Ershad regime. Each stroke of paint carried forward a history of defiance that has shaped Bangladesh's political landscape, drawing connections between past and present struggles for justice. Graffiti's potency lies in its subversive, guerrilla nature. Unlike wall art, which is typically organized and sanctioned, graffiti thrives on immediacy, spontaneity, and the risk of persecution. Where wall art may take time and care, graffiti is often quick, requiring speed and anonymity due to the threat of detection. Its purpose is to challenge power, counter surveillance, and inscribe messages that are otherwise censored or suppressed. The July uprising brought new dimensions to this medium of dissent. Spray-painted slógans defied erasure, embodying collective rage and revolutionary solidarity. Demands like \"Ek dofa, ek dabi, shoirachar tui kobe jabi?\" surfaced as cries for justice, echoing the French philosopher Jacques Derrida's ąssertion that “What cannot be said... must not be silenced but written.\" A strong sense of inclusivity was also reflected in the wall art and graffiti during and after the July uprising, which highlighted the case of the marginalized and minoritized people in multiple instances. Numerous graffiti and wall art pieces not only called for justice but also carried a broader message of liberation, \"Not a land of one nation, Bangladesh is a land of many communities,\" symbolizing the interconnected struggles of all communities. It underscored the message i.e., our collective liberation is intertwined, with the fight for justice uniting people across regions and backgrounds. The true power of graffiti lies in its resilience; it persists as a medium for revolutionary memory and collective consciousness. It speaks for those silenced, ensures the struggles of the marginalized endure, and, as Banksy's words. suggest, comforts the disturbed while disturbing the comfortable.\nChoose the correct answer from the alternatives.",

          "explanation": "Finding Stories in History\nIn her last summer vacation, Munira went to Dhaka with her father. There she visited many interesting places. One afternoon she went to visit the National Museum. When they walked inside, the noise of the city stopped. It felt very quiet and peaceful. Munira saw big halls with old kings' weapons and beautiful paintings. But she liked a quiet corner the most. This corner had very old things that ordinary people used to have. She stopped in front of a small, wooden doll. It was simple, not fancy, and looked very, very old. \"Baba, look,\" Munira whispered to her father. \"This doll is quiet, but I feel like it has a long story to tell.\" Her father nodded and smiled. \"Sometimes, the smallest and simplest things have the most interesting stories,\" he said.\nMunira understood that the museums'weren't just about big buildings; they were about finding the stories of people's lives long ago. She felt happy because she found a special treasure that was not shiny or loud, but full of history."

What are you doing?\nShanta: I'm preparing an assignment on the importance of education in the development of a nation.\nAntora : That's a very important topic. Education is the backbone of a nation. If most of the people of a country remain illiterate, it can never develop.\nShanta: Yes. Illiterate people remain in the darkness of ignorance. They lack the knowledge of any kind.\nAntora : So, they can't succeed in their life let alone help in the progress of the country.\nShanta: Also, they're devoid of values and responsibilities.\nAntora : You're right. They don't hesitate to break rules. They're an obstacle towards the way of development.\nShanta: On the contrary, educated people are aware of everything, and thus, can play a vital role in the growth of the country.\nAntora : Education helps people become better citizens, and makes them loyal and responsible to their country. So, they perform their duties accordingly.\nShanta: Besides, education helps people to act wisely, and train them to use their knowledge properly.\nAntora : Thus, education provides people with the necessary skills.\nShanta: As a result, they can help themselves out of poverty. That is how they can change their condition.\nAntora : Hmm. An educated person can do a job better than an uneducated person. He can do it easily and quickly. So, if a whole nation is educated, it will develop eventually.\nShanta: A great number of people in our country are illiterate. If we want to make ourselves a developed nation, we have to make all the people educated.\nAntora : The government should take proper steps for this.\nShanta: Certainly.\nAntora : Anyway, I've to go now. See you later.\nShanta: Bye. Take care."
