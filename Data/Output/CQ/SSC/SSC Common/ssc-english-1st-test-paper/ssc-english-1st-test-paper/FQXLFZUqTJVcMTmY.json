          "explanation": "a. February 21 is a memorable day in our national history because on this day in 1952, the heroic son's of Bengal laid down their lives to establish Bangla as a state language of the undivided Pakistan. On this day, we pay tribute to the language martyrs because of their sacrifice for the rightful place of mother tongue.\nb. The then Governor General of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Zinnah, is responsible to raise a storm of protest. In a public meeting in Dhaka, he declared Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan, which disregarded the language rights of the Bangalee. Therefore, a mass protest started across the country.\nc. The Pakistani government banned all sorts of public meetings and gatherings to stop the protest that began following Mohammad Ali Jinnah's declaration of Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan and continued non-stop.\nd. Against the declaration of outlawing all sorts of public meeting and rallies, the students of Dhaka University brought out a peaceful protest procession on 21 February, defying the law.\ne. The Language Movement of 1952 kindled the sparks of independence movement in East Pakistan by making the Bangalees aware of their rights. Thus, the Language Movement is related to the independence movement of Bangladesh."

He took his graduation from the Central School of Engineering in Paris and went to work for a railway construction company. His mother thought that he would not go far. \"Be patient, mum. I've got some ideas. You'll see,\" Gustave assured his mother. For years, Gustave made plan after plan of dams, factories, stations and structures of great sized buildings. All over Europe, engineers copied them. In the middle of 1880s, a group of French industrialists persuaded the government to organize a World Fair in Paris. Oustave proposed a 989 feet tower of iron as a symbol of the fair. The construction of the tower began in January 1887. Forty engineers and designers worked under Gustave's direction for two years. The tower was finally completed in March 1889. It is the highest structure of iron made by man. No such structure had ever been constructed before. It is regarded as one of the wonders of the world.\nWrite a summary of the above passage in your own words.",

          "explanation": "Environment Pollution\nThe surroundings in which a person, animal or plant lives is called environment. There are many elements in our environment. Air, water, soil, plants, animals, etc. are such elements. They are essential for the environment as well as human beings. These elements should be sound for our sound living. But when they are polluted and their essential balance is disrupted, this phenomenon is known as environmental pollution. Nowadays, almost everywhere, the environment is being seriously polluted. In many places of our country, the environment has become extremely polluted. Actually, we ourselves are responsible for this severe pollution. Industries and factories emit huge amount of smoke, gases and fume. Motor vehicles also emit large amount of smoke and gases. All these pollute air seriously and polluted air is very harmful for us. Moreover, water is polluted due to dumping of industrial wastes and by chemical fertilizers and insecticides which are washed away into rivers and canals. Due to indiscriminate use of vehicle horns, loud speakers, mikes, etc. sound is polluted. Soil is polluted by harmful chemical fertilizers and insecticides. Besides, people are cutting down trees at random. All these are causing environmental pollution. Consequently, man becomes sick, animals and fishes are getting reduced, global warming is increasing, polar icecaps are melting, frequent floods are occurring and so on. So, we all should be aware of this harmful pollution and take effective measures to solve it."

It is praiseworthy that you're going well with your study. At the same time, I want to give you an advice to take physical exercise regularly. You know that \"A sound mind remains in a sound body.\" So, to keep your body fit, you should take physical exercise daily. You are already suffering from leg pain. Still you are not taking any sort of physical exercise. If you avoid doing exercise on a regular basis, your body will get rusty. You will feel uneasy all the times. Without soundness in your body, you will be inattentive to your study. But you should become careful of the rules of exercise. Otherwise, it may hamper your health. You must have a proper guideline for this. I think, you will inform me your details soon.\nHow're our parents? Convey my best wishes to Tuhin and Shaon. No more today.\n\nYour elder sister,\nRubina"

The sight of the piece of meat made his mouth full of water. He thought for sometimes. He hit upon a plan to have it. He said to the crow, \"Oh beautiful Crow! Your complexion is so fair. I think, you can sing nicely. Would you please sing a song for me?\" At first, the crow did not want to sing. But as the fox carried on praising her, she felt proud of her tongue. Finally, she started to sing a song. But no sooner had she opened her mouth than the piece of meat fell off from her mouth. Then the clever fox took it and ran away. The crow had paid a heavy price for his foolishness.\""

I was trying to complete an assignment last night, and the electricity went off for hours. I couldn’t finish my work on time.\nMaliha: Yes, and it’s even worse for businesses. Shops lose customers, and those relying on machines or refrigeration suffer huge losses.\nAdiat: True. Hospitals also face serious issues, especially during surgeries or when running life-support machines.\nMaliha: You’re right. The authorities need to invest more in renewable energy, like solar and wind power, to tackle this issue.\nAdiat: I agree. Also, fixing old power lines and proper maintenance could help reduce the problem.\nMaliha: Absolutely! Until then, I guess we have no choice but to endure it. Still, we should raise awareness and ask for improvements.\nAdiat: That’s a good idea, Maliha. Hopefully, things will get better soon."
