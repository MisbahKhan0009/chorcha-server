In Bangladesh poisonous exhausts from industrial plants, brick kilns, old or poorly serviced vehicles and dust from roads and construction sites are some of the major sources of air pollution. We can minimise this type of pollution by making less use of motor vehicles and avoiding the use of vehicles older than 20 years. We may also use proper lubricants to lessen the level of emission and pollutants. We can encourage people to use Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) or Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) for fuelling their cars. The government may relocate hazardous industries like brick kilns to areas away from human habitations.\n.\nAir is the most important element of human environment. Man cannot (a) —— a single moment without air. But (b) —— do not think that it is (c) —— who pollute this most vital element.

      "uddipok": "It was late summer, 26 August 1910. A little girl was born to a rich Catholic merchants' family of Albanian descent in a small town called Skopje, Macedonia. She was the youngest of the three siblings and was named Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu. Who could imagine at the time that this little girl would one day become the mother of humanity, loving and serving the poorest of the poor. Yes, we are talking about none other than Mother Teresa.\n\nAt the age of 12, she heard a voice from within that urged her to spread the love of Christ. She decided that she would be a missionary. At the age of 18 , she left her parental home. She then joined an Irish community of nuns called the Sisters of Loreto, which had missions in India.\n\nAfter a few months of training at the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Dublin, Mother Teresa came to India. On May 24, 1931, she took her initial vows as a nun. From 1931 to 1948, Mother Teresa taught geography and theology at St. Mary's High School in Kolkata (then Calcutta). However, the widespread poverty in Kolkata had a deep impact on Mother Teresa and in 1948, she received permission from her superiors to leave the convent and devote herself to caring for the poorest of the poor in the slums of Kolkata.\n\nFor the contribution to humanity, she was awarded the Noble Peace Prize in 1979. She died at the age of 87 , on 5 September, 1997.\nWrite a summary of the above passage in your own words.",

          "explanation": "Environment Pollution\nThe surroundings in which a person, animal or plant lives is called environment. There are many elements in our environment. Air, water, soil, plants, animals, etc. are such elements. They are essential for the environment as well as human beings. These elements should be sound for our sound living. But when they are polluted and their essential balance is disrupted, this phenomenon is known as environmental pollution. Nowadays, almost everywhere, the environment is being seriously polluted. In many places of our country, the environment has become extremely polluted. Actually, we ourselves are responsible for this severe pollution. Industries and factories emit huge amount of smoke, gases and fume. Motor vehicles also emit large amount of smoke and gases. All these pollute air seriously and polluted air is very harmful for us. Moreover, water is polluted due to dumping of industrial wastes and by chemical fertilizers and insecticides which are washed away into rivers and canals. Due to indiscriminate use of vehicle horns, loud speakers, mikes, etc. sound is polluted. Soil is polluted by harmful chemical fertilizers and insecticides. Besides, people are cutting down trees at random. All these are causing environmental pollution. Consequently, man becomes sick, animals and fishes are getting reduced, global warming is increasing, polar icecaps are melting, frequent floods are occurring and so on. So, we all should be aware of this harmful pollution and take effective measures to solve it."

We can talk to a person thousands of kilometres away on the phone or the Internet. So, we can communicate with the whole world easily. English has made this communication easier.\n\nThere are many countries in the world with many languages, but to communicate with them, you cannot use all the languages. So, you need a common language that you can use with more or less all the people in the world. English is that common language. You can talk to a Chinese toy maker, a French artist, an Arab ambassador or a Korean builder in one language - English.\n\nEnglish for us in Bangladesh is all the more important. As we have seen earlier, we are too many people in a small country. So, if you learn English, you have the best opportunity to find a good job, both within and outside the country. And that is good news for millions of our unemployed youths.\" \"But Miss, we learn English for 12 or 14 years, yet we do not find good jobs\", says Rumi. She then tells the class about what happened to her brother. \"Could you please tell us why?\" Rumi asks. \"This is a very important question, Rumi: We should learn how to use English both orally and in writing for doing things as needed in our work, such as communicating with others at personal, social, national and international levels. But unfortunately, at the moment we are learning English mainly for our exams,\" continues Miss Choudhury. \"Remember, English can greatly help you become skilled workers.\"\n\n\"But where and how can we learn this kind of English, Miss?\" asks Ratan. Ms Choudhury says, \"We can learn English both in ánd outside the classroom. Besides your textbooks, the radio, television, newspapers, magazines, computers and other supplementary materials will greatly help you.
