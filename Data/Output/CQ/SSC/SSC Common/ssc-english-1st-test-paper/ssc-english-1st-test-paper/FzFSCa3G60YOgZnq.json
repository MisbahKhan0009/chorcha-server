There are two major types of energy sources: renewable and non-renewable. Hydro-carbon or fossil fuels are non-renewable sources of energy. Reliance on them poses real big problems. First, fossil fuels such as oil, coal, gas, etc. are finite energy resources and the world eventually will run out of them. Secondly, they will become too expensive in the coming decades and too damaging for the environment. Thirdly, fossil fuels have direct polluting impacts on earth's environment causing global warming. In contrast, renewable energy sources such as, wind and solar energy are constantly and naturally replenished and never run out. Most renewable energy comes either directly or indirectly from the sun. Sunlight or solar energy can be used heating and lighting homes, for generating electricity and for other commercial and industrial uses. for The sun's heat drives the wind and this wind energy can be captured with wind turbines to produce electricity. Then the wind and the sun's heat cause water to evaporate. When this water vapour turns into rain or snow and flows downhill into rivers or streams, its energy can be captured as hydroelectric energy. Along with the rain and snow, sunlight causes plants to grow. Plants produce biomass which again can be turned into fuels such as fire wood, alcohol, etc. identified as bioenergy. Scientists have identified Hydrogen as another form of renewable energy source. It is the most abundant element in nature. But it does not exist separately as a gas. It is always combined with other elements, such as with oxygen to make water. Hydrogen, separated from another element, cản be burned as a fuel to produce electricity. Our Earth's interior contains molten lava which gives off extreme heat. This heat inside the Earth produces steam and hot water which can be tapped as geothermal energy to produce electricity, for heating homes, etc. Ocean -energy comes from several sources. Ocean's force of tide and wave can be used to produce energy. The surface of the ocean gets more heat from the sun than the ocean depths. This temperature difference can be used as energy source too.\nChoose the correct answer from the following alternatives:",

They include sports, music, drama, art, debate, clubs, and other extracurricular pursuits that allow students to explore their interests outside of the traditional classroom setting. These activities are important because they provide students with opportunities to develop essential life skills such as teamwork, leadership, time management, and creativity. Co-curricular activities enhance learning by making it more engaging and practical, helping students apply theoretical knowledge in real-world contexts. They also contribute to personal growth by building confidence, self-discipline, and interpersonal skills. Additionally, by participating in a variety of activities, students gain exposure to different fields, which helps them explore their passions and strengths. Finally, co-curricular activities prepare students for the future by equipping them with a diverse set of skills that are highly valued in both higher education and the job market, making them well-rounded individuals ready to face challenges in life."

Despite having few resources, he was determined to learn everything he could.\nOne day, a wealthy traveler passed through the village. Seeing the boy reading under the flickering light, he stopped and asked him about his aspirations. The boy explained his situation and his dream of studying further. The traveler, impressed by his determination and thirst for knowledge, offered to sponsor the boy’s education.\nThe boy was overjoyed and gratefully accepted the offer.

          "explanation": "Subject: Causes and Effects of Road Accidents in Bangladesh\nDear Nafis,\nI hope you're doing well and everything is great on your end! I received your message and your concern about the frequent road accidents in Bangladesh. It’s definitely an issue that’s causing a lot of distress here, and I appreciate that you care about it.\nThe main causes of road accidents in Bangladesh are numerous, and many of them stem from both human errors and infrastructure-related issues. One of the primary causes is reckless driving, which includes speeding, overtaking dangerously, and not following traffic rules. There’s also the issue of poor road conditions in many areas—potholes, lack of proper signage, and narrow lanes make driving hazardous. The absence of proper pedestrian crossings and traffic lights in certain areas also adds to the problem.\nAnother factor is the increasing number of vehicles on the roads, which has led to congestion and drivers sometimes feeling impatient. Many drivers don’t respect traffic signals or signs, and there is a lack of proper enforcement of laws, which makes things worse. Poor visibility at night due to a lack of streetlights and the use of mobile phones while driving are also significant contributors.\nThe effects of these accidents are devastating. Loss of life is the most tragic impact, with thousands of families affected each year. Those who survive often suffer from serious injuries, many of which require long-term treatment or result in permanent disabilities. Apart from the human cost, the economic impact is also severe. The government and families bear the medical and rehabilitation expenses, and accidents often cause traffic jams that affect daily life and productivity.\nIt’s clear that urgent action is needed, from improving road infrastructure to better enforcement of traffic laws and educating the public about road safety. There’s also a need for stricter penalties for those who break the law and more investment in public transportation to reduce the number of cars on the road.\nI hope this gives you a clearer picture of the situation. Let’s hope that over time, things will improve as more attention is given to this issue.\nTake care, and keep in touch!\nWarm regards, Arpita Chattogram, Bangladesh\n"
