          "question": "",
          "explanation": "(a) Humans can neither change the sun's radiation nor the earth's orbit around the sun, because these things are beyond their control.\n\n(b) Human beings do some unwise activities like burning too much fossil fuels, setting up more factories, cutting down trees indiscriminately, etc. that result in the increase of greenhouse gases. Thus, they are responsible for the increase in the greenhouse gases.\n\n(c) I think the main cause of the increase in carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels. With the increase of industrial activities, the combustion of coal has increased. Besides coal, mineral oil and natural gas are also burned for various purposes. Thus, every time a fossil raw material is burned, it releases carbon dioxide into the air.\n\n(d) Enormous areas of forests are destroyed by the people every year to obtain wood and to clear regions for mining and to create pasture."

          "explanation": "Environment Pollution\nThe surroundings in which a person, animal or plant lives is called environment. There are many elements in our environment. Air, water, soil, plants, animals, etc. are such elements. They are essential for the environment as well as human beings. These elements should be sound for our sound living. But when they are polluted and their essential balance is disrupted, this phenomenon is known as environmental pollution. Nowadays, almost everywhere, the environment is being seriously polluted. In many places of our country, the environment has become extremely polluted. Actually, we ourselves are responsible for this severe pollution. Industries and factories emit huge amount of smoke, gases and fume. Motor vehicles also emit large amount of smoke and gases. All these pollute air seriously and polluted air is very harmful for us. Moreover, water is polluted due to dumping of industrial wastes and by chemical fertilizers and insecticides which are washed away into rivers and canals. Due to indiscriminate use of vehicle horns, loud speakers, mikes, etc. sound is polluted. Soil is polluted by harmful chemical fertilizers and insecticides. Besides, people are cutting down trees at random. All these are causing environmental pollution. Consequently, man becomes sick, animals and fishes are getting reduced, global warming is increasing, polar icecaps are melting, frequent floods are occurring and so on. So, we all should be aware of this harmful pollution and take effective measures to solve it."

As our exam is knocking at the door, I want to share some tips on how you can do well in the exam.\nFirst, make a study plan. Divide your subjects based on the topics and set achievable goals for each day. This will help you stay organized and cover all the topics including the ones, which seem difficult to you. Be regular in classes and attentive to the teachers' lessons. Keep notes of the classes. Read the textbooks thoroughly and try to solve the problems. Next, practise previous years' exam papers. This will give you a clear idea of the question patterns and time management. Besides, it can boost your confidence. Don't forget to take regular breaks while studying. Short breaks can help you stay focused and fresh. Try using the Pomodoro technique-study for 25 minutes, then take a 5 -minute break. Stay healthy. Get enough sleep, eat well, and stay hydrated. Remember, a healthy body supports a healthy mind. Lastly, stay positive. Believe in yourself and your abilities. Stressing too much won't help, so try to stay calm and focused.\nI'm confident that you will do.great. Let me know if you need any more tips or if you want to study together:\nBest of luck!\nYour friend,\nAmrin"
