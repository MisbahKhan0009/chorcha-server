          "explanation": "a. February 21 is a memorable day in our national history because on this day in 1952, the heroic son's of Bengal laid down their lives to establish Bangla as a state language of the undivided Pakistan. On this day, we pay tribute to the language martyrs because of their sacrifice for the rightful place of mother tongue.\nb. The then Governor General of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Zinnah, is responsible to raise a storm of protest. In a public meeting in Dhaka, he declared Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan, which disregarded the language rights of the Bangalee. Therefore, a mass protest started across the country.\nc. The Pakistani government banned all sorts of public meetings and gatherings to stop the protest that began following Mohammad Ali Jinnah's declaration of Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan and continued non-stop.\nd. Against the declaration of outlawing all sorts of public meeting and rallies, the students of Dhaka University brought out a peaceful protest procession on 21 February, defying the law.\ne. The Language Movement of 1952 kindled the sparks of independence movement in East Pakistan by making the Bangalees aware of their rights. Thus, the Language Movement is related to the independence movement of Bangladesh."

It is hard for her illiterate parents to earn enough to run the family well. Dilara hopes to bring about a change to her family by receiving higher education. So she makes a promise to herself to study well from here on. One of her teachers once told her that there are schools in Swapnopur that offers scholarship to bright students. Getting a scholarship, would help her pursue the promise she made to herself. So, with strong determination and hard work, Dilara got good results in her final examinations. The school gifted her and other top students a bundle of books to applaud their effort. Dilara finished reading all of her book long before New Year. She was motivated by the idea that if she worked hard, a positive outcome would follow. However, the journey ahead proved to be a challenge. There is not always a positive outcome no matter how hard one works. But Dilara's old promise helped her stand firm on her ground. No matter how uncertain the future would be, she decided to never let uncertainty affect her present."

          "explanation": "Subject: Causes and Effects of Road Accidents in Bangladesh\nDear Nafis,\nI hope you're doing well and everything is great on your end! I received your message and your concern about the frequent road accidents in Bangladesh. It’s definitely an issue that’s causing a lot of distress here, and I appreciate that you care about it.\nThe main causes of road accidents in Bangladesh are numerous, and many of them stem from both human errors and infrastructure-related issues. One of the primary causes is reckless driving, which includes speeding, overtaking dangerously, and not following traffic rules. There’s also the issue of poor road conditions in many areas—potholes, lack of proper signage, and narrow lanes make driving hazardous. The absence of proper pedestrian crossings and traffic lights in certain areas also adds to the problem.\nAnother factor is the increasing number of vehicles on the roads, which has led to congestion and drivers sometimes feeling impatient. Many drivers don’t respect traffic signals or signs, and there is a lack of proper enforcement of laws, which makes things worse. Poor visibility at night due to a lack of streetlights and the use of mobile phones while driving are also significant contributors.\nThe effects of these accidents are devastating. Loss of life is the most tragic impact, with thousands of families affected each year. Those who survive often suffer from serious injuries, many of which require long-term treatment or result in permanent disabilities. Apart from the human cost, the economic impact is also severe. The government and families bear the medical and rehabilitation expenses, and accidents often cause traffic jams that affect daily life and productivity.\nIt’s clear that urgent action is needed, from improving road infrastructure to better enforcement of traffic laws and educating the public about road safety. There’s also a need for stricter penalties for those who break the law and more investment in public transportation to reduce the number of cars on the road.\nI hope this gives you a clearer picture of the situation. Let’s hope that over time, things will improve as more attention is given to this issue.\nTake care, and keep in touch!\nWarm regards, Arpita Chattogram, Bangladesh\n"

Thus, they are responsible for the increase in the greenhouse gases.\n\n(c) I think the main cause of the increase in carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels. With the increase of industrial activities, the combustion of coal has increased. Besides coal, mineral oil and natural gas are also burned for various purposes. Thus, every time a fossil raw material is burned, it releases carbon dioxide into the air.\n\n(d) Enormous areas of forests are destroyed by the people every year to obtain wood and to clear regions for mining and to create pasture."
