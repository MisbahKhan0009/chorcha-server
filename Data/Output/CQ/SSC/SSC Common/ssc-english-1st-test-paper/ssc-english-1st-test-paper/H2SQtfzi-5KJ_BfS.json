          "question": "",
          "explanation": "(a) Humans can neither change the sun's radiation nor the earth's orbit around the sun, because these things are beyond their control.\n\n(b) Human beings do some unwise activities like burning too much fossil fuels, setting up more factories, cutting down trees indiscriminately, etc. that result in the increase of greenhouse gases. Thus, they are responsible for the increase in the greenhouse gases.\n\n(c) I think the main cause of the increase in carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels. With the increase of industrial activities, the combustion of coal has increased. Besides coal, mineral oil and natural gas are also burned for various purposes. Thus, every time a fossil raw material is burned, it releases carbon dioxide into the air.\n\n(d) Enormous areas of forests are destroyed by the people every year to obtain wood and to clear regions for mining and to create pasture."

      "uddipok": "Interpol is the International Criminal Police Organization. It comes from the two words \"International\" and \"Police\". It stands for International Criminal Police Commission. It is a nonpolitical, non-racial and non-religious organization. Almost all the countries of the world are the members of this organization. So, all the nations cooperate with one another to trace criminals around the world. Its headquarters is in Lyon. According to international law, the police of one country cannot enter the territory of another country to catch the criminals. In such situations, Interpol helps to trace out the criminals. Every country has its representatives in Interpol. After the First World War, crimes increased considerably in Europe, especially in Austria. After committing crimes, the criminals used to go to some neighboring countries and hide themselves there. In order to arrest such criminals, John Scober, the then Police Chief of Vienna, called a meeting of the police officials of different countries in 1923. It was in this meeting that twenty countries jointly established Interpol. Its first head office was made in Vienna and John Scober became its President.\nIn 1938, Germany invaded Austria and, caused end to Interpol. After the Second World War, Flaurent Lovagy, Inspector General of Belgium Police revived it. Lyon became its new headquarters. In 1956, Interpol was given a new constitution.\nWrite a summary of the above passage in your own words.",

          "explanation": "Climate Change\nClimate change is the most important issue at present world. Its impact will be severely negative on both mankind and nature. The causes of climate change can be divided into two categories. They are due to natural causes and the causes created by men. Global warming is the main natural cause while using harmful chemicals in everyday life is the main cause created by man. The climate is changing rapidly that results in the rise of average temperature of the earth. The global climate changes and its consequences are leaving a bad impact on the developing countries like Bangladesh. The serious consequences of climate change are rising of temperature, erratic rainfall, floods, cyclones, draught, melting of polar ice-caps etc. which seriously affect the livings of the people of poorer countries. Bangladesh, for its geographical location, is likely to be the most affected. The developed nations which are more responsible for such climate changes should take responsibilities to protect the victimized countries. A one-meter rising of sea-level will submerge about one-third of the total area of Bangladesh which will uproot 25 − 30 25-30 25 − 30 million people of the country. These people will become refugees. To minimize the climate change, people should be aware. Tree plantation can reduce global warming. Avoiding the usage of harmful chemicals can reduce environmental pollution. Students should take necessary steps to protect the environment and raise awareness. They can make people aware of the bad sides of climate change. Thus, they can play a vital role to minimize the climate change."

Once, on his way to the king's court, the poet took shelter in a nobleman's house for a night. He was then wearing a very ordinary and cheap cloth. The nobleman could not recognize him and did not behave well with him. On the next day, Sheikh Saadi left the place for the court of the king and was received with honour. He stayed there for a few days and received rich gifts from the king. On his way back to home, he again visited that rich man's house wearing a costly and gorgeous dress. This time, the rich man treated him with the best of the foods and comfort. While eating, he was surprised to see the rich delicious food and understood the rich man's attitude. Sheikh Saadi then instead of eating the food, started putting them into the pockets of his rich cloth. Being astonished, the rich man asked him about his mysterious\nbehaviour. The poet answered that the given food was for his dress as he failed to get same treatment when he was in very simple dress. The rich man realized his earlier folly and became ashamed."
