Climate change is increasing the water temperature in rivers, lakes and seas. This means there is less food and oxygen available for fish. It also means the fish may not grow fully and may have fewer offsprings. Some fishes will become extinct if temperatures rise even by one or two degrees celsius.\nClimate change increases the pressure on fish population. Fishes are one of the world's most valuable biological assets. Forty percent of people in the world eat fish as their main source of protein. If we fail to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we will increase the pressure on fish. As a result, people who depend on fish will suffer from hunger and poverty.\n\nQuestion:\nIt is (a) — from the passage that global warming is (b) — great threat for fish population. (c) — global warming, food production and oxygen (d) — in water decrease. As a result, some fishes may be extinct (e) ——.",

          "explanation": "Tree Plantation\nTree plantation means planting trees on a large scale in a planned way. Trees are our friends. They give us shade and soothe our eyes with their green colour. They give us various kinds of fruits. They give us firewood as fuel for cooking. They give us timber for furniture, doors and windows, boats, electric poles, railway slippers, etc. They give us rubber too. Trees take in carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. Sufficient trees cause sufficient rainfall and prevent draught. Trees along the roadside and coastal areas preyent erosion and tidal bore. But many inconsiderate pcople are cutting down trees for their selfish interests. So, we are losing trees. If there is no tree, there will be no civilization. In fact, the loss of trees will take our existence to the verge of extinction. The earth will be no more habitable. Hence, tree plantation must be taken as a project. The more we plant trees, the morė our environment will be balanced and greener. In Bangladesh, tree plantation is compulsory because we do not have as much forest as we require to maintain the ecological balance. There is no specific time to plant trees. We can plant trees any time of the year based on the type of the trees. Park, yard, urban areas, open field, balcony, rooftops; roadside places, etc. are best places to plant trees. To make life peaceful, there is no alternative to tree plantation."

Being defeated for six times, he lost his hope. Getting disappointed, he took shelter in a remote cave. Once, he was lying in the cave. Then he saw a spider trying hard to reach the ceiling of the cave. The spider failed again and again to succeed. But he did not give up hope. Bruce saw the spider climbing to the ceiling 'after some unsuccessful attempts. This dauntless spider inspired Bruce to shake off the darkness of despair. He gathered an army of strong men and attacked his enemies. The enemies courted defeat and Bruce regained his kingdom. It taught us that; 'perseverance is the key to success'."

It is praiseworthy that you're going well with your study. At the same time, I want to give you an advice to take physical exercise regularly. You know that \"A sound mind remains in a sound body.\" So, to keep your body fit, you should take physical exercise daily. You are already suffering from leg pain. Still you are not taking any sort of physical exercise. If you avoid doing exercise on a regular basis, your body will get rusty. You will feel uneasy all the times. Without soundness in your body, you will be inattentive to your study. But you should become careful of the rules of exercise. Otherwise, it may hamper your health. You must have a proper guideline for this. I think, you will inform me your details soon.\nHow're our parents? Convey my best wishes to Tuhin and Shaon. No more today.\n\nYour elder sister,\nRubina"

          "explanation": "Subject: Causes and Effects of Road Accidents in Bangladesh\nDear Nafis,\nI hope you're doing well and everything is great on your end! I received your message and your concern about the frequent road accidents in Bangladesh. It’s definitely an issue that’s causing a lot of distress here, and I appreciate that you care about it.\nThe main causes of road accidents in Bangladesh are numerous, and many of them stem from both human errors and infrastructure-related issues. One of the primary causes is reckless driving, which includes speeding, overtaking dangerously, and not following traffic rules. There’s also the issue of poor road conditions in many areas—potholes, lack of proper signage, and narrow lanes make driving hazardous. The absence of proper pedestrian crossings and traffic lights in certain areas also adds to the problem.\nAnother factor is the increasing number of vehicles on the roads, which has led to congestion and drivers sometimes feeling impatient. Many drivers don’t respect traffic signals or signs, and there is a lack of proper enforcement of laws, which makes things worse. Poor visibility at night due to a lack of streetlights and the use of mobile phones while driving are also significant contributors.\nThe effects of these accidents are devastating. Loss of life is the most tragic impact, with thousands of families affected each year. Those who survive often suffer from serious injuries, many of which require long-term treatment or result in permanent disabilities. Apart from the human cost, the economic impact is also severe. The government and families bear the medical and rehabilitation expenses, and accidents often cause traffic jams that affect daily life and productivity.\nIt’s clear that urgent action is needed, from improving road infrastructure to better enforcement of traffic laws and educating the public about road safety. There’s also a need for stricter penalties for those who break the law and more investment in public transportation to reduce the number of cars on the road.\nI hope this gives you a clearer picture of the situation. Let’s hope that over time, things will improve as more attention is given to this issue.\nTake care, and keep in touch!\nWarm regards, Arpita Chattogram, Bangladesh\n"
