He pointed out that the era of wood and bio-mass has almost come to an end. The age of oil and natural gas would soon be over within the next few decades. Massive burning of world's coal reserves may lead to a worldwide ecological disaster because coal burning emits the highest amount of carbon in the atmosphere. So according to Kalam, the only solution that mankind can look to is the massive use of solar energy in future because it has some advantages over other forms of renewable energies. Now why has Kalam put so much importance to the issue of energy? The energy sources have always been a major factor of change throughout history. The world's petroleum consumption has increased from 3 billion barrels annually in 1930 to 37 billion barrels annually today. In the next quarter century, the world's population is expected to be about 8 billion which is 30 percent higher than today. Developing countries will grow their economics about two times faster than industrialised countries. Global economic growth is expected to continue at 3 percent per year. Consequently, the global demand for energy will grow at about 1.7 percent per year on an average. It indicates a 50 percent rise of energy consumption by 2030. If the world's daily petroleum consumption is 100 million barrels now, it will rise to 150 million barrels by that time. The present reserve of hydro-carbon energy resources is limited and it will not be sufficient to meet the future energy challenges of the world. And hence, leading industrial countries have taken initiatives to tap alternative energy sources mainly known as green or renewable energy sources. The bottom line of Kalam's speech indicates concern of mankind in 21 st century.\n\nMr. APJ Abdul Kalam was not only a scientist but also the President of India. At the 90 th 90^{\\text {th }} 9 0 th science congress, he (a)____ a speech on the aspect of mankind's future energy crisis. He (b)____ pressure on the (c) ____ of solar energy. (d) ____ to the history, the energy sources have always been a major factor of change. All the general people should have a (e) ____ about the fact.",

          "explanation": "Early Rising\n\nEarly rising is a positive habit. It means that we should get up from bed early in the morning to enable ourselves to be ready for a new day. This fact, when made into a regular habit, will surely lead us to a world of bliss and prosperity. A proverb says, \"Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.\" Early rising has many benefits. The man who rises early in the morning can take some exercises or a walk in the fresh air by the riverside or in the open field. It makes our minds fresh and lively. Early in the morning, nature seems quiet and calm. No hue and cry are heard then. Nature smiles in the morning with colourful flowers and green leaves. Birds begin to chirp. These beautiful gifts and colourful nature in the morning remind everybody of the Creator. One feels like praying to the Almighty: But it is not easy to attain this quality. Sleeping late at night does not help in early rising. So, to rise early from bed, we have to go to bed early. An early riser enjoys the surroundings very much and gets enough time to do his work either in study or in other work, which will bring him success. On the contrary, if one gets up late, the schedule of his work becomes interrupted. Above all, early rising keeps us healthy and cheerful. For all these reasons, we all should cultivate the habit of early rising."

          "explanation": "a. February 21 is a memorable day in our national history because on this day in 1952, the heroic son's of Bengal laid down their lives to establish Bangla as a state language of the undivided Pakistan. On this day, we pay tribute to the language martyrs because of their sacrifice for the rightful place of mother tongue.\nb. The then Governor General of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Zinnah, is responsible to raise a storm of protest. In a public meeting in Dhaka, he declared Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan, which disregarded the language rights of the Bangalee. Therefore, a mass protest started across the country.\nc. The Pakistani government banned all sorts of public meetings and gatherings to stop the protest that began following Mohammad Ali Jinnah's declaration of Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan and continued non-stop.\nd. Against the declaration of outlawing all sorts of public meeting and rallies, the students of Dhaka University brought out a peaceful protest procession on 21 February, defying the law.\ne. The Language Movement of 1952 kindled the sparks of independence movement in East Pakistan by making the Bangalees aware of their rights. Thus, the Language Movement is related to the independence movement of Bangladesh."
