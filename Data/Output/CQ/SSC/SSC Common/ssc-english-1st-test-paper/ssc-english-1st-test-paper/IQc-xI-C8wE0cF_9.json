          "explanation": "a. February 21 is a memorable day in our national history because on this day in 1952, the heroic son's of Bengal laid down their lives to establish Bangla as a state language of the undivided Pakistan. On this day, we pay tribute to the language martyrs because of their sacrifice for the rightful place of mother tongue.\nb. The then Governor General of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Zinnah, is responsible to raise a storm of protest. In a public meeting in Dhaka, he declared Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan, which disregarded the language rights of the Bangalee. Therefore, a mass protest started across the country.\nc. The Pakistani government banned all sorts of public meetings and gatherings to stop the protest that began following Mohammad Ali Jinnah's declaration of Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan and continued non-stop.\nd. Against the declaration of outlawing all sorts of public meeting and rallies, the students of Dhaka University brought out a peaceful protest procession on 21 February, defying the law.\ne. The Language Movement of 1952 kindled the sparks of independence movement in East Pakistan by making the Bangalees aware of their rights. Thus, the Language Movement is related to the independence movement of Bangladesh."

      "uddipok": "Rabindranath Tagore was one of the most leading poets in the history of world literature. He was at the same time a poet, a novelist, a dramatist, a philosopher and a musician. He was born in the renowned Tagore family on 7May, 1861. After the completion of his house education, he was sent to school. But he did not like institutional education. So, arrangements were made at house for his proper education. In his thirteenth year, Rabindranath along with his father went to visit Himalayas. At the age of seventeen, he was sent to London to study law. But he studied literature with Professor Henry Morley only for a few months and then returned home. Only at the age of eight, he started composing poems. He wrote his poetic novel Banaphul at the age of fifteen. When he was sixteen, his poems and essays were being published in journals. After returning from England, he began to write tirelessly in all branches of literature. In 1911, he translated his poems of \"The Gitanjali\" into English which brought him the highest honour in the form of the Nobel Prize in 1913.\nOne year after his awarding of the Nobel Prize, he was made a knight by the British Government which he rejected as a protest against the atrocities of British Government at Jalianwalabagh. The University of Oxford honoured him with D.Litt., in 1940. Earlier in 1921, he laid the foundation of Viswa Bharati. At the age of eighty, Rabindranath Tagore breathed his last.\n\nWrite a summary of the above passage in your own words.",

          "explanation": "Environment Pollution\nThe surroundings in which a person, animal or plant lives is called environment. There are many elements in our environment. Air, water, soil, plants, animals, etc. are such elements. They are essential for the environment as well as human beings. These elements should be sound for our sound living. But when they are polluted and their essential balance is disrupted, this phenomenon is known as environmental pollution. Nowadays, almost everywhere, the environment is being seriously polluted. In many places of our country, the environment has become extremely polluted. Actually, we ourselves are responsible for this severe pollution. Industries and factories emit huge amount of smoke, gases and fume. Motor vehicles also emit large amount of smoke and gases. All these pollute air seriously and polluted air is very harmful for us. Moreover, water is polluted due to dumping of industrial wastes and by chemical fertilizers and insecticides which are washed away into rivers and canals. Due to indiscriminate use of vehicle horns, loud speakers, mikes, etc. sound is polluted. Soil is polluted by harmful chemical fertilizers and insecticides. Besides, people are cutting down trees at random. All these are causing environmental pollution. Consequently, man becomes sick, animals and fishes are getting reduced, global warming is increasing, polar icecaps are melting, frequent floods are occurring and so on. So, we all should be aware of this harmful pollution and take effective measures to solve it."

Rather going to a coaching center, he memorizes answers from guide books and sheets and finds that he cannot cut a good figure in the exams. One day, his class teacher called him and asked why he depended on guidebooks and memorized answers without understanding anything. Adib replied, \"I have been doing that since childhood. Both of my parents are illiterate, so they can't help me with my studies. In the coaching center, the teachers only provide sheets and ask us to memorize the answers.\" Hearing this, the teacher became very disappointed. He said to Adib, \"Listen, Adib! Ours is a creative curriculum. In this system of education, memorization will never help you. You must read and understand your textbooks thoroughly. Then you will be able to answer the creative questions. I know you're a brilliant student and capable of handling the creative curriculum.\" Adib understood his mistake and promised his class teacher that he would no longer depend on coaching centers, guidebooks, and sheets. He said, \"From now on, I will be regular and attentive in class and take notes during lectures.\" His teacher became happy and said, \"That's very good. If you need any help, don't hesitate to come to me.\""

          "explanation": "Subject: Causes and Effects of Road Accidents in Bangladesh\nDear Nafis,\nI hope you're doing well and everything is great on your end! I received your message and your concern about the frequent road accidents in Bangladesh. It’s definitely an issue that’s causing a lot of distress here, and I appreciate that you care about it.\nThe main causes of road accidents in Bangladesh are numerous, and many of them stem from both human errors and infrastructure-related issues. One of the primary causes is reckless driving, which includes speeding, overtaking dangerously, and not following traffic rules. There’s also the issue of poor road conditions in many areas—potholes, lack of proper signage, and narrow lanes make driving hazardous. The absence of proper pedestrian crossings and traffic lights in certain areas also adds to the problem.\nAnother factor is the increasing number of vehicles on the roads, which has led to congestion and drivers sometimes feeling impatient. Many drivers don’t respect traffic signals or signs, and there is a lack of proper enforcement of laws, which makes things worse. Poor visibility at night due to a lack of streetlights and the use of mobile phones while driving are also significant contributors.\nThe effects of these accidents are devastating. Loss of life is the most tragic impact, with thousands of families affected each year. Those who survive often suffer from serious injuries, many of which require long-term treatment or result in permanent disabilities. Apart from the human cost, the economic impact is also severe. The government and families bear the medical and rehabilitation expenses, and accidents often cause traffic jams that affect daily life and productivity.\nIt’s clear that urgent action is needed, from improving road infrastructure to better enforcement of traffic laws and educating the public about road safety. There’s also a need for stricter penalties for those who break the law and more investment in public transportation to reduce the number of cars on the road.\nI hope this gives you a clearer picture of the situation. Let’s hope that over time, things will improve as more attention is given to this issue.\nTake care, and keep in touch!\nWarm regards, Arpita Chattogram, Bangladesh\n"
