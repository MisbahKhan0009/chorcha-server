We can talk to a person thousands of kilometres away on the phone or the Internet. So, we can communicate with the whole world easily. English has made this communication easier.\n\nThere are many countries in the world with many languages, but to communicate with them, you cannot use all the languages. So, you need a common language that you can use with more or less all the people in the world. English is that common language. You can talk to a Chinese toy maker, a French artist, an Arab ambassador or a Korean builder in one language - English.\n\nEnglish for us in Bangladesh is all the more important. As we have seen earlier, we are too many people in a small country. So, if you learn English, you have the best opportunity to find a good job, both within and outside the country. And that is good news for millions of our unemployed youths.\" \"But Miss, we learn English for 12 or 14 years, yet we do not find good jobs\", says Rumi. She then tells the class about what happened to her brother. \"Could you please tell us why?\" Rumi asks. \"This is a very important question, Rumi: We should learn how to use English both orally and in writing for doing things as needed in our work, such as communicating with others at personal, social, national and international levels. But unfortunately, at the moment we are learning English mainly for our exams,\" continues Miss Choudhury. \"Remember, English can greatly help you become skilled workers.\"\n\n\"But where and how can we learn this kind of English, Miss?\" asks Ratan. Ms Choudhury says, \"We can learn English both in ánd outside the classroom. Besides your textbooks, the radio, television, newspapers, magazines, computers and other supplementary materials will greatly help you. During our classroom activities, we'll see how we can learn English.\"\nMatch the parts of the sentences in column A A A , column B B B and column C C C to write four complete sentences.\nColumn A\nColumn B\nColumn C\n(a) Nowadays we can communicate\n(i) to get a good job both inside and outside the country\n(i) and that is English\n(b) But the language\n(ii) with a person living anywhere in the world\n(ii) by learning English\n(c) To communicate with anyone living anywhere\n(iii) is not the same\n(iii) on the phone or the internet\n(d) One can have an opportunity\n(iv) we need a common language\n(iv) in all the countries",

          "explanation": "Price Hike\nPrice hike means rise in prices of essential commodities. It is a common phenomenon in our country. The prices of essential commodities are increasing by leaps and bounds. Indeed, price of daily commodities has gone beyond the reach of the common people. There are many causes of price hike. Insufficient supply of daily commodities is mainly responsible for price hike. Our population is increasing rapidly, but our food production is not increasing proportionately. For this, we do not get enough food in comparison to our increasing demands. Moreover, frequent natural disasters like flood, drought, cyclone, etc. hamper our food production, which accelerates the price hike of essential food items. On the other hand, hoarding is another important factor of soaring price level. Some dishonest traders devoid of morality hoard essential goods and create artificial shortage in the market. Then they sell the goods at higher price. Political unrest like strikes is also responsible for a surge in price. Lack of market supervision, black marketing and smuggling also contribute to price hike. The phenomenon has increased the suffering of the common people. The poor and the middle class are mostly affected by it. But, the worst sufferers of it are those who live from hand to mouth. They find it hard to feed their family members. Some of them remain half- fed. As a result, they suffer from malnutrition. Unusual price hike hampers the economic balance of a country. The government should take effective steps to tackle the situation, most notably by increasing food production. Each and every shop must have a price chart fixed by the government. The law enforcing agencies should be deployed in the market places to monitor the market price, Legal actions must be taken against the dishonest businessmen and hoarders. Actually, people of all walks of life should also co- operate with the government."

          "explanation": "Pranks Are Not Always Fun\nLoad shedding is a common phenomenon in Bangladesh. During load shedding I would like to go on my terrace to enjoy fresh air specially at night. Last night, at 12:30 am when the electricity went off for a long time, I decided to spend some time on the terrace. I went there and after some time, I felt like someone was following me though I could not see anyone and a cold sweating grasped me. I got frightened when my phone rang. It was an unknown number. I thought it might be an emergency or something scary to me. My father was out on an official tour and suddenly it came to my mind that something might have happened to him. I received the call and asked who it was. No one replied but I heard that someone heaved a deep sigh.\nIt made me more scared and I repeated the same question. But the result was same; no one replied. After six or seven minutes, suddenly someone burst into laughter and hung up the phone. I was utterly horrified and confused. That incident made me so disturbed that I couldn't even concentrate on my studies anymore after coming downstairs. The next day, after finishing the exam, I came across a neighbour who revealed that he played a prank on me last night. He was just walking a little far from me on the opposite section of terrace and was trying to frighten me. I was so shocked that I asked for a reasonable answer. He told that he loved to play pranks on others but he meant no harm. I advised him not to do that again. All of us must be careful about our actions and shouldn't do anything which hampers the peace of others' minds.\n"

Our team played exceptionally welt, with great energy and skill. The crowd was buzzing with excitement, and the atmosphere was electric.\nBangladesh hit in full swing, dominating the opposition. The batsmen, Liton and Mushfiq, were in top form, confidently scoring 205 runs together, while our bowlers displayed remarkable control. Fizz was bowling like a magician, taking 6 wickets. Our spinners also bowled well. Finally, Bangladesh won with 5 wickets in hand. It felt amazing to witness such nerve-wrecking cricket in our own country. Looking forward to hearing from you.\n\nBest regards,\nNahid\n"

It's heart-breaking to think about the families living in those vulnerable areas.\nAsha : Yes, the frequency and intensity of these cyclones are rising due to climate change.

Crops are getting damaged, and food security is becoming a major concern.\n\nAsha : I believe we need to focus on both mitigation and adaptation strategies. People need to understand the urgency of the situation and how they can contribute to slowing down climate change.

With the increase of industrial activities, the combustion of coal has increased. Besides coal, mineral oil and natural gas are also burned for various purposes.
