Unlike wall art, which is typically organized and sanctioned, graffiti thrives on immediacy, spontaneity, and the risk of persecution. Where wall art may take time and care, graffiti is often quick, requiring speed and anonymity due to the threat of detection. Its purpose is to challenge power, counter surveillance, and inşcribe messages that are otherwise censored or suppressed. The July uprising brought new dimensions to this medium of dissent. Spray-painted slogans defied erasure, embodying collective rage and revolutionary solidarity. Demands like \"Ek dofa ek dabi, shoirachar tui kobe jabi?\" surfaced as cries for justice, echoing the French philosopher Jacques Derrida's assertion that “What cannot be said... must not be silenced but written.\" A strong sense of inclusivity was also reflected in the wall art and graffiti during and after the July uprising, which highlighted the case of the marginalized and minoritized pęople in mulțiple instances. Numerous graffiti and. wall art pieces not only called for justice but also carried a broader message of liberation, \"Not a land of one nation, Bangladesh is a land of many communities\" symbolizing the interconnected struggles of all communities. It underscored the message i.e. our collective liberation is intertwined, with the fight for justice uníting people across regions and backgrounds. The true power of graffiti lies in its resilience; it persists as a medium for revolutionary memory and collective consciousness. It speaks for those silenced, ensures the struggles of the marginalized endure, and, as Banksy's words suggest, comforts the disturbed while disturbing the comfortable.\nChoose the best answer from the alternatives:",

          "explanation": "Myself: Father, have you noticed how dengue fever is spreading rapidly these days?\nFather: Yes, my child. It has become a serious health problem in our country, especially during the rainy. season.\n\nMyself: I heard that dengue is caused by the bite of the Aedes mosquito. Is that true?\nFather: Exactly. The Aedes aegypti mosquito carries the virus. It usually breeds in stagnant water around houses.\n\nMyself: What- are the main symptoms of dengue fever?\nFather: High fever, severe headache, pain in the joints and muscles, and sometimes skin rashes. In serious cases, it can even cause bleeding.\n\nMyself: I also heard that dengue patients often suffer from a drop in platelet count.\nFather: That's correct. A dangerously low platelet count can lead to internal bleeding, which makes dengue very risky. Doctors usually monitor platelet levels closely during treatment.\n\nMyself: That sounds dangerous. How can we prevent it?\nFather: We must keep our surroundings clean, remove stagnant water, and use mosquito nets or repellents. Wearing full-sleeved clothes also helps.\n\nMyself : I think awareness is very important. People should know how to protect themselves.\nFather: Absolutely. Prevention is better than cure. If anyone shows symptoms, they should go to the doctor immediately.\n\nMyself: Thank you, Baba. I'lI share this information with my friends so they can stay safe toо.\nFather : That's a good idea, my child. Together we can fight dengue by being careful and responsible."
