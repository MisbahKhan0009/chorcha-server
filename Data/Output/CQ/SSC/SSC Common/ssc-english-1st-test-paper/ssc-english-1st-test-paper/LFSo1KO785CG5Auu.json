          "explanation": "a. February 21 is a memorable day in our national history because on this day in 1952, the heroic son's of Bengal laid down their lives to establish Bangla as a state language of the undivided Pakistan. On this day, we pay tribute to the language martyrs because of their sacrifice for the rightful place of mother tongue.\nb. The then Governor General of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Zinnah, is responsible to raise a storm of protest. In a public meeting in Dhaka, he declared Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan, which disregarded the language rights of the Bangalee. Therefore, a mass protest started across the country.\nc. The Pakistani government banned all sorts of public meetings and gatherings to stop the protest that began following Mohammad Ali Jinnah's declaration of Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan and continued non-stop.\nd. Against the declaration of outlawing all sorts of public meeting and rallies, the students of Dhaka University brought out a peaceful protest procession on 21 February, defying the law.\ne. The Language Movement of 1952 kindled the sparks of independence movement in East Pakistan by making the Bangalees aware of their rights. Thus, the Language Movement is related to the independence movement of Bangladesh."

          "explanation": "Traffic Jam\n\nTraffic jam is a situation in which a long line of vehicles on a road have stopped moving or are moving very slowly. Nowadays, traffic jam is a common problem in our towns and cities. It causes great sufferings to the passengers and the passers-by. The increasing number of vehicles mostly causes traffic jam. Day by day, the number of vehicles is increasing to meet the needs of the increased population. But the roads are not increasing in that proportion. Many vehicles moving on the same road at a timé' cause traffic jąm. Many drivers do not abide by traffic rules. Besides, the traffic police are not sincere. The tendency of the bus drivers and conductors to get more passengers also causes traffic jam. Some drivers stop buses here and there and board and unboard passengers. This hampers the movement of other vehicles and causes traffic jam. The unlimited number of rickshaws plying on the streets is another cause of traffic jam. The general people have to face untold sufferings. They reach late at their working places. Students, employees, businessmen, workers all suffer tremendously for this. It occurs mostly during office and school or college time. During fraffic jam, we feel extremely bored as it kills our valuable time. To relieve the passengers of the sufferings of traffic jam, some steps should be taken by the government. The drivers who do not abide by traffic rules should be punished. Traffic authority should be active to enforce the traffic rules and maintain the discipline on the roads."

On the eve of his departure from home, his mother said to him, \"My son, never tell a lie and don't get frightened in danger.\"\n\nWith these words in his heart, he set out on his journey. On the way, the caravan he was travelling with was attacked by a group of robbers. The robbers began searching everyone's belongings and taking away whatever valuables they could find.\n\nOne of the robbers came to him and asked if he had anything valuable. Calmly, the young Abdul Quadir replied, \"Yes, I have forty gold coins sewn inside my clothes.\" The robber was surprised by his honesty and took him to the leader of the gang.\n\nThe leader asked, \"Why did you tell the truth when you knew we would take your money?\" The boy replied, \"Before leaving home, I promised my mother I would never tell a lie. I fear breaking her trust more than I fear losing my wealth.\"\n\nHearing this, the leader was deeply moved. Tears filled his eyes as he said, \"You fear your mother's words, but we do not fear the words of our Creator.\" He immediately repented for his sins and decided to give up his life of crime.\n\nHis fellow robbers also followed him, and the entire gang turned over a new leaf. Thus, the honesty of a young boy not only saved his own life but also changed the lives of many others.\n\nFrom that day, Hazrat Abdul Quadir Zilani (R.) became an example of truthfulness and righteousness for people all over the world.\n"

          "explanation": "The bar chart deals with the number of people living below the poverty line in the years of 1995, 2004, 2008 and 2010. In the bar chart, the percentage of the number of people living below the poverty line is compared among four years. 35.6 percent people were living under the poverty line in 1995. Nine years later, in 2004, the number rose to 45 percent which is about 9.4 percent higher than 1995 . In 2008, fortunately the number decreased to 36.3 percent which is about 8.7 percent lower than that of four years ago. Finally, in 2010 , with a happy note the number decreased to 31.51 percent which is about 4.79 percent lower than that of 2008. So, it can be said that within the time span of 15 years the percentage of the people living below the poverty line has slightly been decreased. Though in 2008 the number rose, in the following years it decreased gradually."

Or, what's going on in our neighbouring countries?\n\nFahim : Really not.\n\nNadim : But I know, because I read newspapers regularly. Newspapers can provide you with the news of the home and abroad. It's especially important for the students as it's the best medium of enriching our general knowledge. For this, it's called the storehouse of knowledge.\n\nFahim : You're right.\n\nNadim : Newspaper can make you introduce to the culture and customs of different countries of the world.

That’s actually a great topic. I think it’s a bit of both. Mobile phones are super helpful for staying connected and accessing information, but they also have their downsides.\nNoha: Totally agree. Like, one of the biggest merits is easy communication. We can call, text, or video chat with friends and family anytime.\nMahin: Yeah, and educational apps and online resources make studying easier too. We can watch tutorials, join online classes, and even do research quickly.\nNoha: Right. But on the flip side, many teens get addicted to social media and games. That really affects their studies and sleep.\nMahin: Exactly. And some even suffer from anxiety or low self-esteem because of comparing themselves to others on social media.\nNoha: Another issue is less face-to-face interaction. I feel like teens are losing social skills because they’re always on their phones.\nMahin: True. Plus, spending too much time staring at screens can cause eye problems and other health issues.\nNoha: But still, if we use mobile phones responsibly, they can be very useful. It’s all about balance, right?\nMahin: Definitely. Using phones wisely can make teenage life easier and more productive, but overuse can lead to serious problems.\nNoha: Well said, Mahin. I think every teen should know both sides before using a phone too much.\nMahin: For sure. Awareness is the first step to using technology in a healthy way"

How much would you love it if you were placed in a store full of flowers the whole day? I'm just going to give you some clues about such a job which can also be a business. Yes. Daisies, violets, tulips, marigolds, dahlias, lilies, jasmines, roses and all those things of beauty can also earn you a living if you handle them professionally. If you start such a profession you will be called a florist. A florist's career is a good choice as an unconventional job for many around the world. Wherever you see eye-catching floral displays, you actually see the professional performance of a floral designer. Using both real and artificial flowers with other greeneries. florists prepare flower displays for a variety of a events such as weddings, birthdays, anniversaries, valentine's day, official receptions and even funerals. Every flower comes with its distinct colour design, value and meaning which flower designers have to know well. There are conventions and meanings associated with flowers. We know that conventionally roses are meant for romance and marriage anniversaries and tulips for birthdays.\nAlthough formal education or a diploma is not always essential for florists, they must have good taste, a good eye for colours, shapes and proportion. They have to have good sense for selecting flowers, ribbons and other accessories to make beautiful arrangements. Professional florists are knowledgeable about not only flowers but also designs and techniques. Most florists learn the trade mainly through apprenticeship in a previous flower farming job and also attending formal schools and courses. However, a true passion for flowers and a bit of aesthetic senses are all that can make a florist a career successful.\nFlower designers earn fairly handsome money. But the bonus is that they work in a fresh and beautiful environment which their clients also enjoy. They work with flowers all day long in a pleasant and fragrant atmosphere with vivid colours around. But there is a disadvantage too, if you are inclined to see so. Florists deal with flowers, but miss their honey!",
