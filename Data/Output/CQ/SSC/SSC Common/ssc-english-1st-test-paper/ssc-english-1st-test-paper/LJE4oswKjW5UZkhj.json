          "explanation": "(a) The sense of obligation to his village motivated Mr Islam to remain in that place instead of pursuing a career in the city. He wanted to work as a farmer, live with his family, and be close to his roots.\n(b) To Mr Islam and his brothers, the purpose of education is not only to pursue office jobs but also to contribute to their community. Despite being highly educated, the Islam brothers did not run after a conventional career like most people. Instead, they remained in their village and chose work that aligned with their academic background.\n(c) Mr Islam finds contentment in his village life through simple yet meaningful activities such as working on his own farm, resting in his own house, spending time with his family and reconnecting with old friends.\n(d) It can be inferred that education helped Islam brothers understand the significance of one's obligation towards his/her community. Realizing this obligation, they contributed actively to their community from their respective fields.\n(e) The Islam brothers convey an inspiring message about the relationship between one's roots and professional aspirations. They believe that the role of education goes beyond personal gain and it should also serve the community. As sons and daughters of the soil, it is our responsibility to utilize our learnings for the betterment of our roots.\n"

When we speak of 'World Heritage', it indicates places and sites that we. inherited from the past and pass on to the future generation of the entire world.\nThe 'Shat Gambuj Mosque' in Bagerhat is such a heritage. It became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985. Originally, the historic Mosque City was known as 'Khalifatabad'.

          "explanation": "Early Rising\n\nEarly rising is a positive habit. It means that we should get up from bed early in the morning to enable ourselves to be ready for a new day. This fact, when made into a regular habit, will surely lead us to a world of bliss and prosperity. A proverb says, \"Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.\" Early rising has many benefits. The man who rises early in the morning can take some exercises or a walk in the fresh air by the riverside or in the open field. It makes our minds fresh and lively. Early in the morning, nature seems quiet and calm. No hue and cry are heard then. Nature smiles in the morning with colourful flowers and green leaves. Birds begin to chirp. These beautiful gifts and colourful nature in the morning remind everybody of the Creator. One feels like praying to the Almighty: But it is not easy to attain this quality. Sleeping late at night does not help in early rising. So, to rise early from bed, we have to go to bed early. An early riser enjoys the surroundings very much and gets enough time to do his work either in study or in other work, which will bring him success. On the contrary, if one gets up late, the schedule of his work becomes interrupted. Above all, early rising keeps us healthy and cheerful. For all these reasons, we all should cultivate the habit of early rising."

The boy was working in a workshop. His body was covered with dirt, oil and other chemicals. Talha became curious about the boy. He asked the boy his name and learnt that people called him 'Falu'. He got even more curious. Going closer, he asked the boy what might be the reason that people gave him such a strange name. Falu said that he was left at the roadside just after his birth. He didn't know who his parents were. He used to beg at the town even to get something to eat. He had nowhere to go; none were there to support him. Finally, while begging at a bus stop, he met Kashem Ali, the owner of the workshop. That night Falu was starving, and was crying helplessly. At that miserable hour, God sent Kashem Ali in his aid. Kashem was a compassionate man and Falu's extreme miseries moved him much. He offered Falu a job at his workshop. And now, Falu was thankful to have a shelter and food to eat. Kashem Ali told him that he could start school from. next year. Falu looked dreamy; he was thinking about a better future. Talha, on the other hand, being greatly moved by the touching story of Falu's life, thanked God for all the privileges bestowed on him. Life is after all an adventure!"

          "explanation": "\nThe graph projects the gradual rise in the number of Facebook users based on their gender orientation in a city named 'T' from 2015 to 2019. In 2015, only 50,000 males used Facebook, while female subscribers were significantly fewer in number, only 25,000. The next year, the numbers of both male and female users rose to 75,000 and 50,000, respectively. The number of male users increased rapidly in the following years. By 2017, it rose to 170,000; 160,000 in 2018; and 230,000 in 2019. The number of female users skyrocketed in the subsequent years: 75,000 in 2017; 130,000 in 2018; and 200,000 in 2019. The data shows that despite a rapid rise, the number of female Facebook users was still less than that of male Facebook users. Apart from providing a comparative picture of male and female Facebook users, the graph also gives an overall idea of the drastic change in the attitude of common people towards Facebook."
