          "explanation": "Tree Plantation\nTree plantation means planting trees on a large scale in a planned way. Trees are our friends. They give us shade and soothe our eyes with their green colour. They give us various kinds of fruits. They give us firewood as fuel for cooking. They give us timber for furniture, doors and windows, boats, electric poles, railway slippers, etc. They give us rubber too. Trees take in carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. Sufficient trees cause sufficient rainfall and prevent draught. Trees along the roadside and coastal areas preyent erosion and tidal bore. But many inconsiderate pcople are cutting down trees for their selfish interests. So, we are losing trees. If there is no tree, there will be no civilization. In fact, the loss of trees will take our existence to the verge of extinction. The earth will be no more habitable. Hence, tree plantation must be taken as a project. The more we plant trees, the morė our environment will be balanced and greener. In Bangladesh, tree plantation is compulsory because we do not have as much forest as we require to maintain the ecological balance. There is no specific time to plant trees. We can plant trees any time of the year based on the type of the trees. Park, yard, urban areas, open field, balcony, rooftops; roadside places, etc. are best places to plant trees. To make life peaceful, there is no alternative to tree plantation."

          "explanation": "Adib's Realization\nAdib is a brilliant student. Though he wants to make good result, he does not attend classes regularly. Rather going to a coaching center, he memorizes answers from guide books and sheets and finds that he cannot cut a good figure in the exams. One day, his class teacher called him and asked why he depended on guidebooks and memorized answers without understanding anything. Adib replied, \"I have been doing that since childhood. Both of my parents are illiterate, so they can't help me with my studies. In the coaching center, the teachers only provide sheets and ask us to memorize the answers.\" Hearing this, the teacher became very disappointed. He said to Adib, \"Listen, Adib! Ours is a creative curriculum. In this system of education, memorization will never help you. You must read and understand your textbooks thoroughly. Then you will be able to answer the creative questions. I know you're a brilliant student and capable of handling the creative curriculum.\" Adib understood his mistake and promised his class teacher that he would no longer depend on coaching centers, guidebooks, and sheets. He said, \"From now on, I will be regular and attentive in class and take notes during lectures.\" His teacher became happy and said, \"That's very good. If you need any help, don't hesitate to come to me.\""

          "explanation": "The pie chart shows the subject preferences of students in a secondary school. It highlights their interest in four key subjects: Mathematics, Science, Bangla, and English. According to the chart, Mathematics is the most preferred subject, with 35% of the students showing interest in it. This is followed by Science, which attracts 25% of the students. Bangla is also popular, drawing the attention of 23% of the students. English, however, is the least chosen subject, with only 17% showing interest in it.\nFrom the data, it is clear that students tend to favor subjects related to logic and reasoning, such as Mathematics and Science, over languages. This could be due to the growing importance of science and technology in modern education and career paths. Nonetheless, the significant interest in Bangla reflects a continued appreciation for the mother tongue. Overall, the chart shows a balanced but slightly science-leaning academic interest among students."

I feel like I should learn computers, but I don’t really know where to start. I have little knowledge about it.\n\nZahir: I’m glad you’re thinking about it. You’re absolutely right – learning computers is really important these days. It’s used in almost every field, whether it’s for education, work, or even entertainment.\n\nAdil: I agree, but I’m not sure why it’s so essential. Can you explain it to me?\n\nZahir: Of course! First of all, computers are used in almost every job now. Whether it’s business, healthcare, engineering, or even arts, having basic computer skills is necessary. It makes tasks much easier and faster.\n\nAdil: I see. So, what kind of things can I do with computers?\n\nZahir: There are so many things!

Almost every field uses computers now, and having those skills will open up many career opportunities. Plus, it's a great way to stay connected with the world.\n\nAdil: Thanks for the advice, Zahir.

She founded the home for the dying destitute and named `it 'Nirmal Hriday', meaning 'Pure Heart'. She and her fellow nuns brought the dying people offthe streets of Kolkata to this home. They were lovingly looked after and cared for. Since then many men, women and children have been taken from the streets and carried to Nirmal Hriday. These unloved and uncared for people get an opportunity to die in an environment of kindness and love. In their last hours, they get human and divine love, and can feel they are also children of God. The Missionaries of Charity try to find jobs for those who survive, or send them to homes where they can live happily for some more years in a caring environment. Regarding commitment to family, Mother Teresa said, \"May be in our own family, we have somebody, who is feeling lonely,. who is feeling sick, who is feeling worried. Are we there? Are we willing to give until it hurts in order to be with our families, or do we put our interest first? We must remember that love begins at home and we must also remember that future of humanity passes through the family.\" & Mother Teresa's work has been recognised throughout the world and she received a number of awards. These include the Pope John XXIII Peace Prize (1971), the Nehru Prize for Promotion of International Peace Understanding (1972), the Balzan Prize (1978), the Nobel Peace Prize (1979) and the Bharat Ratna (1980). Mother Teresa died at the age of 87, on 5 September 1997. The world salutes her for her love and compassion for humanity. She has taught us how to extend our hand towards those who need our love and support irrespective of creed, caste and religion. The picture of Mother Teresa, draped in a white and blue-bordered sari, with a wrinkled face, ever soft eyes and a saintly smile, lives on in our mind.\nChoose the best answer from the alternatives:",
