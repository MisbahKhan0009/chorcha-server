But they can control the increase in the amount of greenhouse gases and its effect on the atmosphere. Only during the last hundred years the carbon dioxide concentration has been raised alarmingly in the atmosphere and we humans can be held responsible for this. The main cause of the increase in carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels. Since the end of the 19 th century, industrial activities increased rapidly giving rise to many factories. These factories required energy, which was produced through the combustion of coal. Besides coal, other sources of energy such as mineral oil and natural gas were also burned to heat our houses, run cars and airplanes or to produce electricity. Nowadays, about 85 million barrels of crude oil are burned daily. Every time a fossil raw material is burned, it releases carbon dioxide into the air.\nTherefore, it is clear that more and more greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide are being generated worldwide by humans. Moreover, we are also strengthening the greenhouse effect by deforestation, which means cutting down trees. Every year enormous areas of forests are destroyed by people to obtain wood and to clear regions for mining and to create pasture. This loss of the forest causes dual problems. Trees that are burned up release large volumes of carbon dioxide gas into the air. On the other hand, as forests absorb a lot of carbon dioxide from the air and deliver oxygen instead, we also destroy an important storehouse of carbon dioxide when we clear forests.\nChoose the correct answer from the following alternatives.",

          "explanation": "The Choice That Matters\n\n\nOn the morning of his final exam, Arif found an old, dust-covered envelope slipped under his dorm room door. His name was written in elegant handwriting he didn't recognize, and the paper smelled faintly of jasmine and ink. Though he was running late, something about the letter made him pause, torn between curiosity and duty. So, without any delay he opened the letter instantly and read: \"The true test lies not in the exam you are about to take, but in the choice you will make today.\" Arif got confused but intrigued. He decided to take the test in calm mind first. So, he kept the letter in his pocket and hurried to the exam hall. The entire time, his mind was consumed with the strange message. As he sat down to take the exam, he answered the questions one by one properly. Hе found himself staring at the clock, torn between finishing the test and seeking the meaning behind the letter. After the exam, he rushed to the place mentioned in the letter. There, he found a quit, elderly man sitting on a bench. The man smiled and gestured for Arif to sit beside him. \"I see you've made it,\" the man said, his voice warm. \"You've passed the true test; the ability to pause and reflect before rushing forward.\" Arif was confused. \"What do you mean? I've just taken my final exam.\" The man smiled again: \"The world is filled with distractions. The true path to success lies in choosing wisely when faced with decisions. You've learned that today.\" Arif understood then. The real test wasn't the exam, but how he made the right choice at the right time. Sometimes, the most important choice we make is to simply think before acting."

          "explanation": "Ruma: Hi Shumi, have you noticed how almost every job advertisement nowadays mentions computer skills as a requirement?\nShumi: Yes, Ruma. It seems like no matter what field we choose, technology is involved.\nRuma: Exactly. Even traditional jobs now demand basic knowledge of computers, like using spreadsheets, emails, or online platforms.\nShumi: True. And modérn technology like artificial intelligence, data analysis, and digital marketing are creating new opportunities too.\nRuma: That's why I think learning computer skills isn't just optional anymore; rather it's essential for preparing ourselves for future employment.\nShumi: I agree. Without these skills, we might struggle to compete in the job market.\nRuma: Even employers expect us to use new apps and tools efficiently.\nShumi: Right. I've also noticed it.\nRuma: Actually, technology makes us more efficient. For example, a task that takes hours manually can be done in minutes with the right software.\nShumi: So, we should start improving our skills now. We can join online courses or practice regularly. Ruma: Absolutely. If we invest time in learning, we'll be more confident and ready for any career challenges ahead.\nShumi: Well said, Ruma. Let's make it a goal to strengthen our computer and tech skills."
