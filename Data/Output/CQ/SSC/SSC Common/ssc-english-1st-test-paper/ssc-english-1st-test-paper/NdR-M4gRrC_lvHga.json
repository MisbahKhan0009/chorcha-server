          "explanation": "a. February 21 is a memorable day in our national history because on this day in 1952, the heroic son's of Bengal laid down their lives to establish Bangla as a state language of the undivided Pakistan. On this day, we pay tribute to the language martyrs because of their sacrifice for the rightful place of mother tongue.\nb. The then Governor General of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Zinnah, is responsible to raise a storm of protest. In a public meeting in Dhaka, he declared Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan, which disregarded the language rights of the Bangalee. Therefore, a mass protest started across the country.\nc. The Pakistani government banned all sorts of public meetings and gatherings to stop the protest that began following Mohammad Ali Jinnah's declaration of Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan and continued non-stop.\nd. Against the declaration of outlawing all sorts of public meeting and rallies, the students of Dhaka University brought out a peaceful protest procession on 21 February, defying the law.\ne. The Language Movement of 1952 kindled the sparks of independence movement in East Pakistan by making the Bangalees aware of their rights. Thus, the Language Movement is related to the independence movement of Bangladesh."

A school library is only for the teachers and the students of a school. We have an up-to-date library in our school. It is housed in a separate one-storey building. It is quite spacious and well-ventilated. The books are arranged systemically in different bookshelves. So, we have no difficulty in finding out the expected books. Our school library has a good collection of text and reference books. It has also books on different branches of knowledge like literature, history, science, commerce, geography, travels, biography and so on. Besides, it has a good supply of newspapers, magazines and journals. Moreover, there is a librarian in charge of our school library. He is well-trained, qualified and experienced. Every student has a library card. We can borrow two books at a time. Nobody is allowed to keep a book for more than two weeks. In the library; discipline and silence is strictly maintained. While studying in the reading room, students are strictly prohibited to talk or disturb others in any way. The calm and quiet atmosphere of the library helps the students to work attentively. Our school library plays an important role in enriching both our academic and general knowledge. It provides us with the opportunity to read different types of books. To us, it is a storehouse of knowledge. I think, every educational institution should have a library. To conclude it can be said that no educational institute is a complete one without a library.\n"

Being defeated for six times, he lost his hope. Getting disappointed, he took shelter in a remote cave. Once, he was lying in the cave. Then he saw a spider trying hard to reach the ceiling of the cave. The spider failed again and again to succeed. But he did not give up hope. Bruce saw the spider climbing to the ceiling 'after some unsuccessful attempts. This dauntless spider inspired Bruce to shake off the darkness of despair. He gathered an army of strong men and attacked his enemies. The enemies courted defeat and Bruce regained his kingdom. It taught us that; 'perseverance is the key to success'."

          "explanation": "The pie chart shows the subject preferences of students in a secondary school. It highlights their interest in four key subjects: Mathematics, Science, Bangla, and English. According to the chart, Mathematics is the most preferred subject, with 35% of the students showing interest in it. This is followed by Science, which attracts 25% of the students. Bangla is also popular, drawing the attention of 23% of the students. English, however, is the least chosen subject, with only 17% showing interest in it.\nFrom the data, it is clear that students tend to favor subjects related to logic and reasoning, such as Mathematics and Science, over languages. This could be due to the growing importance of science and technology in modern education and career paths. Nonetheless, the significant interest in Bangla reflects a continued appreciation for the mother tongue. Overall, the chart shows a balanced but slightly science-leaning academic interest among students."

For this, it's called the storehouse of knowledge.\n\nFahim : You're right.\n\nNadim : Newspaper can make you introduce to the culture and customs of different countries of the world. You can know some such important information which are applicable to your practical life.\n\nFahim : You've opened my eyes. Now, I can feel the necessity of reading newspapers.
