Then answer the questions below:\n\"Art should comfort the disturbed and disturb the uncomfortable,\" writes the pseudonymous street artist Bansky-a sentiment that encapsulates the spirit of graffiti's defiance. On July 17, 2024, Abu Sayeed, an unarmed organizer of the students' movement for quota reform at Begum Rokeya University in Rangpur, was shot and killed by police as he stood with his arms stretched out, leaving his mother, Monowara Begum, shell-shocked and crying, \"My son only wanted a job; if you don't want to give him a job, then don't - but why did you kill him?\"\nSince the 1960's, graffiti in Bangladesh has served as a powerful voice for resistance. In 1966, student activists spray-painted slogans like \"Down with Ayub Khan\" on walls, using graffiti as a covert means of protest against a repressive regime. When military forces approached, they shouted \"chika! chika!\" - a word meaning mole or muskrat - pretending they were killing rodent to disguise their actions, This guerrilla tactic marked the beginning of graffiti as a tool of dissent in Bangladesh, and it played a crucial role in the liberation war in 1971.\nNoor Hossain, with the words \"Down with Autocracy\" স্বৈরাচার নীপাত যাক; however, the Bangla spelling for নীপাত is নিপাত the misspelling underscoring ray spontaneity of such expressions boldly paínted in bright white on his bare chest, was photographed by Dinu Alam on November 10, 1987, during a pro-democracy protest in Dhaka. Shortly after, he was shot and killed by Bangladesh Police.\nChoose the correct answer from the following alternatives.",

          "explanation": "A Chance beyond Expectations\n\nShreyas, a teenaged boy, became dumbfounded when he got to hear the news that his school had suddenly announced a scholarship exam for higher studies abroad. He had always dreamed of studying in a reputed university, but he never thought such a chance would come so soon. At first, Shreyas felt nervous because the competition was tough and only a few students would be selected. His parents encouraged him, reminding him of his hard work and dedication. Shreyas immediately made a study plan and reduced his hours of playing video games. His friends teased him for being too serious, but Shreyas stayed focused. Day by day, his confidence grew as he solved practice papers and revised important topics. On the day of the exam, he felt anxious but remembered his parents' words: \"Do your best, success will follow.\" The exam was challenging, yet Shreyas remained calm and answered carefully. After finishing, he felt relieved, knowing he had given his best effort. Weeks later, the result was announced, and Shreyas was among the top scorers. His joy knew no bounds, and his parents were proud of his achievement. The scholarship opened doors to a brighter future. It proved that determination can change destiny. Shreyas realized that opportunities come unexpectedly, but.preparation and hard work make them meaningful. From that day, he promised himself never to doubt his abilities again."
