He is renowned for his Gettysburg Address, delivered during the American Civil War on November 19, 1863. Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809 in Kentucky, USA. His parents hailed from Virginia.

Lincoln famously issued the Emancipation Proclamation, declaring a ban on slavery in America on January 1, 1863. He was re-elected in 1864.

          "explanation": "A Street Hawkar\n\nA street hawker is a common sight in bustling towns and cities. He is a hardworking individual who earns his livelihood by selling goods on the streets. With a basket balanced on his head, a cart, or a portable stall, he roams from one neighborhood to another, calling out his wares in a loud, melodic voice to attract customers. Street hawkers often sell a variety of items, including fruits, vegetables, toys, snacks, or household goods. Their offerings vary with the time of day and the season, catering to the changing needs of the public.\nThe life of a street hawker is not easy. They face long hours under the scorching sun, unpredictable weather, and the constant challenge of competing with others for customers. Despite this, they often exude cheerfulness, as their survival depends on building relationships with their patrons. Hawkers bring convenience to people’s doorsteps, especially for those who cannot visit markets.\nHowever, their presence can sometimes cause congestion and noise in busy areas. Nonetheless, they play an essential role in the local economy, offering affordable goods to people from all walks of life. A street hawker embodies resilience, adaptability, and the entrepreneurial spirit that thrives in urban life."

At last, he saw a jar. He peeped into the jar and saw that there was a little water at the bottom of the jar. He tried to drink water but his bill could not reach it. He tried again and again but in vain. He became very sad and hopeless. Suddenly, he saw some small pieces of stone near the jar. A good idea came into his head. He picked up the stones and dropped them into the jar one by one. As a result, the water came up to the brim. The crow then drank water from it to his heart's content and flew away with a joyful mind."
