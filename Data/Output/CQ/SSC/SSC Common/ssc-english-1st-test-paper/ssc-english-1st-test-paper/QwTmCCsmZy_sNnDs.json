An atoll is a ring-shaped coral reef or a string of closely spaced coral islands. The natural coral reefs of the Maldives are surrounded by the sea all around and stand out as a pearl in the Indian Ocean. The Maldives is the eighth smallest country in the world with an area of only 300 square kilometers. It is the smallest Asian country in terms of population and size.\nPeople have been living on the islands of the Maldives for nearly 3000 years. They set sail from different parts ofthe world - Asia, Arabia, Europe and America - to come to these islands. The earliest settlers of the Maldives were probably from southern India and Sri Lanka who came to these islands in the fourth and fifth' centuries BC. In the 12th century AD, sailors from East Africa and Arab countries came to the Maldives. As a result, the Maldivians who were originally Buddhists were converted to Sunni Islam in the mid-12th century. In 1344 Ibn Batuta, a famous Arab historian and scholar travelled around the Maldives.\nIn the 16th century, the Portuguese conquered the Maldives and ruled the country for 15 years. Although governed as an independent Islamic sultanate for most of its history from 1153 to 1968, the Maldives was a British colony from 1887 to 1965. Following independence from Britain in 1965, the sultanate continued to operate for another 3 ·years. On November 11, 1968, the sultanate was abolished and replaced by a republic and the country assumed its present name.\nChoose the correct answer from the alternatives.",

The hare always teased the tortoise for its slow speed. One day, the hare was walking. Suddenly, he saw the tortoise. It was moving very slowly. He laughed at it saying, \"Hurry up, you are so slow! Can't you move a little faster?\" The tortoise felt angry and said, \"Why don't we run a race and see who wins?\" The hare laughed even more loudly and said, \"Why not? Let's do that.\" The next morning, they started their race. The hare ran so fast that the tortoise remained far behind. He looked back, but there was no trace of the tortoise. The hare was sure of his victory, and hence, he sat under a tree to take rest, but unfortunately he fell asleep. On the other hand, the tortoise ran slowly but steadily, and in a'short time, it passed by the sleeping hare. When the hare woke up, he looked around and saw in surprise that the tortoise was near the finishing line. He ran as fast as he could, but it was too late. After that, the tortoise had reached the finishing line. The tortoise looked back at the hare and said smilingly, \"See how the slow but steady wins the race!\""

Moreover, people who are not interested to send their children to school should be motivated to and made aware of the necessity of education.\n\nRumon: Is it possible for government only?\nMunir: The literate people will also help the government.\n\nRumon: I also think so. But our country is poor. What will the poor section do?\nMunir: In this case, food for education programme should be commenced and the poor should be encouraged to come to school.\n\nRumon: We can also help them.
