          "question": "",
          "explanation": "(a) Humans can neither change the sun's radiation nor the earth's orbit around the sun, because these things are beyond their control.\n\n(b) Human beings do some unwise activities like burning too much fossil fuels, setting up more factories, cutting down trees indiscriminately, etc. that result in the increase of greenhouse gases. Thus, they are responsible for the increase in the greenhouse gases.\n\n(c) I think the main cause of the increase in carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels. With the increase of industrial activities, the combustion of coal has increased. Besides coal, mineral oil and natural gas are also burned for various purposes. Thus, every time a fossil raw material is burned, it releases carbon dioxide into the air.\n\n(d) Enormous areas of forests are destroyed by the people every year to obtain wood and to clear regions for mining and to create pasture."

      "uddipok": "It was late summer, 26 August 1910. A little girl was born to a rich Catholic merchants' family of Albanian descent in a small town called Skopje, Macedonia. She was the youngest of the three siblings and was named Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu. Who could imagine at the time that this little girl would one day become the mother of humanity, loving and serving the poorest of the poor. Yes, we are talking about none other than Mother Teresa.\n\nAt the age of 12, she heard a voice from within that urged her to spread the love of Christ. She decided that she would be a missionary. At the age of 18 , she left her parental home. She then joined an Irish community of nuns called the Sisters of Loreto, which had missions in India.\n\nAfter a few months of training at the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Dublin, Mother Teresa came to India. On May 24, 1931, she took her initial vows as a nun. From 1931 to 1948, Mother Teresa taught geography and theology at St. Mary's High School in Kolkata (then Calcutta). However, the widespread poverty in Kolkata had a deep impact on Mother Teresa and in 1948, she received permission from her superiors to leave the convent and devote herself to caring for the poorest of the poor in the slums of Kolkata.\n\nFor the contribution to humanity, she was awarded the Noble Peace Prize in 1979. She died at the age of 87 , on 5 September, 1997.\nWrite a summary of the above passage in your own words.",

Or, what's going on in our neighbouring countries?\n\nFahim : Really not.\n\nNadim : But I know, because I read newspapers regularly. Newspapers can provide you with the news of the home and abroad. It's especially important for the students as it's the best medium of enriching our general knowledge. For this, it's called the storehouse of knowledge.\n\nFahim : You're right.\n\nNadim : Newspaper can make you introduce to the culture and customs of different countries of the world. You can know some such important information which are applicable to your practical life.\n\nFahim : You've opened my eyes. Now, I can feel the necessity of reading newspapers. Really, I'm detached from the current world. But I promise, I'll build up the\nhabit of reading newspaper from today. Thank you very much.\n\nNadim : You're most welcome."

Trust me, waking up early makes you feel more energetic and focused. Plus, you can enjoy the peaceful morning atmosphere.\nTalha: Hmm, that actually sounds nice. Do you wake up early every day?\nShakir: I try to. I go for a short walk, enjoy the fresh air, and it really helps me concentrate better in class.\nTalha: Alright, I’ll give it a try. Maybe I’ll set an alarm for 6 AM tomorrow!\nShakir: That’s the spirit! Start with small steps. You’ll notice the change soon."
