          "question": "",
          "explanation": "(a) Humans can neither change the sun's radiation nor the earth's orbit around the sun, because these things are beyond their control.\n\n(b) Human beings do some unwise activities like burning too much fossil fuels, setting up more factories, cutting down trees indiscriminately, etc. that result in the increase of greenhouse gases. Thus, they are responsible for the increase in the greenhouse gases.\n\n(c) I think the main cause of the increase in carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels. With the increase of industrial activities, the combustion of coal has increased. Besides coal, mineral oil and natural gas are also burned for various purposes. Thus, every time a fossil raw material is burned, it releases carbon dioxide into the air.\n\n(d) Enormous areas of forests are destroyed by the people every year to obtain wood and to clear regions for mining and to create pasture."

With a land area of 18,386 hectares, it supports a rich biodiversity and provides direct and indirect livelihood benefits to nearly 1 , 90 , 000 1,90,000 1 , 90 , 000 people. This haor was declared an Ecologically Critical Area in April 1999 by the government of Bangladesh. Hakaluki is a complex ecosystem, containing more than 238 interconnecting beels and jalmahals. The haor falls under two administrative districts, Maulvibazar and Sylhet. Some 1,90,000 people live in the area surrounding the haor. The haor is a very important resting place for migratory waterfowls flying in from the north, the most interesting species is the Barheaded Goose, which is now hardly seen in fresh water wetlands. Many other important species of waterfowls make the haor their temporary home. Unfortunately, illegal poaching has been a threat to the waterfowl population in this vast wetland. Hakaluki haor is known as a good grazing land in winter. People from villages around the haor and also from distant areas send their herds for grazing. During this time, herders make temporary shelters near the beels and graze their animals for a period of 4 to 5 months. The haor had very dense swamp forests in the past, but deforestation and lack of conservation practices have virtually destroyed this unique forest in the last two decades.\n\nWrite a summary of the above passage, in your own words.",

          "explanation": "A Thirsty Crow\nOne day, a crow became very thirsty. He flew from place to place in search of water. But he found no water. He continued his search for water. At last, he saw a jar. He peeped into the jar and saw that there was a little water at the bottom of the jar. He tried to drink water but his bill could not reach it. He tried again and again but in vain. He became very sad and hopeless. Suddenly, he saw some small pieces of stone near the jar. A good idea came into his head. He picked up the stones and dropped them into the jar one by one. As a result, the water came up to the brim. The crow then drank water from it to his heart's content and flew away with a joyful mind."

          "explanation": "Noha: Hey Mahin! I was reading an article yesterday about how mobile phones affect teenagers. It got me thinking—do you think it's more helpful or harmful?\nMahin: Hey Noha! That’s actually a great topic. I think it’s a bit of both. Mobile phones are super helpful for staying connected and accessing information, but they also have their downsides.\nNoha: Totally agree. Like, one of the biggest merits is easy communication. We can call, text, or video chat with friends and family anytime.\nMahin: Yeah, and educational apps and online resources make studying easier too. We can watch tutorials, join online classes, and even do research quickly.\nNoha: Right. But on the flip side, many teens get addicted to social media and games. That really affects their studies and sleep.\nMahin: Exactly. And some even suffer from anxiety or low self-esteem because of comparing themselves to others on social media.\nNoha: Another issue is less face-to-face interaction. I feel like teens are losing social skills because they’re always on their phones.\nMahin: True. Plus, spending too much time staring at screens can cause eye problems and other health issues.\nNoha: But still, if we use mobile phones responsibly, they can be very useful. It’s all about balance, right?\nMahin: Definitely. Using phones wisely can make teenage life easier and more productive, but overuse can lead to serious problems.\nNoha: Well said, Mahin. I think every teen should know both sides before using a phone too much.\nMahin: For sure. Awareness is the first step to using technology in a healthy way"
