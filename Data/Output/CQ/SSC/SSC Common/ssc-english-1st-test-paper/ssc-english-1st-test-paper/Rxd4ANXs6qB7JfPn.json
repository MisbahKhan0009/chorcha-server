The little boy and the mongoose were fond of each other. They were good playmates. One day, the little boy was playing in the yard while the mongoose was resting nearby. Suddenly, a venomous snake slithered out from behind a bush. The snake was very dangerous and was moving towards the boy. The mongoose saw the snake immediately and became alert. It jumped quickly and attacked the snake to protect the boy. The boy screamed loudly, and his mother came running to see what had happened. After a fierce struggle, the mongoose killed the snake. The little boy hugged the mongoose and thanked it for saving his fife. The farmer and his wife were very proud of their brave pet. From that day, the boy and the mongoose became even closer friends. They played together every day, and the parents made sure the mongoose was always safe and loved. The village people heard about the mongoose's bravery and praised it."

I have so many exams and assignments.\nProyash: I understand. It is normal to feel stressed sometimes, but we must take care of our mental health too.\nFarabi: Yes, but I don't know how to manage it.\nProyash: Well, first you can make a proper schedule. Divide your study time and rest time. Don't study continuously for hours.\nFarabi: That sounds good. What else can I do?\nProyash: You should also take short breaks, do some exercise, and spend time with friends or family. Talking to someone you trust can help reduce stress.\nFarabi: Hmm... I rarely do exercises. Maybe that is why I feel tired and worried.\nProyash: Yes, physical activity helps the mind too. You can also practice deep breathing or meditation to stay calm.\nFarabi: Thank you, Proyash. I will try these tips. I hope I feel better soon.\nProyash: You will, Farabi. Remember, taking care of your mental health is as important as studying,"
