But they can control the increase in the amount of greenhouse gases and its effect on the atmosphere. Only during the last hundred years the carbon dioxide concentration has been raised alarmingly in the atmosphere and we humans can be held responsible for this. The main cause of the increase in carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels. Since the end of the 19th century, industrial activities increased rapidly giving rise to many factories. These factories required energy, which was produced through the combustion of coal. Besides coal, other sources of energy such as mineral oil and natural gas were also burned to heat our houses, run cars and airplanes or to produce electricity. Nowadays, about 85 million barrels of crude oil are burned daily. Every time a fossil raw material is burned, it releases carbon dioxide into the air. Therefore, it is clear that more and more greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide are being generated worldwide by humans. Moreover, we are also strengthening the greenhouse effect by deforestation, which means cutting down trees. Every year enormous areas of forests are destroyed by people to obtain wood and to clear regions for mining and to create pasture. This loss of the forest causes dual problems. Trees that are burned up release large volumes of carbon dioxide gas into the air. On the other hand, as forests absorb a lot of carbon dioxide from the air and deliver oxygen instead, we also destroy an important storehouse of carbon dioxide when we clear forests.\nChoose the correct answer from the alternatives.",

But he had to leave his beautiful bushy tail behind him. For a long time, he kept away from the other foxes. Without the tail, he looked strange, and so he felt sad. But the fox was very cunning. He hit upon a plan. He invited all the foxes to come to a meeting. All the foxes of the jungle attended the meeting. The fox felt his importance when he saw all other foxes in his meeting. He said, \"My dear friends, listen to me, please. I've discovered something new; the tails of ours are useless. They look ugly and are always dirty. So, we should cut off our tails.\" All the foxes listened to the cunning fox. A wise old fox was also listening. He said, \"My friend, your plan is very interesting but foolish. As you've lost your tail, you want us to cut off our tails:\"At this, the fox without a tail felt ashamed and realized that they would not fall prey to his trap. So, he left the place quickly."
