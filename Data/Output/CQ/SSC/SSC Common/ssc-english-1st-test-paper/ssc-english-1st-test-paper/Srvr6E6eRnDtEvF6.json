          "explanation": "A Rainy Day\nA rainy day is dull and gloomy. Sometimes, it drizzles and sometimes, it rains heavily all day long. The sky remains overcast with black clouds. The sun is hardly visible. Gusty wind blows from all sides. Birds keep standing on branches of trees or keep quiet in their nests. Cattle remain in their sheds and bellow for the fodder. Water stands here and there. Unpitched roads become muddy and slippery. Passers-by have to walk with umbrella over their head, shoes in hand and pants folded up to the knee. Sometimes people slip and fall on the muddy road. In cities, a rainy day is now a horror. The roads and streets in some towns and cities get flooded. Vehicles are seen stranding in knee-deep water in some areas due to water clogging. It causes gridlock across the city. It is a day of trouble and annoyance to the office-going people. They have to suffer from yarious inconveniences. But for the school going children, it is a delight to have a rainy day. If it rains heavily before their school time, they get a holiday. Sometimes, children, especially the boys play football in the rainwater in the nearby fields. A rainy day is a curse for the poor. The day labourers cannot go out for work and hence, they have to suffer a lot. However, I pass the day by listening to music, watching TV or reading journals. In short, a rainy day is a day of both pleasure and pain."

In your last letter you wanted to know about the co-curricular activities in my school.\nYou know that I am lucky to study in such a big and famous school which offers us facilities to learn a lot of things besides studies. We can depend on our teachers not only for study matters but also for matters related to our interests. Some of them run different clubs in school. The clubs are places where one can go and pursue his or her hobby. I'm a member of the debating club. We practise debating within the club and arrange debating competitions among different classes and among other schools as well. Our English teacher who runs this club, not only guides us in writing good speeches but also shows us how to present them. 'Our school arranges essay competitions and book reading competitions. Moreover, my school offers a wide range of extra-curricular activities for the students. The school has a musical group and a lot of dramas are played by the students. Besides, the students enjoy hockey and football as extra-curricular activities. Teachers consult with the students at personal level and encourage them to work more and more. The students of this school learn not only for examinations but also for life. In short, I can tell you studying in this school is a great experience. Along with the regular study, we can develop our extracurricular abilities as well.\nI guess, you are planning to shift to a new school. If you ask for suggestion from me, I'll recommend my school without any hesitation.\n\nWith best wishes\nMonir\n"

What're the things of city life you dislike?\nSitu : I think, life in the city is very artificial. People lead a very busy life there. They get up in the morning hearing the noises of motor vehicles, machines and factories.\nRitu : You're right. But there are many modern facilities that you can have only in cities. Good educational institutes, hospitals and clinics are mainly available in the city. Again, there are many spots for recreations.\nSitu: : That's true. But I think life in the village is far better than that of the town. Village life is quite natural. People lead a very simple life. They wake up from sleep hearing the chirping of the birds and can breathe in fresh air: Do you have fresh fish in the town\nRitu : - Actually, fishes are available there, but not fresh.\nSitu : But fresh food, fishes, vegetables, fruits etc. are available in the village, Moreover, village life is pollution free.\nRitu : You're right. But village life is not without its disadvantages. Disease, hunger, malnutrition and poverty are common in the life of the villagers. Also, jobs are not available here.\nSitu : Hmm. Actually, both lives have their advantages and disadvantages. I think a balanced development can remove the gap between these two types of life.\nRitu : Yes. I agree with you. See you later.\nSitu : Ok, bye. Take a good care of yourself."
