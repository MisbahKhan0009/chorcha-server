We can talk to a person thousands of kilometres away on the phone or the Internet. So, we can communicate with the whole world easily. English has made this communication easier.\n\nThere are many countries in the world with many languages, but to communicate with them, you cannot use all the languages. So, you need a common language that you can use with more or less all the people in the world. English is that common language. You can talk to a Chinese toy maker, a French artist, an Arab ambassador or a Korean builder in one language - English.\n\nEnglish for us in Bangladesh is all the more important. As we have seen earlier, we are too many people in a small country. So, if you learn English, you have the best opportunity to find a good job, both within and outside the country. And that is good news for millions of our unemployed youths.\" \"But Miss, we learn English for 12 or 14 years, yet we do not find good jobs\", says Rumi. She then tells the class about what happened to her brother. \"Could you please tell us why?\" Rumi asks. \"This is a very important question, Rumi: We should learn how to use English both orally and in writing for doing things as needed in our work, such as communicating with others at personal, social, national and international levels. But unfortunately, at the moment we are learning English mainly for our exams,\" continues Miss Choudhury. \"Remember, English can greatly help you become skilled workers.\"\n\n\"But where and how can we learn this kind of English, Miss?\" asks Ratan. Ms Choudhury says, \"We can learn English both in ánd outside the classroom. Besides your textbooks, the radio, television, newspapers, magazines, computers and other supplementary materials will greatly help you. During our classroom activities, we'll see how we can learn English.\"\nMatch the parts of the sentences in column A A A , column B B B and column C C C to write four complete sentences.\nColumn A\nColumn B\nColumn C\n(a) Nowadays we can communicate\n(i) to get a good job both inside and outside the country\n(i) and that is English\n(b) But the language\n(ii) with a person living anywhere in the world\n(ii) by learning English\n(c) To communicate with anyone living anywhere\n(iii) is not the same\n(iii) on the phone or the internet\n(d) One can have an opportunity\n(iv) we need a common language\n(iv) in all the countries",

          "explanation": "a. February 21 is a memorable day in our national history because on this day in 1952, the heroic son's of Bengal laid down their lives to establish Bangla as a state language of the undivided Pakistan. On this day, we pay tribute to the language martyrs because of their sacrifice for the rightful place of mother tongue.\nb. The then Governor General of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Zinnah, is responsible to raise a storm of protest. In a public meeting in Dhaka, he declared Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan, which disregarded the language rights of the Bangalee. Therefore, a mass protest started across the country.\nc. The Pakistani government banned all sorts of public meetings and gatherings to stop the protest that began following Mohammad Ali Jinnah's declaration of Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan and continued non-stop.\nd. Against the declaration of outlawing all sorts of public meeting and rallies, the students of Dhaka University brought out a peaceful protest procession on 21 February, defying the law.\ne. The Language Movement of 1952 kindled the sparks of independence movement in East Pakistan by making the Bangalees aware of their rights. Thus, the Language Movement is related to the independence movement of Bangladesh."

      "uddipok": "Mother Teresa was moved by the sight of the sick and dying on the streets of Kolkata. She founded a home for the dying destitute and named it \"Nirmal Hriday\", meaning \"Pure Heart\". She and her fellow nuns gathered the dying people of the streets of Kolkata and brought them to this home. They were lovingly looked after and cared for. Since then men, women and children have been taken from the streets and carried to Nirmal Hriday. These unloved and uncared for people get an opportunity to die in an environment of kindness and love. In their last hours they get human and divine love, and can feel they are also children of God. Those who survive, the Missionaries of Charity try to find jobs for them or send them to homes where they can live happily for some more years in a caring environment. Regarding commitment to family, Mother Teresa said, \"May be in our own family, we have somebody, who is feeling lonely, who is feeling sick, who is feeling worried, are we there? Are we willing to give until it hurts in order to be with our families, or do we put our interest first? We must remember that love begins at home and we must also remember that future of humanity passes through the family.\" Mother Teresa's work has been recognised thought the world and she has received a number of awards.
