In Bangladesh poisonous exhausts from industrial plants, brick kilns, old or poorly serviced vehicles and dust from roads and construction sites are some of the major sources of air pollution. We can minimise this type of pollution by making less use of motor vehicles and avoiding the use of vehicles older than 20 years. We may also use proper lubricants to lessen the level of emission and pollutants. We can encourage people to use Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) or Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) for fuelling their cars. The government may relocate hazardous industries like brick kilns to areas away from human habitations.\n.\nAir is the most important element of human environment.

          "question": "",
          "explanation": "Tree Plantation\nTree plantation means planting trees on a large scale in a planned way. Trees are our friends. They give us shade and soothe our eyes with their green colour. They give us various kinds of fruits. They give us firewood as fuel for cooking. They give us timber for furniture, doors and windows, boats, electric poles, railway slippers, etc. They give us rubber too. Trees take in carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. Sufficient trees cause sufficient rainfall and prevent draught. Trees along the roadside and coastal areas preyent erosion and tidal bore. But many inconsiderate pcople are cutting down trees for their selfish interests. So, we are losing trees. If there is no tree, there will be no civilization. In fact, the loss of trees will take our existence to the verge of extinction. The earth will be no more habitable. Hence, tree plantation must be taken as a project. The more we plant trees, the morė our environment will be balanced and greener. In Bangladesh, tree plantation is compulsory because we do not have as much forest as we require to maintain the ecological balance. There is no specific time to plant trees. We can plant trees any time of the year based on the type of the trees. Park, yard, urban areas, open field, balcony, rooftops; roadside places, etc. are best places to plant trees. To make life peaceful, there is no alternative to tree plantation."

          "explanation": "\"The Scholar and the Boatman\"\nOnce there was a self-said scholar who was crossing a big river by an indigenous boat. As his common feature of character, he asked the boatman if he knew the rules of high and low tide. Telling nothing, the helpless boatman only gazed and gazed. The scholar smirked and remarked, “Half your life is wasted if you do not even know something so simple.”\nAfter a while, the scholar asked the boatman another question. “Do you know the principles of astronomy?” Again, the boatman stayed silent, shaking his head in ignorance. The scholar laughed mockingly, saying, “Then three-quarters of your life is wasted.”\nAs they were conversing, the sky began to darken, and storm clouds gathered above. The boat began to rock violently in the growing waves. Fear gripped both the boatman and the scholar.\nThe boatman then asked calmly, “Sir, do you know how to swim?” The scholar’s face turned pale as he stuttered, “N-no, I do not.”\nThe boatman then smiled and said, “I may not know astronomy or tides, but it seems your entire life is at risk now.” As the boat capsized in the raging storm, the humble boatman swam to safety while the self-proclaimed scholar struggled and cried for help.\nThis event taught the scholar that practical knowledge is just as important as theoretical knowledge, if not more."

          "explanation": "a. February 21 is a memorable day in our national history because on this day in 1952, the heroic son's of Bengal laid down their lives to establish Bangla as a state language of the undivided Pakistan. On this day, we pay tribute to the language martyrs because of their sacrifice for the rightful place of mother tongue.\nb. The then Governor General of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Zinnah, is responsible to raise a storm of protest. In a public meeting in Dhaka, he declared Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan, which disregarded the language rights of the Bangalee. Therefore, a mass protest started across the country.\nc. The Pakistani government banned all sorts of public meetings and gatherings to stop the protest that began following Mohammad Ali Jinnah's declaration of Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan and continued non-stop.\nd. Against the declaration of outlawing all sorts of public meeting and rallies, the students of Dhaka University brought out a peaceful protest procession on 21 February, defying the law.\ne. The Language Movement of 1952 kindled the sparks of independence movement in East Pakistan by making the Bangalees aware of their rights. Thus, the Language Movement is related to the independence movement of Bangladesh."
