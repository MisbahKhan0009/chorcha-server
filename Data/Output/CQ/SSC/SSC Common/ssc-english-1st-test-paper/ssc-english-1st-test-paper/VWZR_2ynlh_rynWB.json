          "question": "",
          "explanation": "(a) Humans can neither change the sun's radiation nor the earth's orbit around the sun, because these things are beyond their control.\n\n(b) Human beings do some unwise activities like burning too much fossil fuels, setting up more factories, cutting down trees indiscriminately, etc. that result in the increase of greenhouse gases. Thus, they are responsible for the increase in the greenhouse gases.\n\n(c) I think the main cause of the increase in carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels. With the increase of industrial activities, the combustion of coal has increased. Besides coal, mineral oil and natural gas are also burned for various purposes. Thus, every time a fossil raw material is burned, it releases carbon dioxide into the air.\n\n(d) Enormous areas of forests are destroyed by the people every year to obtain wood and to clear regions for mining and to create pasture."

We have a school magazine in our school. . To publish it smoothly, a magazine committee of usually nine members is formed in a general meeting. The members of the committee are chief patron, adviser, editor, assistant editors, business editors, proofreaders, assistant proofreaders, etc. The Headteacher holds the post of chief patron and a senior teacher becomes the adviser. The editor, business editors and the assistant proofreaders are selected from the students. A magazine fund is also made up from the school 'Magazine Fee'. The editor invites writings both in Bangla and English. Then, after proper scrutiny, the best ones are selected for publishing. The business editors collect some money by selling spaces in the magazine for advertisements. Generally, the magazine has two sections - Bangla and English. There are messages from the Headteacher and the Secretary of the school. There are also annual reports, essays, short stories, short plays, etc. in it. It also contains jokes, quizes and puzzles. Most of the articles are written by the students. A few articles are written by the teachers. A school magazine promoting team-spirit inspires to express the dormant power of thinking as well as writing of the young learners. It helps flourish themselves as future writers and poets.\n"

The situation became very unbearable but the people of Hamelin failed to think of a solution. Then one day, a strange man known as pied piper appeared in the town wearing strange clothes and carrying a pied piper. He claimed in front of the mayor that he could help the town get rid of the raits. It was a golden opportunity only a fool would miss. So, the mayor hired the stranger and promised him a thousand gold coins if he succeeded. Being satisfied with the offer, the pied piper started to play his pipe and walked through the streets of Hamelin. The sweet melody of the pipe brought the rats out in the street and had them trail behind the pied piper. The man cunningly brought the rats near the river and each of them was washed away with its strong current. Then he returned to the mayor to get his pay, but the mayor went back on his words. Enraged by the dishonesty, the stranger started playing his piep again and this time he lured out all the children from their homes. The children trailed behind him and he disappeared from the town with them for ever."

But I have heard that you are not keeping good company around you. It is, indeed, a bad news for me.\nIn your last annual exam, you did not perform well. Your marks were visibly poor. I believe the main reason for this demotion is the bad company you are keeping. The people you are having around these days are not attentive to studies. Studying hard and gaining knowledge are not their concerns. Also, some of them are heavily addicted to smoking. Some of them do not go to school regularly. If you continue mixing with them, it will affect your studies further. You will also develop bad habits like smoking, bunking off classes, being irregular in the classes, etc. So, I would request you to stay away from evil company.\n\nNo more today. Keep in touch.\n\nYour loving sister,\nAbida"
