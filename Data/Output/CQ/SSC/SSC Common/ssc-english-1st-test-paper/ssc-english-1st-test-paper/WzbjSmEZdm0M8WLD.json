Climate change is increasing the water temperature in rivers, lakes and seas. This means there is less food and oxygen available for fish. It also means the fish may not grow fully and may have fewer offsprings. Some fishes will become extinct if temperatures rise even by one or two degrees celsius.\nClimate change increases the pressure on fish population. Fishes are one of the world's most valuable biological assets. Forty percent of people in the world eat fish as their main source of protein. If we fail to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we will increase the pressure on fish. As a result, people who depend on fish will suffer from hunger and poverty.\n\nQuestion:\nIt is (a) — from the passage that global warming is (b) — great threat for fish population.

          "explanation": "Smartphone\nSmartphone refers to the mobile phone that has a touchscreen interface, an operating system capable of running different applications, the configuration of high-speed internet connection, and multimedia functions. The most common uses of smart phone are internet searching and web browsing. Other uses of smartphone are making phone call, listening to music, using social media apps, capturing and sharing photos and videos, etc. The effects of Smart phone on human life is huge. At present, there is hardly any person who doesn't have a smartphone. Smart phone has enabled' us to communicate with the people of the whole world in an instant. It has facilitated our life to a great extent. But alongside the huge number of benefits that we get from smart phone, it also brings about some troubles in our life. Access to huge number of data across the world through internet is a great threat to our creativity. It has also minimized our thirst for exploring the realm of knowledge that we are supposed to gain by participating physically in different expeditions. The smart phone has also expedited different kinds of cybercrimes. Many people, especially of young age, remain unnecessarily busy with browsing internet. Some people ate so obsessed in using internet that they behave in abnormal way. They cannot do much work in time due to wasting time in social media. To get rid of the abuses of smartphone, maintaining a strict schedule of work and increasing real life communication are effective ways. Besides, the parents should keep their children in close observation about their smart phone related activities. The government should adopt cybercrime law strictly to control abuses of smartphone. Thus, we all should control and be aware of the bad effects of smart phone."

So he ordered his men to cut down all the trees. Some opposed the King's idea but he did not pay any heed to them. All the trees, were cut, a palace was built and the King continued to live his day in pride inside the new shiny walls of his prized possession, It was only he who unconsciously and with folly kept living in the palace until he realized that his kingdom had begun to deteriorate. There was no rice in the granary, no fruit in the storehouse, no fish in the pond and no peace among the people. One afternoon, he took a step outside the palace and, for a second, mistook his green island for a barren land. The air was so uneomfortably warm that he even struggled to breathe. The common people outside his gate were watching him suffer in silence. With no delay, the King realized he had made a grave mistake and had lost his kingdom, his lands and his people. But it was not too late because he still had a little time left to fix his mistake. He couldn't but ask his people to help him save the island because he had now realized he was not the sole owner of it: The island belonged to everyone."

My neighbor's cousin just got hospitalized with dengue fever. It's terrifying how quickly it spreads. What’s going on exactly?\nSostika (Anu): It’s caused by mosquitoes, right? They breed in stagnant water. Once a person is bitten, they can get a high fever, severe body aches, and even bleeding. It can be deadly if not treated in time.\nTanzima (Khalid): I read that hospitals are overwhelmed with patients, and the doctors are struggling to keep up. It’s so scary! Even young people are getting affected. I think it's spreading faster than last year.\nSostika (Anu): Yeah, it’s really alarming. The worst part is that there's no specific medicine for dengue. Treatment mainly focuses on relieving the symptoms, like reducing the fever and staying hydrated. It’s crucial to catch it early.\nTanzima (Khalid): That’s true. It’s affecting so many people in our community. I’ve seen people talking about how important it is to eliminate standing water around the house, like in old tires or containers, to prevent mosquito breeding.\nSostika (Anu): Exactly! Everyone should be extra careful about that. Mosquito nets and repellents can also help. The government and health organizations are doing their best, but we all need to take responsibility to stop the spread.\nTanzima (Khalid): We definitely need to spread awareness. People still don't take mosquito control seriously, but if we don’t, this will keep getting worse.\nSostika (Anu): True. We should tell everyone to clean up their surroundings, especially with the rains coming. Prevention is the key! Let’s spread the word in our neighborhood too.\nTanzima (Khalid): Yes, let’s do that! It’s up to all of us to stop dengue from spreading further. Stay safe, Anu!\nSostika (Anu): You too, Tanzima! Let’s stay vigilant and protect ourselves and others."
