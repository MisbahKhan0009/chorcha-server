The American Psychological Association (APA) defines loneliness as the \"affective and cognitive discomfort or uneasiness' from being or perceiving oneself to be alone or otherwise solitary.\" In other words, loneliness is the mental or emotional discomfort you may experience from either being alone or feeling as though you are alone. This feeling stems from your social needs not being met and/or an inability to get the social connection you desire. Although loneliness and being alone are confused, being-alone doesn't necessarily mean someone is lonely. \"Loneliness is a feeling, while being alone is a situation or state of being, which is not inherently negative,\" says Nina Vasan, a psychiatrist and professor at Stanford University. \"You can feel lonely even when you're surrounded by other people such as a partner, family, co-workers or friends,\" continues Dr. Vasan. There are various demographic factors that may contribute to loneliness. Although Dr. Vasan notes that anyone can feel lonely at any time in their life; a few groups that stand out as having an increased risk of loneliness include \"young adults, mothers with young children and the elderly.\" Immigrants are also at higher risk for loneliness, continues Dr. Vasan. The discrepancy between what causes loneliness in older adults versus those who are middle-aged could be due to the fact that older adults have retired and no longer have the community and daily interactions of work life, explains Nikki Press. Older individuals are more -likely to have lost friends and family members, and they are more likely to experience medical or physical limitations that restrict their opportunities for activities and socialising, continues Dr. Press. Other causes of loneliness include: the death of a close friend or family member, physical isolation, like living alone or moving away from family and friends, illness or disability, retirement or working alone, etc. which are common. Just as the cause of loneliness can vary from person to person, coping and prevention strategies can also differ. In general, the goal is to make strong, healthy connections that fulfill your need for social inferaction. While there is no substitute for help from a mental health-professional, the following tips may help'you build emotional connections like finding hobbies you enjoy; volunteering for an organisation you support which will not only give you a sense of accomplishment and pride, but it's an opportunity to meet others who support that same organisation; joining support groups which are an excellent way to connect with others who you have something in common with, such as a mental or physical condition; routinely contacting family and friends for attempting to stay connected; maintaining a healthy diet and regular exercise regime. Regardless of your interests, it's important to listen to and fulfill your desire for social connection. It diminishes feelings of loneliness and improves the quality of your life.

          "explanation": "The Light of Patience\nIt was night, and rain was falling. softly. With a cup of coffee in her hand, Monica sat by the window .and watched the raindrops slide down the glass. The streets looked shiny and quiet in the rain. She could clearly hear the soft sound of water hitting the roof and the trees.\nMonica was waiting for her younger brother, Asif, who was supposed to arrive by the last train from university. He had called earlier but the train was delayed because of heavỳ rainfall. So, Monica was worried. She imagined the train stuck on the tracks or Asif waiting alone on a dark, wet platform. She kept checking her phone, but there were no new updates. The longer she waited, the more her worry turned into frustration. Just then, her eyes caught sight of a small, glowing light near the old grocery shop across the street. It was an elderly street vendor, usually selling balloons and small toys during the day. Now, he sat quietly, barely sheltering himself from the rain. He wasn't packing up; he wasn't complaining. He was simply waiting, calm and patient, reading a small book by the light of a small kerosene lamp.\nWatching him, Monica suddenly felt ashamed. This man, whose livelihood depended entirely on the weather and the crowds, was accepting the delay with grace. He wasn't worried about the things he couldn't control. Monica realized that worrying wouldn't speed up the train; it only wasted her present moment. A little while later, she saw Asif running with a huge yellow umbrella. He was safe and smiling. Monica ran to open the door. She had waited, and her patience had been rewarded with peace instead of pointless stress."
