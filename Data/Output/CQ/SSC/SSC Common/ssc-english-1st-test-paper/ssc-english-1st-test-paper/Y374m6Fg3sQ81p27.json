          "question": "",
          "explanation": "(a) Humans can neither change the sun's radiation nor the earth's orbit around the sun, because these things are beyond their control.\n\n(b) Human beings do some unwise activities like burning too much fossil fuels, setting up more factories, cutting down trees indiscriminately, etc. that result in the increase of greenhouse gases. Thus, they are responsible for the increase in the greenhouse gases.\n\n(c) I think the main cause of the increase in carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels. With the increase of industrial activities, the combustion of coal has increased. Besides coal, mineral oil and natural gas are also burned for various purposes. Thus, every time a fossil raw material is burned, it releases carbon dioxide into the air.\n\n(d) Enormous areas of forests are destroyed by the people every year to obtain wood and to clear regions for mining and to create pasture."

While gossiping she noticed two small boys quarrelling over a trifling matter. She did not take it seriously thinking that their quarrel would come to an end soon. But it turned out to be a serious one. At one point of time, one of the boys picked up a big stone to throw it to the other whereas the other boy started to throw pebbles at him one after another. Being hit by the pebbles, the boy with a heavy stone in his hand, became imbalanced and fell in the pond. In the water, he became so scared that he couldn't swim and started to drown. In the meantime, the other boy, being panicked, fled away. Lina and her friend saw the boy drowning and rushed to the spot. They cried for help but nobody was around. All of a sudden, Lina saw a fishing net nearby. She took the net and hurled it to the boy. When the boy got hold of the net, Lina and her friend pulled it with all their might and brought the drowning boy to the land. Meanwhile, some villagers gathered at the spot and took the boy to the hospital. The people then praised Lina for her ready wit and thus, she became a star of her village."

          "explanation": "The pie chart shows the subject preferences of students in a secondary school. It highlights their interest in four key subjects: Mathematics, Science, Bangla, and English. According to the chart, Mathematics is the most preferred subject, with 35% of the students showing interest in it. This is followed by Science, which attracts 25% of the students. Bangla is also popular, drawing the attention of 23% of the students. English, however, is the least chosen subject, with only 17% showing interest in it.\nFrom the data, it is clear that students tend to favor subjects related to logic and reasoning, such as Mathematics and Science, over languages. This could be due to the growing importance of science and technology in modern education and career paths. Nonetheless, the significant interest in Bangla reflects a continued appreciation for the mother tongue. Overall, the chart shows a balanced but slightly science-leaning academic interest among students."

It is praiseworthy that you're going well with your study. At the same time, I want to give you an advice to take physical exercise regularly. You know that \"A sound mind remains in a sound body.\" So, to keep your body fit, you should take physical exercise daily. You are already suffering from leg pain. Still you are not taking any sort of physical exercise. If you avoid doing exercise on a regular basis, your body will get rusty. You will feel uneasy all the times. Without soundness in your body, you will be inattentive to your study. But you should become careful of the rules of exercise. Otherwise, it may hamper your health. You must have a proper guideline for this. I think, you will inform me your details soon.\nHow're our parents? Convey my best wishes to Tuhin and Shaon. No more today.\n\nYour elder sister,\nRubina"

          "explanation": "a. February 21 is a memorable day in our national history because on this day in 1952, the heroic son's of Bengal laid down their lives to establish Bangla as a state language of the undivided Pakistan. On this day, we pay tribute to the language martyrs because of their sacrifice for the rightful place of mother tongue.\nb. The then Governor General of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Zinnah, is responsible to raise a storm of protest. In a public meeting in Dhaka, he declared Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan, which disregarded the language rights of the Bangalee. Therefore, a mass protest started across the country.\nc. The Pakistani government banned all sorts of public meetings and gatherings to stop the protest that began following Mohammad Ali Jinnah's declaration of Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan and continued non-stop.\nd. Against the declaration of outlawing all sorts of public meeting and rallies, the students of Dhaka University brought out a peaceful protest procession on 21 February, defying the law.\ne. The Language Movement of 1952 kindled the sparks of independence movement in East Pakistan by making the Bangalees aware of their rights. Thus, the Language Movement is related to the independence movement of Bangladesh."
