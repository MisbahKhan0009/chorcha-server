We can minimise this type of pollution by making less use of motor vehicles and avoiding the use of vehicles older than 20 years. We may also use proper lubricants to lessen the level of emission and pollutants. We can encourage people to use Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) or Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) for fuelling their cars.

          "explanation": "Our National Flag\n\nThe national flag of Bangladesh is a powerful symbol of the country’s identity, independence, and pride. It features a simple yet striking design: a red circle set slightly toward the hoist on a green rectangular field. The green background represents the lush greenery of Bangladesh, symbolizing the fertility, youth, and vitality of its land. The red circle signifies the rising sun and the blood of those who sacrificed their lives for the nation’s independence during the Liberation War of 1971. The flag’s design was first conceived during the early stages of the independence movement and was officially adopted on January 17, 1972. The flag reflects the country's struggle for freedom and its commitment to progress and peace. The red and green colors hold deep emotional significance for the people of Bangladesh, reminding them of their hard-won sovereignty and the resilience of their nation.\nThe national flag is prominently displayed on government buildings, schools, and public spaces during national holidays and celebrations such as Independence Day and Victory Day. It inspires a sense of unity and patriotism among the citizens. For the people of Bangladesh, their flag is not just a piece of cloth but a living symbol of their history, culture, and aspirations for a prosperous future."

          "explanation": "a. February 21 is a memorable day in our national history because on this day in 1952, the heroic son's of Bengal laid down their lives to establish Bangla as a state language of the undivided Pakistan. On this day, we pay tribute to the language martyrs because of their sacrifice for the rightful place of mother tongue.\nb. The then Governor General of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Zinnah, is responsible to raise a storm of protest. In a public meeting in Dhaka, he declared Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan, which disregarded the language rights of the Bangalee. Therefore, a mass protest started across the country.\nc. The Pakistani government banned all sorts of public meetings and gatherings to stop the protest that began following Mohammad Ali Jinnah's declaration of Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan and continued non-stop.\nd. Against the declaration of outlawing all sorts of public meeting and rallies, the students of Dhaka University brought out a peaceful protest procession on 21 February, defying the law.\ne. The Language Movement of 1952 kindled the sparks of independence movement in East Pakistan by making the Bangalees aware of their rights. Thus, the Language Movement is related to the independence movement of Bangladesh."
