          "explanation": "a. February 21 is a memorable day in our national history because on this day in 1952, the heroic son's of Bengal laid down their lives to establish Bangla as a state language of the undivided Pakistan. On this day, we pay tribute to the language martyrs because of their sacrifice for the rightful place of mother tongue.\nb. The then Governor General of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Zinnah, is responsible to raise a storm of protest. In a public meeting in Dhaka, he declared Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan, which disregarded the language rights of the Bangalee. Therefore, a mass protest started across the country.\nc. The Pakistani government banned all sorts of public meetings and gatherings to stop the protest that began following Mohammad Ali Jinnah's declaration of Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan and continued non-stop.\nd. Against the declaration of outlawing all sorts of public meeting and rallies, the students of Dhaka University brought out a peaceful protest procession on 21 February, defying the law.\ne. The Language Movement of 1952 kindled the sparks of independence movement in East Pakistan by making the Bangalees aware of their rights. Thus, the Language Movement is related to the independence movement of Bangladesh."

      "uddipok": "Zainul Abedin was born in Kishoregonj on 29 December, 1914. He spent most of his childhood near the scenic banks of the Brahmaputra river. The river and the open nature inspired him from his early life. The Brahmaputra later appeared in many of his paintings and remained a great source of inspiration throughout his career. As his tribute to the river Brahmaputra, he drew a series of water colour paintings in this regard. This helped him earn Governor's Gold Medal in all India Exhibition in 1938. This was the first time when he came under spotlight and this award gave Abedin the confidence to create his own visual style.\n\nAbedin got admitted to the Government School of Art in Calcutta (Now Government College of Art and Craft, Kolkata, India). Here, he leamed European academic style for five years. Later, he joined the faculty of the same school after his graduation. He was the first Muslim student to obtain 'First Class' with distinction from the school. In 1951, Zainul went to London to study at Slade School of Art for two years. From the dissatisfaction of oriental style and the limitations of European academic style, he was attracted to realism: After his return from London, he started a new style called 'Bengali Style'. Later, he realized the limitations of 'Bengali Style'. Therefore, he went back to nature, rural life and the daily struggles of men to make art that would be realistic but modern in appearance.\nSummarize the above text in your own words",

          "explanation": "COVID-19\n\nCOVID stands for Coronavirus Disease. It is termed coronavirus or COVID-19 since it first infected humans in 2019. Coronavirus primarily spreads through physical contact and, respiratory droplets. People with COVID-19 may have a wide range of symptoms. These may appear two to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. The common signs include fever, dry cough, tiredness; loss of taste or smell, muscle aches, headache, sore throat, runny nose, vomiting, diarrhoea, etc. Some people may experience worsened symptoms like acute shortness of breath and pneumonia. Older people and those with underlying medical problems such as heart disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and cancer are more likely to develop serious illnesses. Scientists around the world have invented some vaccines to boost our immune system for fighting coronavirus. Some of them are AstraZeneca, 'Pfizer. Moderna, Sinopharm, Sinovac, Sputnik V, etc. Though Bangladesh has invented a vaccine named Bangavax. , it is yet to be applied to human bodies. Besides, Molnupiravir, the first oral medicine for COVID-19. is now available in several countries. Still, preventive measures are the best ways to stay safe from COVID19. While going out, we must wear masks to cover our noses and mouth. We should thoroughly and regularly clean our hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. We should avoid touching the face, nose and eyes as the virus can enter our body through them. Moreover, while sneezing or coughing, we should cover our face and nose with a tissue or with the elbow. In addition to that, we should maintain a social distance of a minimum of 3 feet. Anyone with the possible symptoms must be isolated to avoid close contact with others. Therefore, staying safe from COVID-19 mostly depends on personal hygiene."

One of my neighbours died last night in a tragic road accident.\n\nJamal : Very sad news indeed! To speak the truth, nowadays it has become a common incident in our country.\n\nTamal : Yes, it's really a matter of serious concern nowadays but our policy makers* seem indifferent to the fact.\n\nJamal : Absolutely true. But can you tell me the causes of frequent road accidents across the country?\n\nTamal : The causes are manifold. Reckless driving, lack of skilled traffic police, ignorance of the drivers, tendency of overtaking, violation of traffic signals and rules, etc. contribute greatly to the frequent road accidents.\n\nJamal : You are absolutely right. The conditions of roads are extremely poor. These are also causing many road accidents.\n\nTamal : Right! Immediate steps should be taken to reduce road accidents. What do you think?\n\nJamal : Yes, of course. Strict laws should be introduced in this regard. Illiterate and careless drivers should be identified and their driving licenses should be cancelled.\n\nTamal : Certainly! Besides, drivers should be given proper training and the Roads and Highways Department should be more cautious in this regard.\n\nJamal : Absolutely! People should also be made aware of traffic rules and signals. In this way, we can minimize road accidents.\n\nTamal : You're right! We all have to come forward to raise public awareness in this concern.\n\nJamal : Exactly!\n\nTamal : Thank you very much for such a nice discussion.\n\nJamal : You're most welcome. See you again."

          "explanation": "(a) Humans can neither change the sun's radiation nor the earth's orbit around the sun, because these things are beyond their control.\n\n(b) Human beings do some unwise activities like burning too much fossil fuels, setting up more factories, cutting down trees indiscriminately, etc. that result in the increase of greenhouse gases. Thus, they are responsible for the increase in the greenhouse gases.\n\n(c) I think the main cause of the increase in carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels. With the increase of industrial activities, the combustion of coal has increased. Besides coal, mineral oil and natural gas are also burned for various purposes. Thus, every time a fossil raw material is burned, it releases carbon dioxide into the air.\n\n(d) Enormous areas of forests are destroyed by the people every year to obtain wood and to clear regions for mining and to create pasture."
