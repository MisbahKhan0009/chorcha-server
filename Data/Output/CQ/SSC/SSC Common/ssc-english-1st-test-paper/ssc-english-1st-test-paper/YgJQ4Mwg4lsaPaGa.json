          "explanation": "a. February 21 is a memorable day in our national history because on this day in 1952, the heroic son's of Bengal laid down their lives to establish Bangla as a state language of the undivided Pakistan. On this day, we pay tribute to the language martyrs because of their sacrifice for the rightful place of mother tongue.\nb. The then Governor General of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Zinnah, is responsible to raise a storm of protest. In a public meeting in Dhaka, he declared Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan, which disregarded the language rights of the Bangalee. Therefore, a mass protest started across the country.\nc. The Pakistani government banned all sorts of public meetings and gatherings to stop the protest that began following Mohammad Ali Jinnah's declaration of Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan and continued non-stop.\nd. Against the declaration of outlawing all sorts of public meeting and rallies, the students of Dhaka University brought out a peaceful protest procession on 21 February, defying the law.\ne. The Language Movement of 1952 kindled the sparks of independence movement in East Pakistan by making the Bangalees aware of their rights. Thus, the Language Movement is related to the independence movement of Bangladesh."

He took his graduation from the Central School of Engineering in Paris and went to work for a railway construction company. His mother thought that he would not go far. \"Be patient, mum. I've got some ideas. You'll see,\" Gustave assured his mother. For years, Gustave made plan after plan of dams, factories, stations and structures of great sized buildings. All over Europe, engineers copied them. In the middle of 1880s, a group of French industrialists persuaded the government to organize a World Fair in Paris. Oustave proposed a 989 feet tower of iron as a symbol of the fair. The construction of the tower began in January 1887. Forty engineers and designers worked under Gustave's direction for two years. The tower was finally completed in March 1889. It is the highest structure of iron made by man. No such structure had ever been constructed before. It is regarded as one of the wonders of the world.\nWrite a summary of the above passage in your own words.",

          "question": "",
          "explanation": "Tree Plantation\nTree plantation means planting trees on a large scale in a planned way. Trees are our friends. They give us shade and soothe our eyes with their green colour. They give us various kinds of fruits. They give us firewood as fuel for cooking. They give us timber for furniture, doors and windows, boats, electric poles, railway slippers, etc. They give us rubber too. Trees take in carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. Sufficient trees cause sufficient rainfall and prevent draught. Trees along the roadside and coastal areas preyent erosion and tidal bore. But many inconsiderate pcople are cutting down trees for their selfish interests. So, we are losing trees. If there is no tree, there will be no civilization. In fact, the loss of trees will take our existence to the verge of extinction. The earth will be no more habitable. Hence, tree plantation must be taken as a project. The more we plant trees, the morė our environment will be balanced and greener. In Bangladesh, tree plantation is compulsory because we do not have as much forest as we require to maintain the ecological balance. There is no specific time to plant trees. We can plant trees any time of the year based on the type of the trees. Park, yard, urban areas, open field, balcony, rooftops; roadside places, etc. are best places to plant trees. To make life peaceful, there is no alternative to tree plantation."

At last, he saw a jar. He peeped into the jar and saw that there was a little water at the bottom of the jar. He tried to drink water but his bill could not reach it. He tried again and again but in vain. He became very sad and hopeless. Suddenly, he saw some small pieces of stone near the jar. A good idea came into his head. He picked up the stones and dropped them into the jar one by one. As a result, the water came up to the brim. The crow then drank water from it to his heart's content and flew away with a joyful mind."

As you know, our SSC exams are finally over, and I’m sure you’re as relieved as I am! With the winter vacation ahead, I’ve decided to spend a fortnight at our village home. I was wondering if you would like to join me and spend this vacation together.\nOur village is simply enchanting during the winter. The mornings are misty and serene, with the sun slowly breaking through the fog. The fields are lush and green, and the fresh air is a welcome change from the city’s hustle and bustle. We can take long walks by the river, explore the countryside, and enjoy delicious homemade food prepared by my grandmother.\nThere’s also a fair happening in the village during the last week of the vacation, and I’ve heard it’s going to be a grand event. We can take part in various activities, meet the villagers, and even go fishing or boating in the nearby pond. I’m sure you’ll find it a delightful experience!\nLet me know as soon as you can if you’re able to join me so I can make the necessary arrangements. I’m really looking forward to spending this vacation with you and creating memories we’ll cherish forever.\nTake care and do write back soon!\nWarm regards, Rohan"
