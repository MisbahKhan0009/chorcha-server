      "uddipok": "It was late summer, 26 August 1910. A little girl was born to a rich Catholic merchants' family of Albanian descent in a small town called Skopje, Macedonia. She was the youngest of the three siblings and was named Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu. Who could imagine at the time that this little girl would one day become the mother of humanity, loving and serving the poorest of the poor. Yes, we are talking about none other than Mother Teresa.\n\nAt the age of 12, she heard a voice from within that urged her to spread the love of Christ. She decided that she would be a missionary. At the age of 18 , she left her parental home. She then joined an Irish community of nuns called the Sisters of Loreto, which had missions in India.\n\nAfter a few months of training at the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Dublin, Mother Teresa came to India. On May 24, 1931, she took her initial vows as a nun. From 1931 to 1948, Mother Teresa taught geography and theology at St. Mary's High School in Kolkata (then Calcutta). However, the widespread poverty in Kolkata had a deep impact on Mother Teresa and in 1948, she received permission from her superiors to leave the convent and devote herself to caring for the poorest of the poor in the slums of Kolkata.\n\nFor the contribution to humanity, she was awarded the Noble Peace Prize in 1979. She died at the age of 87 , on 5 September, 1997.\nWrite a summary of the above passage in your own words.",

          "explanation": "A Village Fair I Experienced\n\nA village fair is a gathering of a large number of village people who get together to buy or sell goods in a festive manner. Usually, it is held on certain occasions like Pahela Baishakh, Puja, etc. It is held in an open place or by the bank of a river or canal. Various kinds of goods are displayed there for buying and selling. Everyone from children to the old gather there. People visit the fair to buy things and to enjoy. Last year, I had an opportunity to visit such a fair in my village. It was held on the occasion of Pahela Baishakh. I woke up early and went there with my cousins and friends. Traders came from far and near to sell their goods. They set up, their stalls with goods, such as toys, sweetmeat, cosmetics, jute and cotton handicrafts, bamboo-made goods and many more attractive items. We explored the fair till afternoon. In the fair, we ate some traditional food. I bought bangles, earthen and wooden showpieces from the fair. I bought some gifts for my family members too. We also enjoyed the ride on Merry-Go-Round, puppet show, magic show, circus and 'jatra'. It was, indeed, a memorable 'day for me. Such a fair plays an important role in our economy as it was a selling centre of various useful things made by the rural artisans and craftsmen"

      "uddipok": "Everyone must play a part in protecting the environment. There are many things you can do on your own every day to help save the planet. Here are some suggestions.\nREDUCE!\nReally, the best thing we can do for the planet is to use its resources properly. Our unplanned activities are mainly responsible for the environmental crisis. Here are some questions you can ask yourself before buying something, \"Do 1 really need this?\" or \"Is there another product which would do the same thing but more sustainable?\" Or ask the question, \"Will this last a long time?\" Some other questions may be, \"Do I know how this item was made, how it will be used and how it will be disposed of?\"\nREUSE!\nWhat do you think of using your own ceramic cup or mug at your school or local club? It means there are no plastic cups to throw away. You can wash it and reuse it every day. Unfortunately, we are encouraged to buy a new \"improved\" item even if the one we have can be repaired or reused. When we buy things, we should buy those that are durable; we should use them properly, and have them repaired when necessary. If we practise this, many things will not only last a life-time, but also be passed on for future use. However, if something is truly unusable for its original purposes, try to be more creative and think of how else it might be used. When you're done with it, think of whether someone else might be able to use it. You can donate some of the things to the poor. You may also sell some of your used items through personal advertisements in a local newspaper or in social media.\nRECYCLE!\nRather than throwing an item out when neither you nor anyone else can make use of it, have it recycled. And if recycling is not possible, it is better to send goods to a landfill or have them burned up. Find out what types of materials can be recycled in your area. Clean and sort the materials before putting them out in the bin. Recycling your drink and food cans means there will be less trash in a resource recovery facility or landfill. Moreover, a company can use the old cans to make new ones.",
