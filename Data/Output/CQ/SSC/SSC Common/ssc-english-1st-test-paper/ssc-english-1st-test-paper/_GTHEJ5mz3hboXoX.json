Some fishes will become extinct if temperatures rise even by one or two degrees celsius.\nClimate change increases the pressure on fish population. Fishes are one of the world's most valuable biological assets. Forty percent of people in the world eat fish as their main source of protein.

          "explanation": "Tree Plantation\nTree plantation means planting trees on a large scale in a planned way. Trees are our friends. They give us shade and soothe our eyes with their green colour. They give us various kinds of fruits. They give us firewood as fuel for cooking. They give us timber for furniture, doors and windows, boats, electric poles, railway slippers, etc. They give us rubber too. Trees take in carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. Sufficient trees cause sufficient rainfall and prevent draught. Trees along the roadside and coastal areas preyent erosion and tidal bore. But many inconsiderate pcople are cutting down trees for their selfish interests. So, we are losing trees. If there is no tree, there will be no civilization. In fact, the loss of trees will take our existence to the verge of extinction. The earth will be no more habitable. Hence, tree plantation must be taken as a project. The more we plant trees, the morė our environment will be balanced and greener. In Bangladesh, tree plantation is compulsory because we do not have as much forest as we require to maintain the ecological balance. There is no specific time to plant trees. We can plant trees any time of the year based on the type of the trees. Park, yard, urban areas, open field, balcony, rooftops; roadside places, etc. are best places to plant trees. To make life peaceful, there is no alternative to tree plantation."

          "explanation": "Sheikh Saadi's Wit/Tit for Tat\nThe king of Iran used to invite the great poet Sheikh Saadi very often to his court. Once, on his way to the king's court, the poet took shelter in a nobleman's house for a night. He was then wearing a very ordinary and cheap cloth. The nobleman could not recognize him and did not behave well with him. On the next day, Sheikh Saadi left the place for the court of the king and was received with honour. He stayed there for a few days and received rich gifts from the king. On his way back to home, he again visited that rich man's house wearing a costly and gorgeous dress. This time, the rich man treated him with the best of the foods and comfort. While eating, he was surprised to see the rich delicious food and understood the rich man's attitude. Sheikh Saadi then instead of eating the food, started putting them into the pockets of his rich cloth. Being astonished, the rich man asked him about his mysterious\nbehaviour. The poet answered that the given food was for his dress as he failed to get same treatment when he was in very simple dress. The rich man realized his earlier folly and became ashamed."
