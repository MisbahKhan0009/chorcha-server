          "explanation": "Dengue Fever\nDengue is a painful, debilitating mosquito-borne disease, borne .by Aedes mosquito. Tropical areas, like Indian Subcontinent, Southeast Asia, Southern China, Taiwan, the Pacific. Islands, the Caribbean, Mexico, Africa, Central, and South America are the most vulnerable areas of the world where Dengue Fever is likely to occur. Symptoms of Dengue usually begin four to six days after infection and last up to ten days. Symptoms may include sudden high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, severe joint and muscle pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, skin rash and mild bleeding. These symptoms may progress to massive bleeding, shock, and death. People with weakened immune systems are believed to be at greater risk for developing Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever. A person with Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever may experience damage to lymph and blood vessels; internal bleeding which can-lead to black vomit and feces; a lower number of platelets in the blood; sensitive stomach and weak pulse. Surprisingly, till today, there is no specific treatment for dengue infection. Doctors generally suggest the infected people to take rest and drink plenty of fluids, If the situation worsens, the patient must be hospitalized. One of the effective ways to prevent Dengue Fever is to prevent bites by infected mosquitoes. We should keep in mind that currently there is no vaccine to prevent the disease for the general population from contracting it. The best way to lessen the risk of Dengue infection is to reduce the production of Aedes 'mosquito. We can do that by taking effective measures such as keeping our living places and neighborhoods clean. However, it is interesting to know that Aedes mosquito requires just one teaspoon ofwater to lay its eggs and and for the larvae to fully develop into an,adult mosquito. So, it can practically breed in any place where clean standing water is.available. So, we must also remove clogged and accumulated water so that Aedes mosquitoes cannot breed."

          "explanation": "A Shelter Made of Care\nOne day while crossing the bridge at New Market, I saw a poor family seeking shelter. I approached them and asked about their problem. Then they said that flood had destroyed their house, their land, and everything they had owned in the village. \"We have no home now,\" the mother whispered, holding a sleeping baby wrapped in a wet towel. \"We came to Dhaka... hoping someone would help us.\" They had never been to the city before. Everything looked strange, loud, and frightening. The father sat quietly, his face pale and tired. The little girl beside him was crying. I stood there, frozen. For a moment, I didn't know what to do. Then I remembered what my mother always said: \"If you can help someone, do it don't wait.\" I rushed home and told my parents. My mother packed cooked rice and boiled eggs. My father called a nearby shelter and arranged a place for them to stay that night. The next day, he spoke to a garage owner and got the father a small job. The mother was offered work in a nearby mess. The children were admitted to a free evening school. A week later, I visited them. The father stood up and gently placed his hand on my head. His eyes were full of tears. The little girl held my hand tightly and didn't want to let go. I felt their touch was full of gratitude."

          "explanation": "The pie chart shows the percentage of Ahmed’s improvement in various subjects in his Pre-Test Examination this year. According to the chart, Ahmed made the most progress in Mathematics , with a significant 40% improvement. This indicates that he likely put extra effort into this subject or received better support. The second-highest improvement is seen in Chemistry , where he improved by 25% . This is also quite notable and shows considerable dedication.\nIn Physics , Ahmed improved by 20% , which is a decent performance as well. Lastly, his improvement in English is the lowest among the subjects, standing at only 15% . This suggests that he may need to focus more on English to bring it up to the level of his other subjects.\nOverall, the chart highlights Ahmed’s strong performance in Math and Science subjects, while also showing the need for more attention in English. His improvement shows promise for future exams."

I am writing this email because I came to know that you are not very interested in games and sports. I think this is not good for your health and daily life. So, I want to share how important games and sports are for us.\nFirst of all, games and sports help us to keep our body fit and strong. When we play, our blood circulatės properly, and it keeps away many diseases. Secondly, games develop our mental strength. They refresh our mind after long hours of study and help us stay focused. Sports also teach discipline, teamwork, leadership, and time management. These qualities are very important for success in life.\nTherefore, I suggest you to take part in any game you like, such as football, cricket, badminton, or anything else. I hope you will think about it seriously and start playing regularly.\n\nBest wishes to you.\nYour loving friend,\nSumon"

Trust me, waking up early makes you feel more energetic and focused. Plus, you can enjoy the peaceful morning atmosphere.\nTalha: Hmm, that actually sounds nice. Do you wake up early every day?\nShakir: I try to. I go for a short walk, enjoy the fresh air, and it really helps me concentrate better in class.\nTalha: Alright, I’ll give it a try.

      "uddipok": "Read the passage. The answer the questions below:\nEid is the main religious festival of the Muslims in Bangladesh. Eid means happiness. Everyone wants to share this happiness with near and dear ones. So most of the people, who are living outside their homes for different reasons have a strong desire to get back home during the Eid vacation. As a rresult, there is a mad rush to board buses, trains, or launches for going home. This often causes transport accidents that take away many lives. However, these cannot stop people from going home to meet their family, inlaws, or friends. What makes people rush for their homes in spite of serious hazards? This is nothing but people's desire to return to the roots.\nDo human beings have roots like the trees? The answer is 'yes' but unlike the roots of the trees they are invisible, they lie in our minds. It's these roots that make a bond between us and family members, in-laws, friends, neighbours or even between us and the land where we were born and grew up. In that sense our families, our land of birth, relatives, our culture, traditions, or surroundings are our roots. And wherever we stay; we feel the power of our roots. It's our roots that develop our identity making us what we are. When we lose that bond, we become rootless. Human beings who do not have any roots are a non-entity. In other words, they do not have an identity. They don't know where they are from, and/or where they are heading to. This often makes them feel empty and lost.\nChoose the correct answer from the alternatives:",
