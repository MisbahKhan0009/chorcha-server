It is a public holiday in almost all the countries of the world.\nSince the Indtustrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries in Europe and the US, the workers in mills and factories had been working a long shift, fourteen or even more hours a day. On May 1st in 1886, inspired by the trade unions, half of the workers at the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company in Chicago went on strike demanding an eight-hour workday. Two days later, a workers' rally was held near the McCormick Harvester Machine Company and about 6000 workers joined it. The rally was addressed by the labour leaders. They urged the workers to stand together, to go on with their struggle and not to give in to their bosses. At one point of the rally, some strikebreakers started leaving the meeting place. The strikers went down the street to bring them back. Suddenly, about 200 policemen attacked them with clubs and revolvers. One striker was killed instantly, five or six others were seriously wounded and many others were injured. The events of May 1, 1886 are a reminder that workers will continue to be exploited until they stand up and, speak out to gain better working conditions, better pay and better lives.\nChoose the best answer from the alternatives:",

          "explanation": "Our School Magazine\nA school magazine is a periodical publication that contains the literary works and other information of a school. It is published once a year. We have a school magazine in our school. The name of our school magazine is 'Dipshikha'.. To publish it smoothly, a magazine committee of usually nine members is formed in a general meeting. The members of the committee are chief patron, adviser, editor, assistant editors, business editors, proofreaders, assistant proofreaders, etc. The Headteacher holds the post of chief patron and a senior teacher becomes the adviser. The editor, business editors and the assistant proofreaders are selected from the students. A magazine fund is also made up from the school 'Magazine Fee'. The editor invites writings both in Bangla and English. Then, after proper scrutiny, the best ones are selected for publishing. The business editors collect some money by selling spaces in the magazine for advertisements. Generally, the magazine has two sections - Bangla and English. There are messages from the Headteacher and the Secretary of the school. There are also annual reports, essays, short stories, short plays, etc. in it. It also contains jokes, quizes and puzzlės. Most of the articles are written by the students. A few articles are written by the teachers. A school magazine promoting team-spirit inspires to express the dormant power of thinking as well as writing of the young learners. It helps flourish themselves as future writers and poets."

          "explanation": "King Midas: The Golden Touch\nOnce upon a time, there was a king called Midas. He was very rich. Yet he always longed for more riches. Moreover, he was fond of gold though he had a lot of it. He thought if he had the golden touch, he would be the happiest man. A wise God granted his wish promptly. One morning, he got up early and started walking around in his garden as usual and touched a white rose in the garden. Then he saw, to his utter surprise, that the flower had turned into a piece of white gold. He was amazed and touched another plant which, in an instant, turned into gold. It was really amusing to him. He started playing with his new found blessing. Right at this moment, his only daughter entered the garden. When he embraced his daughter to share his delight with her, to his sheer grief, he found her being turned into a statue of gold. He became very shocked at this and prayed to God to take back the destructive blessing. After a few moments, the girl came to life. The king became happy."

In your last e- mail, you wanted to know what I would, do after my SSC Examination. I have made up my mind to do a course on communicative English. You know, I'm good at English grammar. My writing skill is not so bad, you know. But I'm still afraid of speaking in English. So, to improve my speaking and listening skills, my teacher suggested me to do the course. I think I could improve myself by doing such a course.\nNo more today. Please, pray for me.\n\nYour loving friend,\nAhnaf"

You often feel drowsy in the classroom. You should try to go to bed early and wake up early.\nRobin: I know, but I watch TV or use my phone at night. That's why I sleep late.\nFardin: That's not good, Robin. Early risingis very important for our health and study.\nRobin: Really? How does it help?\nFardin: When you wake up early, your mind stays fresh. You can study in the morning with better focus.\nRobin: That sounds good. But I feel lazy in the morning.\nFardin: It's just a habit. If you sleep early, you'll wake up fresh. Morning air is also good for health.\nRobin: I often miss breakfast too because I wake up late.\nFardin: That's another problem. Early rising gives you enough time to eat, exercise, and get ready without hurry.\nRobin: You're right, Fardin. I will try to go to bed early from today.\nFardin: That's great! You'll see the difference soon.\nRobin: Thanks for your advice, friend.\nFardin: Anytime, Robin!"
