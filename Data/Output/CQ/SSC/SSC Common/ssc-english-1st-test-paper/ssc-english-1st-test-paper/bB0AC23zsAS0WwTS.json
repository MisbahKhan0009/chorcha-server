      "uddipok": "\"Today there are many jobs where you need English. This is because the world has become smaller. Vast distances are shortened by speedy transports. We can talk to a person thousands of kilometres away on the phone or the Internet. So, we can communicate with the whole world easily. English has made this communication easier.\n\nThere are many countries in the world with many languages, but to communicate with them, you cannot use all the languages. So, you need a common language that you can use with more or less all the people in the world. English is that common language. You can talk to a Chinese toy maker, a French artist, an Arab ambassador or a Korean builder in one language - English.\n\nEnglish for us in Bangladesh is all the more important. As we have seen earlier, we are too many people in a small country. So, if you learn English, you have the best opportunity to find a good job, both within and outside the country. And that is good news for millions of our unemployed youths.\" \"But Miss, we learn English for 12 or 14 years, yet we do not find good jobs\", says Rumi. She then tells the class about what happened to her brother. \"Could you please tell us why?\" Rumi asks. \"This is a very important question, Rumi: We should learn how to use English both orally and in writing for doing things as needed in our work, such as communicating with others at personal, social, national and international levels. But unfortunately, at the moment we are learning English mainly for our exams,\" continues Miss Choudhury. \"Remember, English can greatly help you become skilled workers.\"\n\n\"But where and how can we learn this kind of English, Miss?\" asks Ratan. Ms Choudhury says, \"We can learn English both in ánd outside the classroom. Besides your textbooks, the radio, television, newspapers, magazines, computers and other supplementary materials will greatly help you. During our classroom activities, we'll see how we can learn English.\"\nMatch the parts of the sentences in column A A A , column B B B and column C C C to write four complete sentences.\nColumn A\nColumn B\nColumn C\n(a) Nowadays we can communicate\n(i) to get a good job both inside and outside the country\n(i) and that is English\n(b) But the language\n(ii) with a person living anywhere in the world\n(ii) by learning English\n(c) To communicate with anyone living anywhere\n(iii) is not the same\n(iii) on the phone or the internet\n(d) One can have an opportunity\n(iv) we need a common language\n(iv) in all the countries",

A tea stall is very common both in towns and villages in our country. It usually sits at a crowded place. It is found in a market place, a square, a bus stand, a railway station and near schools and colleges. In a tea stall, usually, tea is served to the customers in exchange of money. But biscuits, bananas, cigarettes, betel leaves, some other snacks are also sold there. Though some tea stalls are well-furnished, most of them are poorly furnished. It is usually decorated with chairs, tables and benches. People go to a tea stall usually to take a cup of tea to remove their tiredness. A tea stall is kept open from early morning till late night. In a tea stall there are 'generally two people to manage and run it. One is a grown up man who prepares tea and takes bill from the customers, and the other is a young boy who serves tea, biscuits, etc. to the customers. Sometimes, people come to a tea stall in a group and raise a storm over the cup. They discuss about politics, daily affairs, various problems and what not. That is why, it is sometimes called a 'mini sangsad'. After all, it can be said that a tea stall is a useful place for many people."

Arif asked the woman why she was begging. In reply, she told him that she was once one of the richest women in a town. But fate has brought her on the streets making her beg for money. Saying this, the woman started to cry which caught Arif off guard. He asked her whether she would like to drink some warm tea since the weather was cold. The offer brought a smile on the woman's wrinkled face. Near the dying river, there was an old tea store that Arif loved to visit. So he took the woman there for some tea. When he came to order their drinks at the counter, the owner told him that his companion told the strangest tales. No one knew where she came from and she had told thousand different stories to everyone who asked. With two cups of tea and newly learnt information, Arif returned to the old woman confused. The old woman smiled at him and began telling him about how she lost all her money to a fire. Arif took slow sips of his drink and started listening to the story in astonishment."

          "explanation": "The pie chart shows the subject preferences of students in a secondary school. It highlights their interest in four key subjects: Mathematics, Science, Bangla, and English. According to the chart, Mathematics is the most preferred subject, with 35% of the students showing interest in it. This is followed by Science, which attracts 25% of the students. Bangla is also popular, drawing the attention of 23% of the students. English, however, is the least chosen subject, with only 17% showing interest in it.\nFrom the data, it is clear that students tend to favor subjects related to logic and reasoning, such as Mathematics and Science, over languages. This could be due to the growing importance of science and technology in modern education and career paths. Nonetheless, the significant interest in Bangla reflects a continued appreciation for the mother tongue. Overall, the chart shows a balanced but slightly science-leaning academic interest among students."
