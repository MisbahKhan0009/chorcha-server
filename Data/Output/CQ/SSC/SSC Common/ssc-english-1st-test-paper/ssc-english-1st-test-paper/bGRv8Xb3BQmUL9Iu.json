We have a school magazine in our school. . To publish it smoothly, a magazine committee of usually nine members is formed in a general meeting. The members of the committee are chief patron, adviser, editor, assistant editors, business editors, proofreaders, assistant proofreaders, etc. The Headteacher holds the post of chief patron and a senior teacher becomes the adviser. The editor, business editors and the assistant proofreaders are selected from the students. A magazine fund is also made up from the school 'Magazine Fee'. The editor invites writings both in Bangla and English. Then, after proper scrutiny, the best ones are selected for publishing. The business editors collect some money by selling spaces in the magazine for advertisements. Generally, the magazine has two sections - Bangla and English. There are messages from the Headteacher and the Secretary of the school. There are also annual reports, essays, short stories, short plays, etc. in it. It also contains jokes, quizes and puzzles. Most of the articles are written by the students. A few articles are written by the teachers. A school magazine promoting team-spirit inspires to express the dormant power of thinking as well as writing of the young learners. It helps flourish themselves as future writers and poets.\n"

          "explanation": "Mr. Rahman's Kindness\nMr. Rahman is a retired officer. Usually he goes for a walk every day early in the morning. One day, while he was walking in the morning, he saw a man lying senseless by the side of the road. He went nearer to the man, and with a shock discovered that it was his childhood friend, Mr. Raihan, lying there wounded. Someone must have hit him while taking all his belongings. Panic seized Mr. Rahman immediately though this could have been a moment of joy for both the friends. It had been almost 7 years since they last met. He quickly gathered himself and started looking for help. Ten more valuable minutes went by before he could find a pick-up van. With the help of the driver, Mr. Rahman managed to take his wounded friend on the van. They rushed to the nearby hospital. Mr. Rahman took Mr. Raihan to the emergency of the hospital. Doctors checked him; thankfully, the injuries were not fatal and he gained consciousness within half an hour. Seeing his friend at his bedside, Mr, Raihan fell into tears. Mr. Rahman asked what had happened to him. With some difficulty, he could understand that his friend was attacked by professional goons when he left the airport in a rented car. The driver was associated with the gang and helped in the hijacking. Mr. Raihan wanted to see his family, after years, and this unfortunate event completely shook him off balance. However, Mr. Raihan was grateful that Mr. Rahman was there beside him like an angel sent from heaven.\nTears of joy and relief ran down his cheek. The dearest of friends were reunited though through an unfortunate event like this.\n"

It should be mentioned that he has got highest marks in English, which is 87, while he has got the lowest marks in Mathematics ( 60 marks) and got only 3.5 points in it. Karim has missed the highest grade point in Bangla only for 5 mark. He has got 75 marks here and has to be satisfied with 4 point in it. Finally, the total GPA (Grade Point Average) obtained by Karim is 4.50 . The overall performance of Karim is not unsatisfactory. If he could obtain a handsome mark in Mathematics, his total GPA would rise at a pleasant level.\n"

Thank you for the card you sent me along with your letter. In your writing, you wanted to know the details about my study tour to the historical place in Sonargaon, Narayanganj.\nWell, it was in the last month. The students of classes 9 − 10 9-10 9 − 10 arranged the study tour. Two of our honourable teachers supervised the whole tour. We 'started to gather at the school gate around 7:00 am in the morning. It was pretty cold but the sight of our tour bus made us excited. The bus started off before 8 am . Soon the breakfast was served. We reached Sonargaon by 9 : 30 a m 9: 30 \\mathrm{am} 9 : 30 am . It was a jaw-dropping experience when we entered the historical Panam city. We all were impressed by the serene sight. I personally felt as if we had been walking through the history book. The spooky but enchanting ancient doors of the buildings around us boggled our mind. We took-many photographs. Some of the members got busy taking selfie using their smart phones. We also took group photographs. One of the most interesting aspects of the tour was a brief class lecture by our teachers while we-were inspecting the architecture of the ancient buildings. We learned that those historical buildings were built centuries ago and are related with the history of Baro Bhuiyan. As the capital of the 15 th 15^{\\text {th }} 1 5 th century Bengal ruler Isa Khan; Sonargaon showcases the architecture of the Sultanates, Mughal and colonial periods. It was really an unforgettable experience for me. No more today. My best wishes will always be with you. Convey my regards to your parents.\n\nYours ever,\n\nShahin\n"

That’s actually a great topic. I think it’s a bit of both. Mobile phones are super helpful for staying connected and accessing information, but they also have their downsides.\nNoha: Totally agree. Like, one of the biggest merits is easy communication. We can call, text, or video chat with friends and family anytime.\nMahin: Yeah, and educational apps and online resources make studying easier too. We can watch tutorials, join online classes, and even do research quickly.\nNoha: Right. But on the flip side, many teens get addicted to social media and games. That really affects their studies and sleep.\nMahin: Exactly. And some even suffer from anxiety or low self-esteem because of comparing themselves to others on social media.\nNoha: Another issue is less face-to-face interaction. I feel like teens are losing social skills because they’re always on their phones.\nMahin: True. Plus, spending too much time staring at screens can cause eye problems and other health issues.\nNoha: But still, if we use mobile phones responsibly, they can be very useful. It’s all about balance, right?\nMahin: Definitely. Using phones wisely can make teenage life easier and more productive, but overuse can lead to serious problems.\nNoha: Well said, Mahin. I think every teen should know both sides before using a phone too much.\nMahin: For sure. Awareness is the first step to using technology in a healthy way"

          "explanation": "a. February 21 is a memorable day in our national history because on this day in 1952, the heroic son's of Bengal laid down their lives to establish Bangla as a state language of the undivided Pakistan. On this day, we pay tribute to the language martyrs because of their sacrifice for the rightful place of mother tongue.\nb. The then Governor General of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Zinnah, is responsible to raise a storm of protest. In a public meeting in Dhaka, he declared Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan, which disregarded the language rights of the Bangalee. Therefore, a mass protest started across the country.\nc. The Pakistani government banned all sorts of public meetings and gatherings to stop the protest that began following Mohammad Ali Jinnah's declaration of Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan and continued non-stop.\nd. Against the declaration of outlawing all sorts of public meeting and rallies, the students of Dhaka University brought out a peaceful protest procession on 21 February, defying the law.\ne. The Language Movement of 1952 kindled the sparks of independence movement in East Pakistan by making the Bangalees aware of their rights. Thus, the Language Movement is related to the independence movement of Bangladesh."
