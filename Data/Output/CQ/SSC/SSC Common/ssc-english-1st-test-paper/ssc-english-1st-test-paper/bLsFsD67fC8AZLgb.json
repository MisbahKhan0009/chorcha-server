          "explanation": "(a) Humans can neither change the sun's radiation nor the earth's orbit around the sun, because these things are beyond their control.\n\n(b) Human beings do some unwise activities like burning too much fossil fuels, setting up more factories, cutting down trees indiscriminately, etc. that result in the increase of greenhouse gases. Thus, they are responsible for the increase in the greenhouse gases.\n\n(c) I think the main cause of the increase in carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels. With the increase of industrial activities, the combustion of coal has increased. Besides coal, mineral oil and natural gas are also burned for various purposes. Thus, every time a fossil raw material is burned, it releases carbon dioxide into the air.\n\n(d) Enormous areas of forests are destroyed by the people every year to obtain wood and to clear regions for mining and to create pasture."

The editor invites writings both in Bangla and English. Then, after proper scrutiny, the best ones are selected for publishing. The business editors collect some money by selling spaces in the magazine for advertisements. Generally, the magazine has two sections - Bangla and English. There are messages from the Headteacher and the Secretary of the school. There are also annual reports, essays, short stories, short plays, etc. in it. It also contains jokes, quizes and puzzles. Most of the articles are written by the students. A few articles are written by the teachers. A school magazine promoting team-spirit inspires to express the dormant power of thinking as well as writing of the young learners. It helps flourish themselves as future writers and poets.\n"

          "explanation": "\"The Lion and the Mouse.\"\nOnce a lion was sleeping in a cave. Suddenly, a mouse came there. It did not notice the sleeping lion. It was running about and playing nearby. By chance, the mouse ran over the lion's face and tickled its nose with its tiny feet. The lion woke up with a loud roar, startled and furious. With a swift paw, it caught the mouse. Trembling with fear, the mouse begged for its life, saying, \"Please spare me, O King of the Jungle! If you let me go, I promise to help you someday.\"\nThe lion laughed at the thought of such a tiny creature helping a mighty beast like himself but decided to let the mouse go. \"You are too small to be a meal anyway,\" the lion said, releasing the mouse. The mouse scurried away, thankful for the lion's mercy.\nA few days later, the lion was caught in a hunter's net while prowling through the forest. Struggling to free himself, the lion roared in frustration, shaking the entire jungle. Hearing the loud roars, the mouse hurried to the scene. Recognizing the lion, the mouse said, \"Don't worry, I will help you.\"\nThe little mouse began gnawing at the thick ropes of the net with its sharp teeth. Slowly but surely, the net weakened and broke, setting the lion free. Grateful, the lion said, \"I underestimated you, little friend. Today, you taught me that even the smallest creature can do great deeds.\"\nThe two became unlikely friends, proving that kindness and gratitude transcend size and strength."

He pointed out that the era of wood and bio-mass has almost come to an end. The age of oil and natural gas would soon be over within the next few decades. Massive burning of world's coal reserves may lead to a worldwide ecological disaster because coal burning emits the highest amount of carbon in the atmosphere. So according to Kalam, the only solution that mankind can look to is the massive use of solar energy in future because it has some advantages over other forms of renewable energies. Now why has Kalam put so much importance to the issue of energy? The energy sources have always been a major factor of change throughout history. The world's petroleum consumption has increased from 3 billion barrels annually in 1930 to 37 billion barrels annually today. In the next quarter century, the world's population is expected to be about 8 billion which is 30 percent higher than today. Developing countries will grow their economics about two times faster than industrialised countries. Global economic growth is expected to continue at 3 percent per year. Consequently, the global demand for energy will grow at about 1.7 percent per year on an average. It indicates a 50 percent rise of energy consumption by 2030. If the world's daily petroleum consumption is 100 million barrels now, it will rise to 150 million barrels by that time. The present reserve of hydro-carbon energy resources is limited and it will not be sufficient to meet the future energy challenges of the world. And hence, leading industrial countries have taken initiatives to tap alternative energy sources mainly known as green or renewable energy sources. The bottom line of Kalam's speech indicates concern of mankind in 21 st century.\n\nMr. APJ Abdul Kalam was not only a scientist but also the President of India. At the 90 th 90^{\\text {th }} 9 0 th science congress, he (a)____ a speech on the aspect of mankind's future energy crisis. He (b)____ pressure on the (c) ____ of solar energy. (d) ____ to the history, the energy sources have always been a major factor of change. All the general people should have a (e) ____ about the fact.",
