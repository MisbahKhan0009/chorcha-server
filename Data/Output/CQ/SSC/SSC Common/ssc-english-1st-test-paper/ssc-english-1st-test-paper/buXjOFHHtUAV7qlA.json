          "explanation": "a. February 21 is a memorable day in our national history because on this day in 1952, the heroic son's of Bengal laid down their lives to establish Bangla as a state language of the undivided Pakistan. On this day, we pay tribute to the language martyrs because of their sacrifice for the rightful place of mother tongue.\nb. The then Governor General of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Zinnah, is responsible to raise a storm of protest. In a public meeting in Dhaka, he declared Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan, which disregarded the language rights of the Bangalee. Therefore, a mass protest started across the country.\nc. The Pakistani government banned all sorts of public meetings and gatherings to stop the protest that began following Mohammad Ali Jinnah's declaration of Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan and continued non-stop.\nd. Against the declaration of outlawing all sorts of public meeting and rallies, the students of Dhaka University brought out a peaceful protest procession on 21 February, defying the law.\ne. The Language Movement of 1952 kindled the sparks of independence movement in East Pakistan by making the Bangalees aware of their rights. Thus, the Language Movement is related to the independence movement of Bangladesh."

          "explanation": "Load shedding means the intentional and temporary suspension of electricity supply in a specific area when the demand for power exceeds the capacity of the national grid. It is a common problem in developing countries like Bangladesh. The primary causes of load shedding include a massive gap between the production and demand for electricity, system loss, illegal connections, and the shortage of fuel needed for power plants.\nIt hampers our daily life in numerous ways. Students cannot study properly at night, especially during exams. In hospitals, it affects critical surgeries and the operation of life-saving equipment. Furthermore, industrial production is severely disrupted, causing huge financial losses for the country. To solve this chronic problem, the government should take immediate steps to establish more power plants and upgrade the existing ones. Additionally, preventing illegal connections, reducing system loss, and encouraging the use of renewable energy like solar power can help minimize the crisis. Above all, we must be conscious and avoid wasting electricity in our daily lives."

          "explanation": "The Farmer and the Nobleman\n\nOnce upon a time, a poor farmer lived in a small village. Despite his hardships, he was known for his honesty and hardworking nature. One day, while plowing his field, he found a small pouch buried in the soil. Opening it, he discovered it was filled with gold coins. The farmer was astonished but quickly realized it must belong to someone in the village. He decided to find the owner.\nAfter much inquiry, the farmer learned the pouch belonged to a wealthy nobleman who had visited the village some time ago. Without hesitation, the farmer traveled to the nobleman’s mansion to return the treasure. The nobleman, surprised by the farmer’s honesty, asked, “You are poor. Why didn’t you keep the gold?” The farmer replied, “Honesty is more valuable than gold. I could not live with myself knowing I had taken what wasn’t mine.”\nThe nobleman was deeply moved by the farmer’s virtue. As a reward, he gifted the farmer a portion of the gold and a fertile piece of land. The farmer’s life changed for the better, but his honesty remained steadfast. The story of his integrity spread far and wide, teaching others the priceless value of honesty and righteousness."

Your parents treated me like their own son. Your elder sister is an amiable person. She entertained me much telling many stories and funny jokes. I wish I had an elder sister like yours.

          "explanation": "Noha: Hey Mahin! I was reading an article yesterday about how mobile phones affect teenagers. It got me thinking—do you think it's more helpful or harmful?\nMahin: Hey Noha! That’s actually a great topic. I think it’s a bit of both. Mobile phones are super helpful for staying connected and accessing information, but they also have their downsides.\nNoha: Totally agree. Like, one of the biggest merits is easy communication. We can call, text, or video chat with friends and family anytime.\nMahin: Yeah, and educational apps and online resources make studying easier too. We can watch tutorials, join online classes, and even do research quickly.\nNoha: Right. But on the flip side, many teens get addicted to social media and games. That really affects their studies and sleep.\nMahin: Exactly. And some even suffer from anxiety or low self-esteem because of comparing themselves to others on social media.\nNoha: Another issue is less face-to-face interaction. I feel like teens are losing social skills because they’re always on their phones.\nMahin: True. Plus, spending too much time staring at screens can cause eye problems and other health issues.\nNoha: But still, if we use mobile phones responsibly, they can be very useful. It’s all about balance, right?\nMahin: Definitely. Using phones wisely can make teenage life easier and more productive, but overuse can lead to serious problems.\nNoha: Well said, Mahin. I think every teen should know both sides before using a phone too much.\nMahin: For sure. Awareness is the first step to using technology in a healthy way"
