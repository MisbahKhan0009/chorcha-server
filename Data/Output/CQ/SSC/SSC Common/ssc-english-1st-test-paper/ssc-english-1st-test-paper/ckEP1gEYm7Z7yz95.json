      "uddipok": "The scarcity of food will be a serious problem. It is true that our agriculturists have developed new varieties of rice and its per acre production has definiely increased. But the rate of increase in food production cannot keep pace with the rate of population growth. This is because our land is fixed. Besides, families are growing larger in size and breaking into smaller families. Each such family needs a separate house to live in. Also the arable fields are being divided by these smaller families among themselves. Mills and factories are being set up, which occupy a considerable portion of our land. So when we need more land to grow more food to feed more mouths, our land is shrinking day by day. If our population grows at the present rate, a day will come when many people will not find any land to build a house on.\nFill in blanks with suitable word of your own based on the information of the text:\nPopulation growth causes a variety of problems.

A school library is only for the teachers and the students of a school. We have an up-to-date library in our school. It is housed in a separate one-storey building. It is quite spacious and well-ventilated. The books are arranged systemically in different bookshelves. So, we have no difficulty in finding out the expected books. Our school library has a good collection of text and reference books. It has also books on different branches of knowledge like literature, history, science, commerce, geography, travels, biography and so on. Besides, it has a good supply of newspapers, magazines and journals. Moreover, there is a librarian in charge of our school library. He is well-trained, qualified and experienced. Every student has a library card. We can borrow two books at a time. Nobody is allowed to keep a book for more than two weeks. In the library; discipline and silence is strictly maintained. While studying in the reading room, students are strictly prohibited to talk or disturb others in any way. The calm and quiet atmosphere of the library helps the students to work attentively. Our school library plays an important role in enriching both our academic and general knowledge. It provides us with the opportunity to read different types of books. To us, it is a storehouse of knowledge. I think, every educational institution should have a library. To conclude it can be said that no educational institute is a complete one without a library.\n"
