          "explanation": "Tree Plantation\nTree plantation means planting trees on a large scale in a planned way. Trees are our friends. They give us shade and soothe our eyes with their green colour. They give us various kinds of fruits. They give us firewood as fuel for cooking. They give us timber for furniture, doors and windows, boats, electric poles, railway slippers, etc. They give us rubber too. Trees take in carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. Sufficient trees cause sufficient rainfall and prevent draught. Trees along the roadside and coastal areas preyent erosion and tidal bore. But many inconsiderate pcople are cutting down trees for their selfish interests. So, we are losing trees. If there is no tree, there will be no civilization. In fact, the loss of trees will take our existence to the verge of extinction. The earth will be no more habitable. Hence, tree plantation must be taken as a project. The more we plant trees, the morė our environment will be balanced and greener. In Bangladesh, tree plantation is compulsory because we do not have as much forest as we require to maintain the ecological balance. There is no specific time to plant trees. We can plant trees any time of the year based on the type of the trees. Park, yard, urban areas, open field, balcony, rooftops; roadside places, etc. are best places to plant trees. To make life peaceful, there is no alternative to tree plantation."

          "explanation": "Escaping to Nature: A Boat Trip to Remember\n\nIn the last summer vacation, I was staying at my village home. Some of my friends proposed that we should go on a journey by boat. We fixed a date and a destination. We hired a boat for the day. We set out early in the morning and enjoyed the tranquil river, as the sunrise created a golden hue on the water. Along.the way, we were mesimerized by the breathtaking sights of small villages, children waving and shouting 'hello', fishermen casting their nets, and women washing clothes in the river. We felt grateful to experience it together and enjoy nature's offerings.\nAround 11 a.m., we arrived at our destination, a small island in the middle of the river covered in lush greenery. We spent the next few hours exploring the island walking on foot, swimming in the river, and enjoying a pleasant picnic with the packed lunch we brought with us. Eventually, we'set out for the return journey, which was equally enjoyable."

Everyone smokes, so it’s not a big deal.\nSabuj: I get that it feels calming, but have you considered how dangerous it is? Smoking can lead to serious problems like lung cancer, heart disease, and even strokes.\nSagor: Yeah, I’ve heard that, but it feels hard to quit. I’ve tried, but it’s tough.\nSabuj: I understand it’s hard, but think about your future. You’re still young—your lungs and heart are strong now, but smoking can damage them permanently over time. It shortens your life, too.\nSagor: I know it’s bad, but I can’t seem to stop. What do you suggest I do?\nSabuj: Maybe start by cutting down slowly. Try to replace cigarettes with healthier habits, like exercise or chewing gum. You could also talk to a doctor—they can help you with a plan to quit.\nSagor: I guess it’s worth a try. Thanks, Sabuj. I’ll think about it seriously.\nSabuj: I’m here to support you, Sagor. You’ve got this!"
