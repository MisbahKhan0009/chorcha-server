Last Sunday, I witnessed a tragic street accident. It took place near our school. There is a turning there. It is an interchange of five roads. Now and then, there occurs a traffic jam. On that day, while I was going to school, I saw a car coming from the western direction. A rickshaw, with a school boy and his mother, was coming from the opposite direction at about 8:30 a.m. While crossing the point, the car hit the rickshaw. The rickshawpuller was able to jump fróm his seat but the boy and his mother fell on the street. The boy and his mother were seriously wounded. I rushed to them. Some other passers-by also came forward to help them. We led them to a nearby doctor's chamber. I felt pity for the school boy, he was of my age. In fact, for having no traffic police at that place, such accidents frequently occur. The authority should take steps to stop road accidents that very often claim peoples' lives."

Moreover, he was fond of gold though he had a lot of it. He thought if he had the golden touch, he would be the happiest man. A wise God granted his wish promptly, One morning, he got up early and started walking around in his garden as usual and touched a white rose in the garden. Then he saw, to his utter surprise, that the flower had turned into a piece of white gold. He was amazed and touched another plant which, in an instant, turned into gold. It was really amusing to him. He started playing with his new found blessing. Right at this moment, his only daughter entered the garden. When he embraced his daughter to share his delight with her, to his sheer grief, he found her being turned into a statue of gold. He became very shocked at this and prayed to God to take back the destructive blessing. After few moments, the girl came to life. The king became happy.\n"

          "explanation": "The pie chart illustrates the percentage distribution of a family's household expenditure across various categories. According to the chart, the highest portion of the family’s income, 35%, is spent on food, which indicates the family's priority on meeting basic needs. Housing and education come next, each consuming 20% of the total budget, showing that the family values both shelter and education equally. Health accounts for 12% of the expenses, which reflects a moderate concern for medical needs. A smaller portion, 5%, is kept aside as savings, suggesting that while the family tries to save, it is not a major focus. The least amount, only 3%, is allocated for transport, implying either minimal travel or the availability of cost-effective transportation. Overall, the chart highlights the family’s priorities, with most of the income being spent on essential needs like food, housing, and education, while less is spent on transport and savings."

Water pollution is the pollution of bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, seas, the oceans, as well as groundwater. It occurs when pollutants move into it.\nKajal : How do pollutants move into water?\nRajiya : Well, it is we who are responsible for it. We haphazardly throw waste and filth into water and pollute it. Farmers using chemical fertilizers and insecticides in the field also run towards water bodies when it rains. It also causes water pollution.\nKajal : I see. Any other reasons?\nRajiya : Yes, throwing oil, food waste, and human waste into the rivers causes water pollution. Besides, insanitary latrines on the banks of the rivers and canals and drains running into the rivers and canals make water polluted.\nKajal : Oh my God! That's terrible. I wish it did not happen.\nRajiya : But we can prevent water pollution by creating mass awareness among people.\nKajal : By the way, what are the effects of water pollution?\nRajiya : Its effects are many. When we drink polluted water or use it for household purposes, we may get affected by waterborne diseases like typhoid, cholera or by any other chronic diseases. Besides, water pollution is harmful for our environment.\nKajal : We have to stop water pollution. - Otherwise, it will cause us great harm. Anyway, thank you for the discussion.\nRajiya : You're welcome."
