In Bangladesh poisonous exhausts from industrial plants, brick kilns, old or poorly serviced vehicles and dust from roads and construction sites are some of the major sources of air pollution. We can minimise this type of pollution by making less use of motor vehicles and avoiding the use of vehicles older than 20 years. We may also use proper lubricants to lessen the level of emission and pollutants. We can encourage people to use Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) or Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) for fuelling their cars. The government may relocate hazardous industries like brick kilns to areas away from human habitations.\n.\nAir is the most important element of human environment.

      "uddipok": "It was late summer, 26 August 1910. A little girl was born to a rich Catholic merchants' family of Albanian descent in a small town called Skopje, Macedonia. She was the youngest of the three siblings and was named Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu. Who could imagine at the time that this little girl would one day become the mother of humanity, loving and serving the poorest of the poor. Yes, we are talking about none other than Mother Teresa.\n\nAt the age of 12, she heard a voice from within that urged her to spread the love of Christ. She decided that she would be a missionary. At the age of 18 , she left her parental home. She then joined an Irish community of nuns called the Sisters of Loreto, which had missions in India.\n\nAfter a few months of training at the Institute of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Dublin, Mother Teresa came to India. On May 24, 1931, she took her initial vows as a nun. From 1931 to 1948, Mother Teresa taught geography and theology at St. Mary's High School in Kolkata (then Calcutta). However, the widespread poverty in Kolkata had a deep impact on Mother Teresa and in 1948, she received permission from her superiors to leave the convent and devote herself to caring for the poorest of the poor in the slums of Kolkata.\n\nFor the contribution to humanity, she was awarded the Noble Peace Prize in 1979. She died at the age of 87 , on 5 September, 1997.\nWrite a summary of the above passage in your own words.",

          "explanation": "Our School Library\n\nA library is the place where various kinds of books, newspapers, magazines, etc, are kept for readers. A school library is only for the teachers and the students of a school. We have an up-to-date library in our school. It is housed in a separate one-storey building. It is quite spacious and well-ventilated. The books are arranged systemically in different bookshelves. So, we have no difficulty in finding out the expected books. Our school library has a good collection of text and reference books. It has also books on different branches of knowledge like literature, history, science, commerce, geography, travels, biography and so on. Besides, it has a good supply of newspapers, magazines and journals. Moreover, there is a librarian in charge of our school library. He is well-trained, qualified and experienced. Every student has a library card. We can borrow two books at a time. Nobody is allowed to keep a book for more than two weeks. In the library; discipline and silence is strictly maintained. While studying in the reading room, students are strictly prohibited to talk or disturb others in any way. The calm and quiet atmosphere of the library helps the students to work attentively. Our school library plays an important role in enriching both our academic and general knowledge. It provides us with the opportunity to read different types of books. To us, it is a storehouse of knowledge. I think, every educational institution should have a library. To conclude it can be said that no educational institute is a complete one without a library.\n"

But now, I am missing your company as well as your family members. Indeed, I had a very nice time with you and your family. You took much trouble for me. You accompanied me visiting different historic places of the city. I was very delighted to acquire knowledge about those attractive places. Again, I can't but remember the hospitality your family offered me. All of your family members behaved with me very well. It seemed that I was like a member of your family. Your parents treated me like their own son. Your elder sister is an amiable person. She entertained me much telling many stories and funny jokes. I wish I had an elder sister like yours. However, I must thank all of you for your hospitality and entertainment.\nLet me know when you will visit our house. No more today. Convey my best regards to your parents and Ranu Apa and affection to the younger ones.\nYours ever,\nMahmud"

You know, I was reading about the importance of tree plantation recently. It really made me think about how much we depend on trees for our environment.\nRifa : Oh, that’s interesting! What exactly did you read about? I’ve heard tree plantation is important, but I don’t know much about it.\nEbad : Well, trees help in many ways. They absorb carbon dioxide, give us oxygen, prevent soil erosion, and even provide shade. Planting more trees can help fight climate change and make our surroundings healthier.\nRifa : That’s true. I’ve also noticed how many trees have been cut down in our area for construction. The environment is getting worse because of that.\nEbad : Yes, exactly. That’s why tree plantation is so important. It’s not just about planting trees, but also about raising awareness and protecting the ones we already have. We could start a small tree plantation drive in our neighborhood. What do you think?\nRifa : I love the idea! We can plant trees around schools, parks, and even along roadsides. Maybe we could ask others to join us, too.\nEbad : Absolutely! If we get more people involved, it will make a bigger impact. We could also share information about how to take care of the plants after they are planted, so they grow strong.\nRifa : That’s a great plan! Let’s get started soon. I’m sure it will make a difference in our community.\nEbad : Yes, it will. Together, we can help make our environment greener and cleaner!\nRifa : I’m excited! Let’s begin planning right away!\nEbad : Alright, I’ll gather some information and we can meet tomorrow to discuss it further. Thanks for being so enthusiastic, Rifa!\nRifa : Of course, Ebad! I’m happy to help. See you tomorrow!"
