          "explanation": "A Rainy Day\nA rainy day is dull and gloomy. Sometimes, it drizzles and sometimes, it rains heavily all day long. The sky remains overcast with black clouds. The sun is hardly visible. Gusty wind blows from all sides. Birds keep standing on branches of trees or keep quiet in their nests. Cattle remain in their sheds and bellow for the fodder. Water stands here and there. Unpitched roads become muddy and slippery. Passers-by have to walk with umbrella over their head, shoes in hand and pants folded up to the knee. Sometimes people slip and fall on the muddy road. In cities, a rainy day is now a horror. The roads and streets in some towns and cities get flooded. Vehicles are seen stranding in knee-deep water in some areas due to water clogging. It causes gridlock across the city. It is a day of trouble and annoyance to the office-going people. They have to suffer from yarious inconveniences. But for the school going children, it is a delight to have a rainy day. If it rains heavily before their school time, they get a holiday. Sometimes, children, especially the boys play football in the rainwater in the nearby fields. A rainy day is a curse for the poor. The day labourers cannot go out for work and hence, they have to suffer a lot. However, I pass the day by listening to music, watching TV or reading journals. In short, a rainy day is a day of both pleasure and pain."

Moreover, he was fond of gold though he had a lot of it. He thought if he had the golden touch, he would be the happiest man. A wise God granted his wish promptly, One morning, he got up early and started walking around in his garden as usual and touched a white rose in the garden. Then he saw, to his utter surprise, that the flower had turned into a piece of white gold. He was amazed and touched another plant which, in an instant, turned into gold. It was really amusing to him. He started playing with his new found blessing. Right at this moment, his only daughter entered the garden. When he embraced his daughter to share his delight with her, to his sheer grief, he found her being turned into a statue of gold. He became very shocked at this and prayed to God to take back the destructive blessing. After few moments, the girl came to life. The king became happy.\n"

          "explanation": "The pie chart shows the subject preferences of students in a secondary school. It highlights their interest in four key subjects: Mathematics, Science, Bangla, and English. According to the chart, Mathematics is the most preferred subject, with 35% of the students showing interest in it. This is followed by Science, which attracts 25% of the students. Bangla is also popular, drawing the attention of 23% of the students. English, however, is the least chosen subject, with only 17% showing interest in it.\nFrom the data, it is clear that students tend to favor subjects related to logic and reasoning, such as Mathematics and Science, over languages. This could be due to the growing importance of science and technology in modern education and career paths. Nonetheless, the significant interest in Bangla reflects a continued appreciation for the mother tongue. Overall, the chart shows a balanced but slightly science-leaning academic interest among students."

Today I am writing to you about it:'\nEvery year, our teachers organize a day full of activities to commemorate the martyrs and celebrate our language, culture and history. This year was not different. With the national flag hoisted half-mast, we began our day by placing flowers at the Shaheed Minar in our school. After paying tributes, we attended the rally holding various placards and then marched around the town. Back in school, the authorities had arranged a cultural program where students sang different songs dedicated to the day, some recited poems and teachers gave a brief speech on the significance of 21 3 t 21^{3 t} 2 1 3 t February. Around noon, there was an art competition for the students and I participated with my classmates even though I do not know how to draw.\nNo more today. Tell me how you celebrated your 21 ∗ 21^{\\mathbb{*}} 2 1 ∗ February this year. Warm regards to your parents.\n\nYour friend,\nSabina Yasmin"

We all should use mosquito repellents for that, shouldn't we?\n\nRobin: Yes, we should. But we have to reduce the mosquito population first.\n\nFardin: Righṭ! We can do that by destroying their breeding places. Am I right?\n\nRobin : You're absolutely right! For that, we should keep our dwelling places neat and clean. No stagnant water should be allowed in and around our,houses.\n\nFardin: Besides, we need to use mosquito nets while sleeping. By the way, what should the infected people do to be recovered?\n\nRobin : It's true that there is no direct cure for dengue. However, doctors generally suggest the infected people to take rest and drink plenty of liquids. Some medicines like paracitamol, supplements are also prescribed.\n\nFardin: I see. Let's discuss the matter with our friends and start our work against the Aedes mosquitoes.\n\nRobin: Let's go."
