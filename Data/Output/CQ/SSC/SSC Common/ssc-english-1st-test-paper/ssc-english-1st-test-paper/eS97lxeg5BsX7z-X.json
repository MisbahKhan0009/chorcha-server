          "explanation": "a. February 21 is a memorable day in our national history because on this day in 1952, the heroic son's of Bengal laid down their lives to establish Bangla as a state language of the undivided Pakistan. On this day, we pay tribute to the language martyrs because of their sacrifice for the rightful place of mother tongue.\nb. The then Governor General of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Zinnah, is responsible to raise a storm of protest. In a public meeting in Dhaka, he declared Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan, which disregarded the language rights of the Bangalee. Therefore, a mass protest started across the country.\nc. The Pakistani government banned all sorts of public meetings and gatherings to stop the protest that began following Mohammad Ali Jinnah's declaration of Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan and continued non-stop.\nd. Against the declaration of outlawing all sorts of public meeting and rallies, the students of Dhaka University brought out a peaceful protest procession on 21 February, defying the law.\ne. The Language Movement of 1952 kindled the sparks of independence movement in East Pakistan by making the Bangalees aware of their rights. Thus, the Language Movement is related to the independence movement of Bangladesh."

      "uddipok": "Rabindranath Tagore was one of the most leading poets in the history of world literature. He was at the same time a poet, a novelist, a dramatist, a philosopher and a musician. He was born in the renowned Tagore family on 7May, 1861. After the completion of his house education, he was sent to school. But he did not like institutional education. So, arrangements were made at house for his proper education. In his thirteenth year, Rabindranath along with his father went to visit Himalayas. At the age of seventeen, he was sent to London to study law. But he studied literature with Professor Henry Morley only for a few months and then returned home. Only at the age of eight, he started composing poems. He wrote his poetic novel Banaphul at the age of fifteen. When he was sixteen, his poems and essays were being published in journals. After returning from England, he began to write tirelessly in all branches of literature. In 1911, he translated his poems of \"The Gitanjali\" into English which brought him the highest honour in the form of the Nobel Prize in 1913.\nOne year after his awarding of the Nobel Prize, he was made a knight by the British Government which he rejected as a protest against the atrocities of British Government at Jalianwalabagh. The University of Oxford honoured him with D.Litt., in 1940. Earlier in 1921, he laid the foundation of Viswa Bharati. At the age of eighty, Rabindranath Tagore breathed his last.\n\nWrite a summary of the above passage in your own words.",

School life did not attract him much, and so, he was educated at home. However, at 17, he was sent to London to study Law. But he started to study Literature there. Rabindranath started to show his poetic talent very early in his life. In 1911, he translated his poems of 'The Gitanjali' into English for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1913. In 1914, he was made a knight, by the British Government, but he rejected it as a protest against the British atrocities. Rabindranath was also honoured with D.Litt. by Oxford University.

          "explanation": "A Winter Morning\nA winter morning has its own exceptional natural aspects as well as its effects on human and animal life. A winter morning is misty and cold. There is dense fog everywhere. Sometimes, the fog is so dense that the sun-rays cannot get through it. Everything looks hazy. The scenery of a winter morning is really charming in rural areas. Dewdrops on grass and leaves sparkle like pearls in the sunrays. Generally, people wake up late in the morning. They shiver in cold. They wear warm clothes. Old people and children are found basking in the morning sun. People usually have date juice and various native 'pithas' as breakfast. Cattle remain in their sheds. However, in cities, a winter morning does not make much change in life as it is not too cold there. People wake up at their usual time, wear colourful warm clothes and go to their work place. Students are seen in the most colourful warm clothes. The nature is dull and gloomy here, too. Both in rural and urban areas, poor people are the worst sufferers. They do not have enough warm clothes to protect themselves from the biting cold. Street children gather straw and papers and make fire to warm themselves. The communication system is disrupted which causes much hardship to the people. However, the scenery of a winter morning is very transitory. It starts disappearing as the day advances. My personal feeling about a winter morning is that it is a bane for the poor, but a boon for the rich."

          "explanation": "The Boy Who Saved the Train\n\nOne sunny morning a boy of eleven years old was tending cattle by the side of a railway line. Suddenly he noticed a small railway slipper which was about to collapse. A little while later, he remembered that a mail train was supposed to cross in about half an hour. He thought that something should be done. Otherwise a serious accident might occur. He was thinking what to do: He was looking here and there but found none. Suddenly he remembered that if he showed red signal, the train might stop. As he was wearing a red shirt, at once he took oft his shirt and hung it with a stick. Then he began to wave it in the air. The driver saw it from far away and stopped the train slowly. He came to the boy and asked what happened. The boy took him to the railway slipper. Seeing it the driver thanked him and said that he had saved them. The next day the news was published in different newspapers. The government and many institutions awarded him for his ready wit."

It is praiseworthy that you're going well with your study. At the same time, I want to give you an advice to take physical exercise regularly. You know that \"A sound mind remains in a sound body.\" So, to keep your body fit, you should take physical exercise daily. You are already suffering from leg pain. Still you are not taking any sort of physical exercise. If you avoid doing exercise on a regular basis, your body will get rusty. You will feel uneasy all the times. Without soundness in your body, you will be inattentive to your study. But you should become careful of the rules of exercise. Otherwise, it may hamper your health. You must have a proper guideline for this. I think, you will inform me your details soon.\nHow're our parents? Convey my best wishes to Tuhin and Shaon. No more today.\n\nYour elder sister,\nRubina"

          "explanation": "Noha: Hey Mahin! I was reading an article yesterday about how mobile phones affect teenagers. It got me thinking—do you think it's more helpful or harmful?\nMahin: Hey Noha! That’s actually a great topic. I think it’s a bit of both. Mobile phones are super helpful for staying connected and accessing information, but they also have their downsides.\nNoha: Totally agree. Like, one of the biggest merits is easy communication. We can call, text, or video chat with friends and family anytime.\nMahin: Yeah, and educational apps and online resources make studying easier too. We can watch tutorials, join online classes, and even do research quickly.\nNoha: Right. But on the flip side, many teens get addicted to social media and games. That really affects their studies and sleep.\nMahin: Exactly. And some even suffer from anxiety or low self-esteem because of comparing themselves to others on social media.\nNoha: Another issue is less face-to-face interaction. I feel like teens are losing social skills because they’re always on their phones.\nMahin: True. Plus, spending too much time staring at screens can cause eye problems and other health issues.\nNoha: But still, if we use mobile phones responsibly, they can be very useful. It’s all about balance, right?\nMahin: Definitely. Using phones wisely can make teenage life easier and more productive, but overuse can lead to serious problems.\nNoha: Well said, Mahin. I think every teen should know both sides before using a phone too much.\nMahin: For sure. Awareness is the first step to using technology in a healthy way"

      "uddipok": "Mother Teresa was moved by the sight of the sick and dying on the streets of Kolkata. She founded a home for the dying destitute and named it \"Nirmal Hriday\", meaning \"Pure Heart\". She and her fellow nuns gathered the dying people of the streets of Kolkata and brought them to this home. They were lovingly looked after and cared for. Since then men, women and children have been taken from the streets and carried to Nirmal Hriday. These unloved and uncared for people get an opportunity to die in an environment of kindness and love. In their last hours they get human and divine love, and can feel they are also children of God. Those who survive, the Missionaries of Charity try to find jobs for them or send them to homes where they can live happily for some more years in a caring environment. Regarding commitment to family, Mother Teresa said, \"May be in our own family, we have somebody, who is feeling lonely, who is feeling sick, who is feeling worried, are we there? Are we willing to give until it hurts in order to be with our families, or do we put our interest first? We must remember that love begins at home and we must also remember that future of humanity passes through the family.\" Mother Teresa's work has been recognised thought the world and she has received a number of awards. These include the Pope John XXIII Peace Prize (1971), the Nehru Prize for Promotion of International Peace and Understanding (1972), the Balzan Prize (1978), the Nobel Peace Prize (1979) and the Bharat Ratna, (1980). Mother Teresa died at the age of 87, on 5 September 1997. The world salutes her for her love and compassion for humanity.
