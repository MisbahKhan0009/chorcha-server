They urged the workers to stand together, to go on with their struggle and not to give in to their bosses. At one point of the rally, some strikebreakers started leaving the meeting place. The strikers went down the street to bring them back. Suddenly, about 200 policemen attacked them with clubs and revolvers.

          "explanation": "Pollution refers to the contamination of something that makes it harmful for human health and unsuitable to be used. Water pollution means making water harmful and contaminated by throwing waste, filth, etc. into it. Water is called life as the life of both animals and plants is impossible without water. But it is being polluted day by day for many reasons. The main reason for water pollution is the irresponsibility of human beings. People throw waste into water and pollute it. Ships throw oil, human wastes and other wastes into rivers and sea water which causes water pollution. Farmers use chemical fertilizers and insecticides in their fields that mix up with rainwater and flow down into rivers. and canals and cause water pollution. Besides, some people use insanitary latrines by rivers, canals or\ndrains which greatly pollute water. By drinking polluted water people become ill. Fishes die in polluted water and even farming becomes impossible in severely polluted water. It is a threat to our natural environment. People can stop water pollution by being of it. Farmers should use natural or green fertilizers in their fields. People should use\nsanitary latrines. Ship owners should be careful to build the bottom layer of their ships properly to stop oil sipping. Thus we can save water from pollution."

The eldest grew very rich, but at the same time cruel and wicked, whereas there was nowhere a more honest and kinder man than the younger. One day, the younger brother, Alif found himself in a helpless situation when he had neither food nor wood in his house.\nHe set off in search of food for his wife and children. After walking a long way, Alif witnessed Faruq attacking an old man who had merely asked for help with his heavy bag. Alif immediately stepped in, rescued the old man, and carried the bag for him. On their way, Alif shared how Faruq took away entire of their father's property and made Alif helpless. Being curious about the bag's contents, Alif then asked the old man, \"What's there in the bag, uncle?\" The old man replied, \"I'm going to shift near the forest. So, I'm carrying all my precious things there including gold.\" Aftet reaching the destination, the old man went inside and returned with food and some gold coins. He presented them to Alif as a token of gratitude. Alif was shocked but accepted the gift humbly. Using the gold, he started providing the necessities of his family.\nNoticing Alif's sudden change in fortune, Faruq became suspicious. He hurried to Alif's cottage the next day and threatened him to confess how he had obtained the money. Alif explained the truth about the old mian's gift.\nDriven by greed, Faruq decided to go to the old man to claim all the gold for himself. Reaching old man's house, Faruq said, \"Give me all your possessions, old weak creature!\" The old man got afraid. In a trembling voice, he refused to give anything and tried to get Faruk out of his home. Howeyer, Faruk was so desperate that he went out of his mind and killed the old man to seize the gold. Being able to get all the precious things, Faruq was going back home happily. However, on his way back, a group of robbers noticed Faruq. They killed him and took away his bag containing gold.\nMoral: Greed is the root of all evil."

In 2010, with a happy note, the literacy rate went up to 56.8 percent. It was the result of hard work of the previous seven years. So, it can be said that within the period of 15 years, there is a great achievement in education sector. In this period of time, the literacy rate has increased a lot."

He was an active worker of the Language Movement. He was one of the ten students to go out in a procession on 21 . February 1952 despite a ban on such activities imposed by the authorities. As a result, he and many others were arrested and taken to prison. Zahir was also present at the historical meeting of Amtala on 21 February 1952. He also took part in the mass movement in 1969. In 1971, he joined the Liberation War.\nAll through his life, Zahir Raihan dreamt of a democratic society, a society that will ensure freedom of speech and will. He had many dreams about our film industry too. He made a legendary film 'Jibon Theke Neya' based on the Language Movement of 1952. It was a revolt against the autocratic government. The family presented in that film was a miniature East Pakistan ruled by an autocrat who had to go to prison for her conspiracy. During the Liberation War, this film was shown outside Bangladesh. Celebrated filmmakers like Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, and Ritwik Ghatak appreciated the film. Zahir gave all the money to the Freedom Fighters' trust that he get from his film shows. Besides, his great documentary on Pakistani atrocities, 'Stop Genocide', helped create world sentiment in favour of our liberation war.\nOn 30 December 1971, someone informed Zahir about an address somewhere at Mirpur, where he might find his brother, the famous writer Shahidullah Kaiser. Shahidullah was captured and killed by the Pakistani army and the local collaborators during the last days of the war. Accordingly, Zahir left home to get his brother back but he never returned. Zahir's dream was fulfilled. He could see the inception of a free independent Bangladesh though he did not get back his brother. And it's a pity that this dreamer was missing at such a time when his dream came true.",
