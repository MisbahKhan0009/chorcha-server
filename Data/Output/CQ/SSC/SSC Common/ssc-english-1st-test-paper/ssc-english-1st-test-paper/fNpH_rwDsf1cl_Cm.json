But they can control the increase in the amount of greenhouse gases and its effect on the atmosphere. Only during the last hundred years the carbon dioxide concentration has been raised alarmingly in the atmosphere and we humans can be held responsible for this.\nThe main cause of the increase in carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels. Since the end of the 19th century, industrial activities increased rapidly giving rise to many factories. These factories required energy, which was produced through the combustion of coal. Besides coal, other sources of energy such as mineral oil and natural gas were also burned to heat our houses, run cars and airplanes or to produce electricity. Nowadays, about 85 million barrels of crude oil are burned daily. Every time a fossil raw material is burned, it releases.carbon dioxide into the air.\nTherefore, it is clear that more and more greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide are being generated worldwide by humans. Moreover, we are also strengthening the greenhouse effect by deforestation, which means cutting down trees. Every year enormous areas of forests are destroyed by people to obtain wood and to clear regions for mining and to create pasture. This loss of the forest causes dual problems. Trees that are burned up release large volumes of carbon dioxide gas into the air. On the other hand, as forest absorb a lot of carbon dioxide from the air and deliver oxygen instead, we also destroy an important storehouse of carbon dioxide when we clear forests.\nChoose the correct answer from the alternatives:",

          "explanation": "Environment Pollution\nThe surroundings in which a person, animal or plant lives is called environment. There are many elements in our environment. Air, water, soil, plants, animals, etc. are such elements. They are essential for the environment as well as human beings. These elements should be sound for our sound living. But when they are polluted and their essential balance is disrupted, this phenomenon is known as environmental pollution. Nowadays, almost everywhere, the environment is being seriously polluted. In many places of our country, the environment has become extremely polluted. Actually, we ourselves are responsible for this severe pollution. Industries and factories emit huge amount of smoke, gases and fume. Motor vehicles also emit large amount of smoke and gases. All these pollute air seriously and polluted air is very harmful for us. Moreover, water is polluted due to dumping of industrial wastes and by chemical fertilizers and insecticides which are washed away into rivers and canals. Due to indiscriminate use of vehicle horns, loud speakers, mikes, etc. sound is polluted. Soil is polluted by harmful chemical fertilizers and insecticides. Besides, people are cutting down trees at random. All these are causing environmental pollution. Consequently, man becomes sick, animals and fishes are getting reduced, global warming is increasing, polar icecaps are melting, frequent floods are occurring and so on. So, we all should be aware of this harmful pollution and take effective measures to solve it."

Suddenly his mother woke up and told him to give her a glass of water. But he found that there was no water in the house.\n\nWithout any hesitation, Bayazid took the water pot and went out in search of water. It was a dark and cold night, and everyone was asleep. He walked a long distance to the nearest well. After collecting the water, he hurried back home. But when he reached home, he saw that his mother had fallen asleep again.\n\nBayazid did not want to wake her up. So, he stood beside her bed with the glass of water in his hand. He remained standing the whole night, waiting patiently for his mother to wake up. When his mother opened her eyes in the morning, she was surprised to see Bayazid standing with the glass of water. Tears came to her eyes, and she hugged her son with love.\n\nBayazid’s deep love and respect for his mother made him a great man later in life. His story continues to inspire children to honor and care for their pa\nrents."

          "explanation": "Here is a sample paragraph based on the pie chart you provided:\nThe pie-chart shows the major export sectors in Bangladesh that earn foreign currency. Among them, the Ready-made Garments (RMG) sector is the most dominant, contributing the highest portion with 60% of total export earnings. This indicates that the garment industry plays a crucial role in Bangladesh's economy. The second largest sector is jute and jute goods, making up 10% of the exports. Following this, frozen food, such as shrimp and fish, accounts for 8%. Other export sectors include leather and leather products (6%), agricultural products (5%), and pharmaceuticals (4%). Handicrafts, tea, and others contribute smaller portions of 3%, 2%, and 2% respectively. The chart clearly highlights that while a few sectors contribute significantly, the economy heavily relies on garments. To reduce dependency on a single sector, Bangladesh should diversify its export products and focus on developing other potential industries for sustainable economic growth.\n\n\n\n"

What can I do?\n\nAhnaf: You can use a dictionary to look up unfamiliar words, or you can use apps on your phone to translate words quickly. Also, try reading aloud.

But the more you practice, the more confident you’ll get. We can practice together. Just try speaking with me, and I’ll help you if you make any mistakes.\n\nMohon: Thanks, Ahnaf! I’m still a bit scared, but I’ll try to speak more. What else can I do?\n\nAhnaf: Another tip is to listen to English podcasts or songs. Pay attention to how they speak. You’ll pick up a lot of new words and improve your listening skills.\n\nMohon: That sounds fun! I’ll start listening to English songs and try speaking more.\n\nAhnaf: Great! And don’t stress about making mistakes. That’s how you learn. Just keep practicing, and you’ll improve for sure.\n\nMohon: Thanks, Ahnaf. I feel better now!
