Then answer the questions below.\nLoneliness is a universal emotion that most of us experience at least once during our lifetime, although certain events, such as an illness or a pandemic, can make it feel more pervasive. If you're currently experiencing feelings of loneliness, you aren't alone. In fact, a 2020 study by Cigna found that 61% of Americans reported being lonely in 2019, up from 54% in 2018. No matter what events are occurring around you, understanding- loneliness and its risks is important for recognizing when you may need support. Read on to learn what loneliness is, its causes, long-term risks and ways to cope with the emotions that may come up when you're lonely.\nWhat Is Loneliness?\nThe American Psychological Association (APA) defines loneliness as the \"affective and cognitive discomfort or uneasiness from being or perceiving oneself to be alone or being or perceiving to be or otherwise solitary.\" In other words, loneliness is the mental or emotional discomfort you may experience from either being alone or feeling as though you are alone. This feeling stems from your social needs not being met and/or an inability to get the social connection you desire.\nLoneliness vs Being Alone\nAlthough loneliness and being alone are commonly confused, being alone doesn't necessarily mean someone is lonely. \"Loneliness is a feeling, while being alone is a situation or state of being, which is not inherently negative,\" says Nina Vasan, M.D., psychiatrist and professor at Stanford University School of Medicine and chief medical officer at Real, an online mental wellness membership site. \"You can feel lonely even when you're surrounded by other people - such as a partner, family, co-workers or friends,\" continues Dr. Vasan. It's also possible to be alone, but not feel lonely, she adds. \"For example, if you're by yourself but connecting to others through good communication or activities like volunteering, you don't feel lonely.\"\nChoose the correct answer from the following alternatives.",
