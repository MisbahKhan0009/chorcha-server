          "explanation": "a. February 21 is a memorable day in our national history because on this day in 1952, the heroic son's of Bengal laid down their lives to establish Bangla as a state language of the undivided Pakistan. On this day, we pay tribute to the language martyrs because of their sacrifice for the rightful place of mother tongue.\nb. The then Governor General of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Zinnah, is responsible to raise a storm of protest. In a public meeting in Dhaka, he declared Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan, which disregarded the language rights of the Bangalee. Therefore, a mass protest started across the country.\nc. The Pakistani government banned all sorts of public meetings and gatherings to stop the protest that began following Mohammad Ali Jinnah's declaration of Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan and continued non-stop.\nd. Against the declaration of outlawing all sorts of public meeting and rallies, the students of Dhaka University brought out a peaceful protest procession on 21 February, defying the law.\ne. The Language Movement of 1952 kindled the sparks of independence movement in East Pakistan by making the Bangalees aware of their rights. Thus, the Language Movement is related to the independence movement of Bangladesh."

          "explanation": "Deforestation\nDeforestation refers to the cutting and burning down of forests at random. It is just the opposite of the concept of tree plantation. In a word, it is the destruction of trees and plants in our environment. It has many adverse effects on our environment and oưr life. It destroys the ecological balance of our environment and our life. Due to deforestation, many species of birds and animals have already been extinct and many of them are faced with the threat of extinction. Because of deforestation, it does not rain adequately and this causes long-term drought. This drought may turn the whole country into a desert. Apart from this, deforestation also hampers our agricultural production. In fact, our environment is going to be uninhabitable for deforestation. However, there is a way to save ourselves and our environment from it and that is, we should start a mass campaign for tree plantation. For this, we should raise awareness among the mass people about the adverse sides of deforestation as well as about the importance of tree plantation. My suggestion, in this regard, is that we should plant at least one tree every month and if we cut one; we should plant three. I think. each man or woman, old or young should come forward and plant at least one tree to save our existence."

But one day, while cutting wood, his axe slipped from his hand and fell into a deep river nearby. The woodcutter became very sad because it was the only axe he had, and he could not afford a new one.\nHe sat on the riverbank and started crying. Suddenly, a kind fairy appeared from the water and asked him why he was crying. The woodcutter told her everything. The fairy dived into the river and came up with a golden axe . “Is this yours?” she asked. The woodcutter said, “No, this is not mine.”\nThen she brought a silver axe and asked the same question. Again, the woodcutter replied, “No, that’s not mine either.” Finally, she brought his old iron axe , and he happily said, “Yes! That one is mine!”\nThe fairy was very pleased with his honesty and gave him all three axes as a reward. The woodcutter went home joyfully and lived happily ever after. His honesty brought him unexpected blessings."

In your last letter you wanted to know about the co-curricular activities in my school.\nYou know that I am lucky to study in such a big and famous school which offers us facilities to learn a lot of things besides studies. We can depend on our teachers not only for study matters but also for matters related to our interests. Some of them run different clubs in school. The clubs are places where one can go and pursue his or her hobby. I'm a member of the debating club. We practise debating within the club and arrange debating competitions among different classes and among other schools as well. Our English teacher who runs this club, not only guides us in writing good speeches but also shows us how to present them. 'Our school arranges essay competitions and book reading competitions. Moreover, my school offers a wide range of extra-curricular activities for the students. The school has a musical group and a lot of dramas are played by the students. Besides, the students enjoy hockey and football as extra-curricular activities. Teachers consult with the students at personal level and encourage them to work more and more. The students of this school learn not only for examinations but also for life. In short, I can tell you studying in this school is a great experience. Along with the regular study, we can develop our extracurricular abilities as well.\nI guess, you are planning to shift to a new school.

That’s actually a great topic. I think it’s a bit of both. Mobile phones are super helpful for staying connected and accessing information, but they also have their downsides.\nNoha: Totally agree. Like, one of the biggest merits is easy communication. We can call, text, or video chat with friends and family anytime.\nMahin: Yeah, and educational apps and online resources make studying easier too. We can watch tutorials, join online classes, and even do research quickly.\nNoha: Right. But on the flip side, many teens get addicted to social media and games. That really affects their studies and sleep.\nMahin: Exactly. And some even suffer from anxiety or low self-esteem because of comparing themselves to others on social media.\nNoha: Another issue is less face-to-face interaction. I feel like teens are losing social skills because they’re always on their phones.\nMahin: True. Plus, spending too much time staring at screens can cause eye problems and other health issues.\nNoha: But still, if we use mobile phones responsibly, they can be very useful. It’s all about balance, right?\nMahin: Definitely. Using phones wisely can make teenage life easier and more productive, but overuse can lead to serious problems.\nNoha: Well said, Mahin. I think every teen should know both sides before using a phone too much.\nMahin: For sure. Awareness is the first step to using technology in a healthy way"

      "uddipok": "Mother Teresa was moved by the sight of the sick and dying on the streets of Kolkata. She founded a home for the dying destitute and named it \"Nirmal Hriday\", meaning \"Pure Heart\". She and her fellow nuns gathered the dying people of the streets of Kolkata and brought them to this home. They were lovingly looked after and cared for. Since then men, women and children have been taken from the streets and carried to Nirmal Hriday. These unloved and uncared for people get an opportunity to die in an environment of kindness and love. In their last hours they get human and divine love, and can feel they are also children of God. Those who survive, the Missionaries of Charity try to find jobs for them or send them to homes where they can live happily for some more years in a caring environment. Regarding commitment to family, Mother Teresa said, \"May be in our own family, we have somebody, who is feeling lonely, who is feeling sick, who is feeling worried, are we there? Are we willing to give until it hurts in order to be with our families, or do we put our interest first? We must remember that love begins at home and we must also remember that future of humanity passes through the family.\" Mother Teresa's work has been recognised thought the world and she has received a number of awards. These include the Pope John XXIII Peace Prize (1971), the Nehru Prize for Promotion of International Peace and Understanding (1972), the Balzan Prize (1978), the Nobel Peace Prize (1979) and the Bharat Ratna, (1980).
