      "uddipok": "Milton was a great poet after Shakespeare. His father early decided that Milton was to have a literary career. At the age of 7, in 1615 he got himself admitted in Star Palace School. But Milton could not pay attention to his studies in this school. After a couple of years, he left the school and studied at St. Paul's School till 1624. In the succeeding year, John Milton entered Christ College in Cambridge. He took his M.A degree at the age of 24 and went to his father's house in the village of Horton. Milton's father, however, had faith in his son and allowed him to continue his studies at Horton from 1632 to 1638 . During his time, he made himself master of everything worth knowing in the literature of Rome, Greece, Italy, France, Spain and the Bible. In 1643, Milton met Mary Powel in a occasion and married her. But this great poet became blind in 1652. The idea behind his famous work 'Paradise Lost' developed after his blindness. 'Paradise Lost' saw the light of the day in the year 1665. Nine years after its publications, this great artist in literature died.\nWrite a summary of the above passage in your own words.",

          "explanation": "Tree Plantation\nTree plantation means planting trees on a large scale in a planned way. Trees are our friends. They give us shade and soothe our eyes with their green colour. They give us various kinds of fruits. They give us firewood as fuel for cooking. They give us timber for furniture, doors and windows, boats, electric poles, railway slippers, etc. They give us rubber too. Trees take in carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. Sufficient trees cause sufficient rainfall and prevent draught. Trees along the roadside and coastal areas preyent erosion and tidal bore. But many inconsiderate pcople are cutting down trees for their selfish interests. So, we are losing trees. If there is no tree, there will be no civilization. In fact, the loss of trees will take our existence to the verge of extinction. The earth will be no more habitable. Hence, tree plantation must be taken as a project. The more we plant trees, the morė our environment will be balanced and greener. In Bangladesh, tree plantation is compulsory because we do not have as much forest as we require to maintain the ecological balance. There is no specific time to plant trees. We can plant trees any time of the year based on the type of the trees. Park, yard, urban areas, open field, balcony, rooftops; roadside places, etc. are best places to plant trees. To make life peaceful, there is no alternative to tree plantation."

He took the bundle of money and went to his class teacher.\"Ayat, what brings you here?\" asked his teacher.\"Ma'am, I found this bundle of money on my way to school. I thought I should give it to you. Maybe someone lost it,\" replied Ayat.\n\nHis teacher was impressed by Ayat's honesty and kindness. She checked the bundle of money, found a small note with a name and phone number. She called the number and informed the person that Ayat had found the money. It turned out that the money belonged to an old woman who had saved it up for her grandson's treatment. She had lost it while going back from the bank.\n\nThe old woman was grateful when she got her money back. Then she thanked Ayat and his teacher for their honesty and kindness. She even invited Ayat to her house and gave him some home-cooked sweets as a token of gratitude. Ayat felt happy to see the smile on the old woman's face. He realized that helping others could bring joy and happiness to one's life. He decided to start a small charity program in his school to help the poor and needy."

Or, what's going on in our neighbouring countries?\n\nFahim : Really not.\n\nNadim : But I know, because I read newspapers regularly. Newspapers can provide you with the news of the home and abroad.

For this, it's called the storehouse of knowledge.\n\nFahim : You're right.\n\nNadim : Newspaper can make you introduce to the culture and customs of different countries of the world. You can know some such important information which are applicable to your practical life.\n\nFahim : You've opened my eyes. Now, I can feel the necessity of reading newspapers.

          "explanation": "a. February 21 is a memorable day in our national history because on this day in 1952, the heroic son's of Bengal laid down their lives to establish Bangla as a state language of the undivided Pakistan. On this day, we pay tribute to the language martyrs because of their sacrifice for the rightful place of mother tongue.\nb. The then Governor General of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Zinnah, is responsible to raise a storm of protest. In a public meeting in Dhaka, he declared Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan, which disregarded the language rights of the Bangalee. Therefore, a mass protest started across the country.\nc. The Pakistani government banned all sorts of public meetings and gatherings to stop the protest that began following Mohammad Ali Jinnah's declaration of Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan and continued non-stop.\nd. Against the declaration of outlawing all sorts of public meeting and rallies, the students of Dhaka University brought out a peaceful protest procession on 21 February, defying the law.\ne. The Language Movement of 1952 kindled the sparks of independence movement in East Pakistan by making the Bangalees aware of their rights. Thus, the Language Movement is related to the independence movement of Bangladesh."
