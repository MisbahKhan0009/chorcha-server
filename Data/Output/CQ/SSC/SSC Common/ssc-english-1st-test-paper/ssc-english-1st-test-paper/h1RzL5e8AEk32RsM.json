And it was a good opportunity for me to fulfil my sight seeing desire. I along with some of my friends went there. I visited the Mazar of Khan Jahan Ali at Bagerhat. We stayed there for a day. The Mazar stands on a raised ground. The tomb is made of stone. Khan Jahan Ali came here from Delhi to preach Islam. He died on 25 October 1459. We saw many other things and enjoyed them. There is a big tank in front of the Mazar. There are some crocodiles in the big tank. When the caretaker calls them, they come near. It is very interesting. The visitors sometimes give the crocodiles something to eat. We also visited the historical shatgambuj Mosque. It stands on sixty pillars and it has 81 beautiful domes. It looks very beautiful. I have come to learn that it is a World Heritage Site. The visit really widened my outlook. When I remember the visit, I feel I should visit other historical places of our country."

The pond was full of water. When he began to drink water, a wave swept him away. He was about to drown. There was a tree on the bank of the pond and a dove was sitting on a branch of it. She noticed that the ant was about to drown. Feeling pity for the ant, the dove wanted to save him. So, she dropped a leaf in front of the ant. The ant got on the leaf and the leaf, slowly reach the bank of the pond. Thus, the dove saved the ant's life. Being grateful, the ant thanked her a lot. Another day, when the ant was seeking food under that tree, he noticed that a hunter was aiming at the dove. The dove did not notice it. The ant thought, \"I must save the life of the dove as she saved mine the other day\". So, he bit on the right leg of the hunter. At this, the hunter's hands trembled and the arrow missed its aim. Then, the dove flew away and was saved."

Cocurricular activities are very important. They help you learn new skills outside of the classroom.\nKabir : Really? Like what?\nLeon : Well, for one, they help build your confidence. Performing on stage or participating in a sport can boost your self-esteem.\nKabir : I guess that makes sense. What else?\nLeon : They also teach you teamwork and leadership skills. When you're part of a group, you learn how. to work together and take on different roles.\nKabir : That's true. I noticed that in our drama rehearsals already.\nLeon : See? Moreover, such activities can make you more disciplined and organized. Balancing schoolwork and activities teaches you time management.\nKabir : I didn't think about it that way, So, it's not just about having fun?\nLeon : Exactly, It's fun, but it's also about learning and growing. And colleges and employers look for well-rounded individuals who have more than just good grades.\nKabir : I see. There are so many advantages.\nLeon : Yeah. Not only that, even the foreign universities look for extra curricular activities in applicants' documents. They value those certificates highly.\nKabir : Wow, thanks, Bhaiya. I'll definitely continue my journey with the drama club. I also want to join, English Language Club and Environment Club.\nLeon : Please, go ahead. That's a good decision, Kabir. You're going to learn a lot and have a great time.\nKabir : Thank you, Bhaiya.\nLeon : You're most welcome. Let me know if you need any help."

      "uddipok": "Everyone must play a part in protecting the environment. There are many things you can do on your own every day to help save the planet. Here are some suggestions.\nREDUCE!\nReally, the best thing we can do for the planet is to use its resources properly. Our unplanned activities are mainly responsible for the environmental crisis. Here are some questions you can ask yourself before buying something, \"Do 1 really need this?\" or \"Is there another product which would do the same thing but more sustainable?\" Or ask the question, \"Will this last a long time?\" Some other questions may be, \"Do I know how this item was made, how it will be used and how it will be disposed of?\"\nREUSE!\nWhat do you think of using your own ceramic cup or mug at your school or local club? It means there are no plastic cups to throw away. You can wash it and reuse it every day. Unfortunately, we are encouraged to buy a new \"improved\" item even if the one we have can be repaired or reused. When we buy things, we should buy those that are durable; we should use them properly, and have them repaired when necessary. If we practise this, many things will not only last a life-time, but also be passed on for future use. However, if something is truly unusable for its original purposes, try to be more creative and think of how else it might be used. When you're done with it, think of whether someone else might be able to use it. You can donate some of the things to the poor. You may also sell some of your used items through personal advertisements in a local newspaper or in social media.\nRECYCLE!\nRather than throwing an item out when neither you nor anyone else can make use of it, have it recycled. And if recycling is not possible, it is better to send goods to a landfill or have them burned up. Find out what types of materials can be recycled in your area. Clean and sort the materials before putting them out in the bin. Recycling your drink and food cans means there will be less trash in a resource recovery facility or landfill. Moreover, a company can use the old cans to make new ones.",
