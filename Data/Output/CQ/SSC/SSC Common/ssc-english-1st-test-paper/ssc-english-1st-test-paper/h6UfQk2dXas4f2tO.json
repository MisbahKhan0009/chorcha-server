Then answer the questions.\nMay Day or International Workers' Day is observed on May 1 all over the world today to commemorate the historical struggle and sacrifices of the working people to establish an eight-hour workday. It is a public holiday in almost all the countries of the world.\nSince the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries in Europe and the US, the workers in mills and factories had been working a long shift, fourteen or even more hours a day.\nOn May 1s in 1886, inspired by the trade unions, half of the workers at the McCormick Harvester Machine Company in Chicago went on strike demanding an eight-hour workday. Two days later, a workers' rally was held near the McCormick Harvester Machine Company and about 6000 workers joined it. The rally was addressed by the labour leaders. They urged the workers to stand together, to go on with their struggle and not to give in to their bosses. At one point of the rally, some strikebreakers started leaving the meeting place. The strikers went down the street to bring them back. Suddenly, about 200 policemen attacked them with clubs and revolvers. One striker was killed instantly, five or six others were seriously wounded and many others were injured.\nThe events of May 1, 1886 are a reminder that workers will continue to be exploited until they stand up and speak out to gain better working conditions, better'pay and better lives.\nChoose the best answer from the alternatives:",

As different water sources flow together, the pollution can spread easily and quickly. Causes of water pollution include:\n* increased sediment from soil\n* erosion\n* improper waste disposal and littering\n* leakage of soil pollution into water supplies\n* organic materials that decay in water supplies\nIn fact, polluting the land means polluting the water. Throwing away a toxic substance on the ground near a water source means it eventually reaches the body of water. As a result, the water is polluted. Industrial wastes must not be disposed in rivers or lakes. We need to be more careful about disposing household wastes too. Use of pesticides means that when it rains, chemicals used in the lawn or garden wash into the water bodies. Therefore, we must be aware of the dangers of using pesticides as they may pollute our rivers, canals and lakes.\n\nQuestion:\nWater is all (a) _______ us.

          "explanation": "Our National Flag\n\nThe national flag of Bangladesh is a powerful symbol of the country’s identity, independence, and pride. It features a simple yet striking design: a red circle set slightly toward the hoist on a green rectangular field. The green background represents the lush greenery of Bangladesh, symbolizing the fertility, youth, and vitality of its land. The red circle signifies the rising sun and the blood of those who sacrificed their lives for the nation’s independence during the Liberation War of 1971. The flag’s design was first conceived during the early stages of the independence movement and was officially adopted on January 17, 1972. The flag reflects the country's struggle for freedom and its commitment to progress and peace. The red and green colors hold deep emotional significance for the people of Bangladesh, reminding them of their hard-won sovereignty and the resilience of their nation.\nThe national flag is prominently displayed on government buildings, schools, and public spaces during national holidays and celebrations such as Independence Day and Victory Day. It inspires a sense of unity and patriotism among the citizens. For the people of Bangladesh, their flag is not just a piece of cloth but a living symbol of their history, culture, and aspirations for a prosperous future."

          "explanation": "The Truthful Boy\n\n\nIn his boyhood, Hazrat Abdul Quadir Zilani (R.) was going to Baghdad for education. On the eve of his departure from home, his mother said to him, \"My son, never tell a lie and don't get frightened in danger.\"\n\nWith these words in his heart, he set out on his journey. On the way, the caravan he was travelling with was attacked by a group of robbers. The robbers began searching everyone's belongings and taking away whatever valuables they could find.\n\nOne of the robbers came to him and asked if he had anything valuable. Calmly, the young Abdul Quadir replied, \"Yes, I have forty gold coins sewn inside my clothes.\" The robber was surprised by his honesty and took him to the leader of the gang.\n\nThe leader asked, \"Why did you tell the truth when you knew we would take your money?\" The boy replied, \"Before leaving home, I promised my mother I would never tell a lie. I fear breaking her trust more than I fear losing my wealth.\"\n\nHearing this, the leader was deeply moved. Tears filled his eyes as he said, \"You fear your mother's words, but we do not fear the words of our Creator.\" He immediately repented for his sins and decided to give up his life of crime.\n\nHis fellow robbers also followed him, and the entire gang turned over a new leaf. Thus, the honesty of a young boy not only saved his own life but also changed the lives of many others.\n\nFrom that day, Hazrat Abdul Quadir Zilani (R.) became an example of truthfulness and righteousness for people all over the world.\n"
