Climate change is increasing the water temperature in rivers, lakes and seas. This means there is less food and oxygen available for fish. It also means the fish may not grow fully and may have fewer offsprings. Some fishes will become extinct if temperatures rise even by one or two degrees celsius.\nClimate change increases the pressure on fish population. Fishes are one of the world's most valuable biological assets. Forty percent of people in the world eat fish as their main source of protein. If we fail to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we will increase the pressure on fish. As a result, people who depend on fish will suffer from hunger and poverty.\n\nQuestion:\nIt is (a) — from the passage that global warming is (b) — great threat for fish population.

          "explanation": "Drug Addiction\nA drug is usually used as a medicine to cure diseases. But sometimes it is taken by some people as a habit to get amusement or relief from pain. This habit of taking the harmful drug is called drug addiction. Drug addiction is a curse of modern civilization. Nowadays, it has become a global problem. Drug addiction has grasped the young generation in our country. The people who take the drug cannot stop taking it. There are some reasons behind this addiction. Some take drugs to forget their painful past or present. Some take drugs in pursuit of pleasure. Some people, at first, take a drug as fun but afterwards, it turns into an addiction for them. The aftereffects of drug addiction are very harmful and serious. The health of the addicts breaks down. They lose their mental and physical power. They lose their social status and the love of their nearer and dearer ones as well. Everybody dislikes or hates them. Various kinds of diseases attack them. They suffer from amnesia, insomnia, nausea, physical weakness, blood pressure and from many other critical diseases. Their lungs, kidneys and livers are also damaged. Drugs are very expensive. So, the addicts often go for stealing, hijacking, killing and all sorts of misdeeds to manage money. For this reason, it should be stopped at any cost. Addiction to drugs can be checked by creating social awareness. The mass media can play an effective role in this regard. Seminars, discussions and debates should be held in schools, colleges and universities now and then. The government alone cannot solve this problem. People must cooperate with it. Above all, the rules of religion can play the most important role."
