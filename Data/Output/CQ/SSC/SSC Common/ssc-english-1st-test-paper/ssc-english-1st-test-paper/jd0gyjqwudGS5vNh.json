          "explanation": "A Winter Morning\nA winter morning has its own exceptional natural aspects as well as its effects on human and animal life. A winter morning is misty and cold. There is dense fog everywhere. Sometimes, the fog is so dense that the sun-rays cannot get through it. Everything looks hazy. The scenery of a winter morning is really charming in rural areas. Dewdrops on grass and leaves sparkle like pearls in the sunrays. Generally, people wake up late in the morning. They shiver in cold. They wear warm clothes. Old people and children are found basking in the morning sun. People usually have date juice and various native 'pithas' as breakfast. Cattle remain in their sheds. However, in cities, a winter morning does not make much change in life as it is not too cold there. People wake up at their usual time, wear colourful warm clothes and go to their work place. Students are seen in the most colourful warm clothes. The nature is dull and gloomy here, too. Both in rural and urban areas, poor people are the worst sufferers. They do not have enough warm clothes to protect themselves from the biting cold. Street children gather straw and papers and make fire to warm themselves. The communication system is disrupted which causes much hardship to the people. However, the scenery of a winter morning is very transitory. It starts disappearing as the day advances. My personal feeling about a winter morning is that it is a bane for the poor, but a boon for the rich."

Suddenly his mother woke up and told him to give her a glass of water. But he found that there was no water in the house.\n\nWithout any hesitation, Bayazid took the water pot and went out in search of water. It was a dark and cold night, and everyone was asleep. He walked a long distance to the nearest well. After collecting the water, he hurried back home. But when he reached home, he saw that his mother had fallen asleep again.\n\nBayazid did not want to wake her up. So, he stood beside her bed with the glass of water in his hand. He remained standing the whole night, waiting patiently for his mother to wake up. When his mother opened her eyes in the morning, she was surprised to see Bayazid standing with the glass of water. Tears came to her eyes, and she hugged her son with love.\n\nBayazid’s deep love and respect for his mother made him a great man later in life. His story continues to inspire children to honor and care for their pa\nrents."
