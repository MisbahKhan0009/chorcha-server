          "explanation": "Patriotism\nPatriotism is a great virtue that expresses people's true love towards their country. Because of this quality, they love and do good deeds for the country's welfare. Bangladesh gained its independence in 1971 with the virtue of patriotism. It is a major evidence of the people's patriotic quality towards the country, Absorbed in the motto of patriotism, they fought against the occupation forces of Pakistan and earned victory. Millions of people embraced martyrdom due to the noble cause of freedom. Patriotism shows profound spirit and dynamism of a true citizen of a country. His/her thoughts and ideas always develop centering the welfare of the country as well as its people. Patriotism means not only to love one's country but also to be empathetic towards the people and stand by the poor, underprivileged and destitute. During the incidents of natural calamities, generous people must stand by the victims. They must come forward to the help of the flood and earthquake-hit people. People devoid of this prioritize personal benefit over the country or its people. Also, the lack of compassion challenges the unity among citizens. On the other hand, patriotism makes a person responsible and courageous. Patriotic people with their good deeds and contributions make the world a habitable place. We must nurture patriotism in us for the welfare of the humanity."

His classmates want to make him understand the fact, but he does not want to understand. One day, his class teacher called him and asked him what was wrong. Fahian hesitated to answer the question at first and then replied that he had no idea. Clearly, he knew something but wasn't willing to share it. His teacher also understood that Fahian wasn't answering truthfully. However, instead of scolding or pressurizing him, the teacher tactfully asked various questions. While answering them one by one, Fahian revealed that he played video games at night with his online friends who are living abroad. The teacher finally found the answer to why Fahian often feels sleepy during the class. Before forbidding Fahian from staying awake at night, the teacher asked him about his friends and then expressed how important friends are in our lives. Afterwards, the teacher tried to explain to him how important a good sleeping schedule is as well. He advised Fahian to make a timetable that allowed him not only to play games with his friends but also to properly sleep and rest. After this meaningful conversation with the teacher, Fahian understood how important balance is in people's lives and promised to work on improving his habits."

Everything from groceries to fuel is getting more expensive What do you think is causing this?\nBakul : Several factors contribute to the price hikes. One major cause is the increase in production costs, such as higher prices for raw materials and labor.\nNoyon : That makes sense. I've also heard that supply chain disruptions is a big issue.\nBakul : Exactly. With fewer goods available, the prices go up due to higher demand and lower supply. Inflation also plays a big role.\nNoyon : So, what can we do to oyercome this situation?\nBakul : There are a few measures we can take. Governments can implement policies to stabilize prices, such as controlling inflation and supporting local production to reduce dependency on imports.\nNoyon : That's true. Encouraging people to buy local products can also help.\nBakul : Absolutely. On a personal level, we can try to be more mindful of our spending and reduce waste.\nNoyon : Right. We can also raise awareness and advocate for policies that address the root causes of price hikes.\nBakul : Definitely. It's a challenging situation, we can manage the impact of rising prices.\nNoyon : I do strongly agree with you. Let's hope things get better soon. Thanks for the suggestions.\nBakul : Anytime, Noyon.
