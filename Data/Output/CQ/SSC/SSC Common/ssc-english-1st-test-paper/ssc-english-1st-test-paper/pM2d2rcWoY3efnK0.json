Some fishes will become extinct if temperatures rise even by one or two degrees celsius.\nClimate change increases the pressure on fish population. Fishes are one of the world's most valuable biological assets. Forty percent of people in the world eat fish as their main source of protein.

          "explanation": "A farmer is an individual who cultivates crops and raises livestock to provide food, raw materials, and other essential products to society. A farmer’s day begins early, often before dawn, as he tends to his fields or animals, working long hours under varying weather conditions. The life of a farmer is simple yet demanding, requiring hard physical labor, patience, and a deep understanding of nature and the seasons. Farmers play a crucial role in the nation's economy by producing food, contributing to rural development, and ensuring food security for the population. Their hard work supports entire industries, from agriculture to transportation and retail. To improve the condition of farmers, it is essential to provide them with better access to modern farming techniques, financial support, fair market prices for their produce, and improved infrastructure for irrigation, transportation, and storage. Additionally, reducing the burden of debt and offering educational resources can empower farmers to thrive in their profession."
