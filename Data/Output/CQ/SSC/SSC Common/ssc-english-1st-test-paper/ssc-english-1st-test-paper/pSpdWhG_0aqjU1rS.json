Within few yàrds in their possession, they are sleeping, socializing, cooking and even beautifying themselves. These people are living in such an inhuman condition! This cannot be the picture of life in a civilized society. Also, they are polluting the area. They are the least bothered about their health and hygiene. They have their own home and identity at their own village. They are here thinking that the city life will make their life better. What an irony! Human flow from the rural areas to the urban areas is a big social problem in many countries like ours. These floating people are definitely a burden to the cities where they migrate. When the number is huge, it is difficult for any state to rehabilitate them quickly. People become rootless sometimes due to climate change, river erosion, social discrepancies or poverty. However, we cannot solve this problem overnight. But we can take steps to improve their lifestyle.\nThe floating people live on footpaths in some makeshift houses.

          "explanation": "The pie chart shows the subject preferences of students in a secondary school. It highlights their interest in four key subjects: Mathematics, Science, Bangla, and English. According to the chart, Mathematics is the most preferred subject, with 35% of the students showing interest in it. This is followed by Science, which attracts 25% of the students. Bangla is also popular, drawing the attention of 23% of the students. English, however, is the least chosen subject, with only 17% showing interest in it.\nFrom the data, it is clear that students tend to favor subjects related to logic and reasoning, such as Mathematics and Science, over languages. This could be due to the growing importance of science and technology in modern education and career paths. Nonetheless, the significant interest in Bangla reflects a continued appreciation for the mother tongue. Overall, the chart shows a balanced but slightly science-leaning academic interest among students."
