Climate change is increasing the water temperature in rivers, lakes and seas. This means there is less food and oxygen available for fish. It also means the fish may not grow fully and may have fewer offsprings. Some fishes will become extinct if temperatures rise even by one of two degrees Celsius.\nClimate change increases the pressure on fish population. Fishes are one of the world's most valuable biological assets. Forty percent of people in the world eat fish as their main source of protein. If we fail to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we will increase the pressures on fish. As a result, people who depend on fish will suffer from hunger and poverty.\nGlobal warming is posing a great (a) ___ to fish population.

          "explanation": "Price Hike\nPrice hike means rise in prices of essential commodities. It is a common phenomenon in our country. The prices of essential commodities are increasing by leaps and bounds. Indeed, price of daily commodities has gone beyond the reach of the common people. There are many causes of price hike. Insufficient supply of daily commodities is mainly responsible for price hike. Our population is increasing rapidly, but our food production is not increasing proportionately. For this, we do not get enough food in comparison to our increasing demands. Moreover, frequent natural disasters like flood, drought, cyclone, etc. hamper our food production, which accelerates the price hike of essential food items. On the other hand, hoarding is another important factor of soaring price level. Some dishonest traders devoid of morality hoard essential goods and create artificial shortage in the market. Then they sell the goods at higher price. Political unrest like strikes is also responsible for a surge in price. Lack of market supervision, black marketing and smuggling also contribute to price hike. The phenomenon has increased the suffering of the common people. The poor and the middle class are mostly affected by it. But, the worst sufferers of it are those who live from hand to mouth. They find it hard to feed their family members. Some of them remain half-fed. As a result, they suffer from malnutrition. Unusual price hike hampers the economic balance of a country. The government should take effective steps to tackle the situation, most notably by increasing food production. Each and every shop must have a price chart fixed by the government. The law enforcing agencies should be deployed in the market places to monitor the market price. Legal actions must be taken against the dishonest businessmen and hoarders. Actually, people of all walks of life should also cooperate with the government."

He said, \"Dear sir, I've got a note of Tk. 100. What can I do with it?\" Mr Hasan said, \"Keep it with you until the owner of the money is found.\" The boy said, \"Sir, I'm afraid, I may lose it. Would you please keep it with you?\" Mr Hasan agreed and other boys also agreed to it. According to the teacher's suggestion, the boy put up a notice inscribing, \"Some Taka has been found in the school yard. The owner of the money may take it from the class teacher, Mr Hasan.\" They waited for seven days, but nobody came to claim the money even after a week. Then, the teacher asked the boys what they wanted to do with the money. The little boy asked to wait for two days more. But the result was same. Then, some of the boys proposed to give the money to the mosque: Some of them told to give it to a poor man. But the little boy proposed to give it to the old blind man in front of their school. All the boys agreed and gave it to the old blind man. Everyone praised the honesty and kindness of the little boy."

The next two dominant sources of environment are vehicles and household. wastes, each contributing 15 % 15 \\% 15% of pollution. The contribution of power house to the pollution of environment is 2 % 2 \\% 2% . Apart from these pollutants, there are some other pollutants which cause the rest 8 % 8 \\% 8% pollution altogether. It is evident from the pie-chart that industrial wastes and toxic chemicals are mostly responsible for environment pollution, and the least contributor among the mentioned sources is power house. The data obtained from the pie-chat suggest that we should reconsider the random use of different chemicals in mills and factories for the greater interest of public health. It is true that we cannot keep away from such elements, but we must perform industrial activities in a planned way so as not to harm the environment."

Please share it with me if you find it comfortable.\nMaruf : Have you ever thought about how important it is to get GPA-5 in board exams?\nSadat : Yeah, Maruf. It seems like everyone is obsessed with it. But is it. really necessary?\nMaruf : Well. I think GPA-5 can open the door a lot of opportunities. For example, it can help you get admitted into a good college or univ́ersity. Many institutions have entry requirements and good GPA plays a big role in that case.\nSadat : That's true: But what about after college? Does it still matter?\nMaruf : It does. Some employers look at your academic performance while recruiting. A high GPA can make your resume stand out.\nSadat : I see. But, isn't practical experience and skill just as important as a good result?\nMaruf : Absolutely. Practical experience and skills are crucial. But a good GPA shows that you're disciplined and can handle academic challenges.\nSadat : So, it's about balance then. We need both good grades and practical skills.\nMaruf : Exactly. Focusing solely on GPA isn't enough. You need to develop other skills too, like communication, teamwork, and problem-solving.\nSadat : That makes sense. So, a GPA-5 is important, but it's not the only thing that matters.\nMaruf : Right. We strive for good grades, but also focus on gaining experience and developing our skills.\nSadat : Thank you, Maruf. You raised a good topic to have a constructive discussion!\nMaruf : Anytime, Sadat. Let's work hard and make the best use of our opportunities."
