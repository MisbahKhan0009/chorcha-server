          "question": "",
          "explanation": "Price Hike\nPrice hike means rise in prices of essential commodities. It is a common phenomenon in our country. The prices of essential commodities are increasing by leaps and bounds. Indeed, price of daily commodities has gone beyond the reach of the common people. There are many causes of price hike. Insufficient supply of daily commodities is mainly responsible for price hike. Our population is increasing rapidly, but our food production is not increasing proportionately. For this, we do not get enough food in comparison to our increasing demands. Moreover, frequent natural disasters like flood, drought, cyclone, etc. hamper our food production, which accelerates the price hike of essential food items. On the other hand, hoarding is another important factor of soaring price level. Some dishonest traders devoid of morality hoard essential goods and create artificial shortage in the market. Then they sell the goods at higher price. Political unrest like strikes is also responsible for a surge in price. Lack of market supervision, black marketing and smuggling also contribute to price hike. The phenomenon has increased the suffering of the common people. The poor and the middle class are mostly affected by it. But, the worst sufferers of it are those who live from hand to mouth. They find it hard to feed their family members. Some of them remain half- fed. As a result, they suffer from malnutrition. Unusual price hike hampers the economic balance of a country. The government should take effective steps to tackle the situation, most notably by increasing food production. Each and every shop must have a price chart fixed by the government. The law enforcing agencies should be deployed in the market places to monitor the market price, Legal actions must be taken against the dishonest businessmen and hoarders. Actually, people of all walks of life should also co- operate with the government."

          "explanation": "Necessity of Physical Labour\nOnce, there was an old king in a certain country. He was endowed with many good qualities. But one negative side of his character was that he did not like physical labour. As a result, he grew bulky. So, he could not move from one place to another. Then he called in a doctor. The doctor was very clever and wise. He realised the cause of his illness. He prescribed no medicine for the king. He only asked the king to buy a club. The king did so. The next day, the doctor took the king in the garden and requested him to move the club in the air till his hands got moistened. The king did not understand what the doctor was doing. Yet, he followed the doctor's advice. The doctor requested him to do the same regularly. He also ensured the king that by doing so, he could get rid of his illness. The king followed the doctor's advice strictly. After a few days, the king began to grow thinner and thinner. Thus within a month, the bulky king got rid of his illness. The king then could realize the necessity of physical labour."

In your last letter you wanted to know about the co-curricular activities in my school.\nYou know that I am lucky to study in such a big and famous school which offers us facilities to learn a lot of things besides studies. We can depend on our teachers not only for study matters but also for matters related to our interests. Some of them run different clubs in school. The clubs are places where one can go and pursue his or her hobby. I'm a member of the debating club. We practise debating within the club and arrange debating competitions among different classes and among other schools as well. Our English teacher who runs this club, not only guides us in writing good speeches but also shows us how to present them. 'Our school arranges essay competitions and book reading competitions. Moreover, my school offers a wide range of extra-curricular activities for the students. The school has a musical group and a lot of dramas are played by the students. Besides, the students enjoy hockey and football as extra-curricular activities. Teachers consult with the students at personal level and encourage them to work more and more. The students of this school learn not only for examinations but also for life. In short, I can tell you studying in this school is a great experience. Along with the regular study, we can develop our extracurricular abilities as well.\nI guess, you are planning to shift to a new school. If you ask for suggestion from me, I'll recommend my school without any hesitation.\n\nWith best wishes\nMonir\n"

It’s impossible to sleep with all the heat and no fans running.\nMax: Not to mention, businesses are suffering too. Shops can’t keep their refrigerators running, and factories face disruptions. It’s affecting the economy.\nDavid: Exactly. Even in hospitals, I’ve heard there’s trouble maintaining critical operations. The constant power cuts are making life difficult for everyone.\nMax: And students like us are suffering too. Imagine having exams but no electricity to prepare! It’s such a setback.\nDavid: True. It feels like no one is addressing the issue seriously. They should invest more in alternative energy sources or at least improve the power grid.\nMax: Agreed. Solar energy and other renewables could help reduce this dependency. But it takes planning and commitment.\nDavid: Yes, and until then, we need better schedules for power cuts so people can plan their days. Let’s hope for a better solution soon.\nMax: I hope so too, David. This situation really needs urgent attention from the authorities."
