Then answer the questions below.\nGraffiti's potency lies in its subversive, guerrilla nature, Unlike wall art, which is typically organized and sanctioned, graffiti thrives on immediacy, spontaneity, and the risk of persecution. Where wall art may take time and care, graffiti is often quick, requiring speed and anonymity due to the threat of detection. Its purpose is to challenge power, counter surveillance, and inscribe messages that are otherwise censored or suppressed. The July uprising brought new dimensions to this medium of dissent. Spray-painted slogans defied erasure, embodying collective rage and revolutionary solidarity. Demands like \"Ek dofa, ek dabi, shoirachar tui kobe jabi?\" surfaced as cries for justice, echoing the French philosopher Jacques Derrida's assertion that \"What cannot be said .... must not be silenced but written.\" A strong sense of inclusivity was reflected in the wall art and graffiti during and after the July uprising, which highlighted the case of the marginalized and-minoritized people in multiple instances. Numerous graffiti and wall art pieces not only called for justice but also carried a broader message of liberation, \"Not a land of one nation, Bangladesh is a land of many communities\" symbolizing the interconnected struggles of all communities. It underscored the message i.e. our collective liberation is intertwined, with the fight for justice uniting people across regions and backgrounds. The true power of graffiti lies in its resilience; it persists as a medium for revolutionary memory and collective consciousness. It speaks for those silenced, ensures the struggles of the marginalized endure and as Banksy's words suggest, comforts the disturbed while disturbing the comfortable.\nChoose the correct answer from the following alternatives.",

Moreover, he was fond of gold though he had a lot of it. He thought if he had the golden touch, he would be the happiest man. A wise God granted his wish promptly. One morning, he got up early and started walking around in his garden as usual and touched a white rose in the garden. Then he saw, to his utter surprise, that the flower had turned into a piece of white gold. He was amazed and touched another plant which, in an instant, turned into gold. It was really amusing to him. He started playing with his new found blessing. Right at this moment, his only daughter entered the garden. When he embraced his daughter to share his delight with her, to his sheer grief, he found her being turned into a statue of gold. He became very shocked at this and prayed to God to take back the destructive blessing. After a few moments, the girl came to life. The king became happy."
