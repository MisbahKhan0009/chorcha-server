          "explanation": "(a) The sense of obligation to his village motivated Mr Islam to remain in that place instead of pursuing a career in the city. He wanted to work as a farmer, live with his family, and be close to his roots.\n(b) To Mr Islam and his brothers, the purpose of education is not only to pursue office jobs but also to contribute to their community. Despite being highly educated, the Islam brothers did not run after a conventional career like most people. Instead, they remained in their village and chose work that aligned with their academic background.\n(c) Mr Islam finds contentment in his village life through simple yet meaningful activities such as working on his own farm, resting in his own house, spending time with his family and reconnecting with old friends.\n(d) It can be inferred that education helped Islam brothers understand the significance of one's obligation towards his/her community. Realizing this obligation, they contributed actively to their community from their respective fields.\n(e) The Islam brothers convey an inspiring message about the relationship between one's roots and professional aspirations. They believe that the role of education goes beyond personal gain and it should also serve the community. As sons and daughters of the soil, it is our responsibility to utilize our learnings for the betterment of our roots.\n"

She co-authored the memoir \"I Am Malala: The Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban\" in 2013, which became an international bestseller. The same year, she established the Malala Fund, a non-profit organization advocating for girls' education worldwide.

          "question": "",
          "explanation": "Price Hike\nPrice hike means rise in prices of essential commodities. It is a common phenomenon in our country. The prices of essential commodities are increasing by leaps and bounds. Indeed, price of daily commodities has gone beyond the reach of the common people. There are many causes of price hike. Insufficient supply of daily commodities is mainly responsible for price hike. Our population is increasing rapidly, but our food production is not increasing proportionately. For this, we do not get enough food in comparison to our increasing demands. Moreover, frequent natural disasters like flood, drought, cyclone, etc. hamper our food production, which accelerates the price hike of essential food items. On the other hand, hoarding is another important factor of soaring price level. Some dishonest traders devoid of morality hoard essential goods and create artificial shortage in the market. Then they sell the goods at higher price. Political unrest like strikes is also responsible for a surge in price. Lack of market supervision, black marketing and smuggling also contribute to price hike. The phenomenon has increased the suffering of the common people. The poor and the middle class are mostly affected by it. But, the worst sufferers of it are those who live from hand to mouth. They find it hard to feed their family members. Some of them remain half- fed. As a result, they suffer from malnutrition. Unusual price hike hampers the economic balance of a country. The government should take effective steps to tackle the situation, most notably by increasing food production. Each and every shop must have a price chart fixed by the government. The law enforcing agencies should be deployed in the market places to monitor the market price, Legal actions must be taken against the dishonest businessmen and hoarders. Actually, people of all walks of life should also co- operate with the government."

She used to visit the nearby forest beside their town every week. One day, she planned to go deep into the forest to see other creatures with her classmates. After walking a mile, they saw a beautiful freshwater canal flowing through the forest. Suddenly, she saw a small deer of golden colour which was drinking water from the canal.\nLina and her classmates quietly watched the deer, being mesmerized by their beauty. They stood still, not wanting to scare the animals away. Suddenly, a terrifying sound came from the water. The mother deer lifted her head. She became alert and ready to protect her fawn.\nLina then noticed a crocodile coming nearer towards the bank of the river, slowly making its way toward the fawn. It looked hungry and had its eyes set on the fawn. Lina instantly whispered to her classmates, \"Let's make some noise and throw stones to scare the crocodile away.\" They threw some stones towards the crocodile and screamed loudly. The noise startled the crocodile, causing it to hesitate for a moment before making its way back into the water.\nThe mother deer and her fawn were safe. Lina and her friends felt a sense of relief and joy after protecting the innocent creatures. They sat by the canal afterward, reflecting on the experience. Lina said, \"We should always be kind and protect those who are vulnerable. Just like today, small actions can make a big difference.\" Her friends nodded in agreement, realizing the importance of their actions.\nThey spent the rest of the day exploring the forest, feeling more connected to nature and each other."

They made him feel that he was 'chosen' and very 'special'.\nOne of his colleagues, Del Yocam said about Steve, \"I think his desire for complete control of whatever he makes derives directly from his personality and from the fact that he was abandoned at birth.\"\nJobs' mother taught him how to read and write before he went to the elementary school. So when he went to school, he found out that he knew everything that the teachers were teaching. He got bored and played pranks to keep himself busy. This continued for the first few years. It was clear from his behaviour that he could not accept other people's authority. He said, \"I encountered authority of a different kind that I have never encountered before, and I did not like it.\"\nA turning point came when he was in grade four. His teacher Imogene Hill watched him very closely for some time and soon found out how to handle him and get things done by him. In order to get things done she used to give him money and food. One day after school, she gave Jobs a workbook with math problems in it. She said, \"I want you to take it home and do this.\" She showed Jobs a huge lollipop and said, \"When you are done with it, if you get it mostly right, I will give you this and five dollars. \"Within two days, Jobs solved the math problem and returned the book to his teacher.\nThis continued for a couple of months and Jobs enjoyed learning so much that he did not need any return. Also he liked his teacher very much and wanted to please her. In Ms. Hill's class, Jobs felt he was special. At the end of the fourth grade, Jobs did very well. It was clear not only to Jobs and his parents but also to the teachers that he was exceptionally intelligent. The school proposed that Jobs should skip two classes and go into the seventh grade. This would mean that Jobs would find the study challenging and he would be motivated to study. His parents had him skip only one grade.",
