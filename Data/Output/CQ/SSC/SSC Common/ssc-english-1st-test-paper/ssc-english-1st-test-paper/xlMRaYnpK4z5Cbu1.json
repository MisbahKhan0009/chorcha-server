The virus comes out. through the nose and mouth in droplets and if a healthy person inhales the droplets, he or she will be affected too. The droplets can also sit on the surface of any object. When someone touches that surface with hands, the virus gets transmitted to his or her hands. After that if the person touches the nose, mouth or eyes, the virus can get into his or her respiratory system. After getting infected, the person might remain asymptomatic for several days or weeks. This, means the infected person may not show symptoms of sickness at the beginning. This period is heavily dangerous because the infected person unknowingly might affect other people. To avoid infection, social distancing, wearing masks while going outside and washing hands with soap and water may help.\nWrite a summary of the above passage in your own words.",

But one day, while cutting wood, his axe slipped from his hand and fell into a deep river nearby. The woodcutter became very sad because it was the only axe he had, and he could not afford a new one.\nHe sat on the riverbank and started crying. Suddenly, a kind fairy appeared from the water and asked him why he was crying. The woodcutter told her everything. The fairy dived into the river and came up with a golden axe . “Is this yours?” she asked. The woodcutter said, “No, this is not mine.”\nThen she brought a silver axe and asked the same question. Again, the woodcutter replied, “No, that’s not mine either.” Finally, she brought his old iron axe , and he happily said, “Yes! That one is mine!”\nThe fairy was very pleased with his honesty and gave him all three axes as a reward. The woodcutter went home joyfully and lived happily ever after. His honesty brought him unexpected blessings."

          "explanation": "Tamal: Hi Asif, I wanted to talk to you about something really important. Have you noticed how many trees are being cut down in our area lately?\nAsif: Yes, Tamal, I have. It's heartbreaking to see so many trees gone. But why do you think it's such a big deal?\nTamal: Deforestation is a serious problem, Asif. Cutting down trees at this rate is harmful to the environment. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen. Without them, the air becomes more polluted.\nAsif: Oh, I see. But I suppose we need land for housing and farming too, right?\nTamal: That’s true, but we need to strike a balance. Deforestation leads to soil erosion and loss of fertile land. It also destroys wildlife habitats, forcing animals to move or go extinct.\nAsif: I didn’t think of that. So deforestation affects both the land and the animals?\nTamal: Exactly! It also contributes to climate change. Without enough trees, carbon dioxide builds up in the atmosphere, causing global warming.\nAsif: That’s terrible! Is there anything we can do to stop it?\nTamal: Definitely. People need to be more aware of the consequences and plant more trees. Governments should enforce laws to regulate deforestation and promote sustainable practices.\nAsif: You’re right. I think we should also spread awareness in our community about the importance of saving trees.\nTamal: Great idea, Asif! If we all do our part, we can make a difference. Let’s start today.\nAsif: Absolutely! Thanks for bringing this up, Tamal. It’s a wake-up call."

Thus, they are responsible for the increase in the greenhouse gases.\n\n(c) I think the main cause of the increase in carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels. With the increase of industrial activities, the combustion of coal has increased. Besides coal, mineral oil and natural gas are also burned for various purposes. Thus, every time a fossil raw material is burned, it releases carbon dioxide into the air.\n\n(d) Enormous areas of forests are destroyed by the people every year to obtain wood and to clear regions for mining and to create pasture."
