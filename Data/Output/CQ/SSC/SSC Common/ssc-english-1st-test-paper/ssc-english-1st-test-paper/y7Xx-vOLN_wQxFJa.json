Our unique source of life and inspiration is our cultural and natural heritage. When we speak of 'World Heritage', it indicates places and sites that we inherited from the past and pass on to the future generation of the entire world.\nThe 'Shat Gambuj Mosque' in Bagerhat is such a heritage. It became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1985. Originally, the historic Mosque City was known as 'Khalifatabad'. It is situated at the outskirts of Bagerhat town--- not very far from the dense mangrove forest of the Sundarbans. Khalifatabad was a Muslim colony. It was founded by the Turkish general, a saint warrior Ulugh Khan Jahan in the 15th century. The infrastructure of the city reveals significant technical skills in many mosques as well as early Islamic monuments. Baked bricks were used for the construction of the buildings. The planning of the city was dominated by the tradition of Islamic architecture and the decorations were a combination of Mughal and Turkish architecture.\nKhan Jahan built a network of roads, bridges, public buildings and reservoirs to make the city habitable. There were about 360 mosques in the city. Among them the most remarkable is the multi-domed Shat Gombuj Mosque. The mosque is unique in the sense that it has 60 pillars that support the roof, with 77 low height domes. The 4 towers at 4 corners have smaller domes at the top as well. The vast prayer hall has 11 arched doorways on the east and 7 each on the north and south for light and ventilation. It has 7 aisles running along the length of the mosque and 11 deep curves between the slender stone columns. These columns support the curving arches created by the domes. The thickness of the arches is 6 feet and have slightly narrowing hollow and round wall.\nThe west wall in the interior has 11 'mihrabs' (niche in mosque pointing towards Makkah). These mihrabs are decorated with stonework and terracotta. The floor of the mosque is made of brick.\nBesides being used as a prayer hall, Khan Jahan used the mosque as his court too. Today, it is one of the greatest tourist attractions and one of the best architectural beauties of Bangladesh.\nChoose the correct answer from the alternatives:",

          "explanation": "A Rainy Day\nA rainy day is dull and gloomy. Sometimes, it drizzles and sometimes, it rains heavily all day long. The sky remains overcast with black clouds. The sun is hardly visible. Gusty wind blows from all sides. Birds keep standing on branches of trees or keep quiet in their nests. Cattle remain in their sheds and bellow for the fodder. Water stands here and there. Unpitched roads become muddy and slippery. Passers-by have to walk with umbrella over their head, shoes in hand and pants folded up to the knee. Sometimes people slip and fall on the muddy road. In cities, a rainy day is now a horror. The roads and streets in some towns and cities get flooded. Vehicles are seen stranding in knee-deep water in some areas due to water clogging. It causes gridlock across the city. It is a day of trouble and annoyance to the office-going people. They have to suffer from yarious inconveniences. But for the school going children, it is a delight to have a rainy day. If it rains heavily before their school time, they get a holiday. Sometimes, children, especially the boys play football in the rainwater in the nearby fields. A rainy day is a curse for the poor. The day labourers cannot go out for work and hence, they have to suffer a lot. However, I pass the day by listening to music, watching TV or reading journals. In short, a rainy day is a day of both pleasure and pain."

Sara stopped and asked the woman, \"Are you okay? Is there anything we can do to help?\" The woman looked up at them with tired eyes and said, \"I have lost my way, and I don’t have enough money to get back home. My baby is sick, and I don’t know what to do.\" Sara felt a wave of sympathy and looked at Juhayer, who was also concerned.\n\nSara quickly took out her pocket money and handed it to the woman, saying, \"This should help you buy food and medicine for your baby.\" The woman thanked them and wiped her tears. Juhayer, feeling a bit unsure, asked, \"Why don’t we help her find her way home?\" Sara nodded, and they both decided to walk with the woman for a while. After a few minutes, the woman said, \"I live just a few blocks away. Thank you for being so kind.\"\n\nWhen they reached her house, the woman invited them in. Her home was small but clean, and she introduced them to her husband, who was surprised and grateful for the help. \"You have saved us today,\" he said. Sara and Juhayer smiled, feeling happy to have made a difference. As they left, Sara told Juhayer, \"Always help others when you can, because you never know when you might need help too.\" They walked away, feeling proud of what they had do\nne.\n"

In your last letter you wanted to know about the co-curricular activities in my school.\nYou know that I am lucky to study in such a big and famous school which offers us facilities to learn a lot of things besides studies. We can depend on our teachers not only for study matters but also for matters related to our interests. Some of them run different clubs in school. The clubs are places where one can go and pursue his or her hobby. I'm a member of the debating club. We practise debating within the club and arrange debating competitions among different classes and among other schools as well. Our English teacher who runs this club, not only guides us in writing good speeches but also shows us how to present them. 'Our school arranges essay competitions and book reading competitions. Moreover, my school offers a wide range of extra-curricular activities for the students. The school has a musical group and a lot of dramas are played by the students. Besides, the students enjoy hockey and football as extra-curricular activities. Teachers consult with the students at personal level and encourage them to work more and more. The students of this school learn not only for examinations but also for life. In short, I can tell you studying in this school is a great experience. Along with the regular study, we can develop our extracurricular abilities as well.\nI guess, you are planning to shift to a new school. If you ask for suggestion from me, I'll recommend my school without any hesitation.\n\nWith best wishes\nMonir\n"

They can teach you a lot about life, and they help improve your imagination and creativity.\n\nRumi: Hmm, I never thought of it that way. But how do they improve creativity?\n\nSuma: Well, when you read stories, you visualize the characters, settings, and events in your mind. This helps you think creatively and come up with new ideas. Plus, some stories are full of adventure and lessons that can inspire you.\n\nRumi: That sounds cool, but I still don't know if I would enjoy it.\n\nSuma: Maybe you could try reading one story that interests you? It could be a fantasy, adventure, or mystery. You never know, you might end up liking it!\n\nRumi: Hmm, I'll think about it. But what if I don’t have time?\n\nSuma: Reading doesn’t need to take hours! You could start with short stories, and you can always read them in your free time. It’s also a great way to relax and take a break from everything else.\n\nRumi: Alright, Suma, you’ve convinced me. I’ll give it a try!\n\nSuma: That’s awesome, Rumi! I’m sure you’ll enjoy it once you start. Let me know what you think after reading your first story!\n"
