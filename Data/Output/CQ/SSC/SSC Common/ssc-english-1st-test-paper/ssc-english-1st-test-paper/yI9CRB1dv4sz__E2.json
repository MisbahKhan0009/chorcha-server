But they can control the increase in the amount of greenhouse gases and its effect on the atmosphere. Only during the last hundred years the carbon dioxide concentration has been raised alarmingly in the atmosphere and we humans can be held responsible for this. The main cause of the increase in carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels. Since the end of the 19th century, industrial activities increased rapidly giving rise to many factories. These factories required energy, which was produced through the combustion of coal. Besides coal, other sources of energy such as mineral oil and natural gas were also burned to heat our houses, run cars and airplanes or to produce electricity. Nowadays, about 85 million barrels of crude oil are burned daily. Every time a fossil raw material is burned, it releases carbon dioxide into the air. Therefore, it is clear that more and more greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide are being generated worldwide by humans. Moreover, we are also strengthening the greenhouse effect by deforestation, which means cutting down trees. Trees that are burned up release large volumes of carbon dioxide gas into the air. On the other hand, as forests absorb a lot of carbon dioxide from the air and deliver oxygen instead, we also destroy an important storehouse of carbon dioxide when we clear forests..\nChoose the correct answer from the alternatives.",

Al is used in phones, computers, even in hospitals. It's everywhere now.\nMyself: Exactly. One merit of Al is that it makes our work faster and easier. For example, machines can do repetitive tasks without getting tired.\nRitika: True. Al also helps in education, healthcare, and transportation. It can analyze data quickly and give us useful results.\nMyself: Another merit is that Al reduces human error.\nRitika: I heard, robots or Al systems can be more accurate than people in certain jobs.\nMyself: Yes, they do. But we have to cheak those properly.\nRitika: Yeah, that's for sure. However, there are also demerits. Al can reduce job opportunities because machines may replace human workers.\nMyself: Yes, that's a big concern. Also, AI systems are expensive to develop and maintain.\nRitika: And sometimes, AI can make mistakes if the data is wrong. It doesn't have human judgment or emotions.\nMyself: Exactly. So while Al has many merits like speed, accuracy, and efficiency, it also has demerits like job loss, high cost, and lack of human feelings.\nRitika: I agree. We should use AI wisely, balancing its benefits and drawbacks.\nMyself: Well said, Ritika. AI is powerful, but it must be handled with care..\nRitika: Well, I have to leave now. Bye:\nMyself: Bye, see you again later."
