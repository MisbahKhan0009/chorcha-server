Climate change is increasing the water temperature in rivers, lakes and seas. This means there is less food and oxygen available for fish. It also means the fish may not grow fully and may have fewer offsprings. Some fishes will become extinct if temperatures rise even by one or two degrees celsius.\nClimate change increases the pressure on fish population. Fishes are one of the world's most valuable biological assets. Forty percent of people in the world eat fish as their main source of protein. If we fail to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, we will increase the pressure on fish. As a result, people who depend on fish will suffer from hunger and poverty.\n\nQuestion:\nIt is (a) — from the passage that global warming is (b) — great threat for fish population. (c) — global warming, food production and oxygen (d) — in water decrease. As a result, some fishes may be extinct (e) ——.",

Last Sunday, I witnessed a tragic street accident. It took place near our school. There is a turning there. It is an interchange of five roads. Now and then, there occurs a traffic jam. On that day, while I was going to school, I saw a car coming from the western direction. A rickshaw, with a school boy and his mother, was coming from the opposite direction at about 8:30 a.m. While crossing the point, the car hit the rickshaw. The rickshawpuller was able to jump fróm his seat but the boy and his mother fell on the street. The boy and his mother were seriously wounded. I rushed to them. Some other passers-by also came forward to help them. We led them to a nearby doctor's chamber. I felt pity for the school boy, he was of my age. In fact, for having no traffic police at that place, such accidents frequently occur. The authority should take steps to stop road accidents that very often claim peoples' lives."

Moreover, he was fond of gold though he had a lot of it. He thought if he had the golden touch, he would be the happiest man. A wise God granted his wish promptly, One morning, he got up early and started walking around in his garden as usual and touched a white rose in the garden. Then he saw, to his utter surprise, that the flower had turned into a piece of white gold. He was amazed and touched another plant which, in an instant, turned into gold. It was really amusing to him. He started playing with his new found blessing. Right at this moment, his only daughter entered the garden. When he embraced his daughter to share his delight with her, to his sheer grief, he found her being turned into a statue of gold. He became very shocked at this and prayed to God to take back the destructive blessing. After few moments, the girl came to life. The king became happy.\n"

You've wanted to know about the food habits in Bangladesh. I'm writing to you about them in short. The food habit of the people of one country differs from that of other countries. The Bangladeshis have some 'special' food habits. Usually, we take three meals a day breakfast, lunch and dinner. Rice is our staple food. We are fond of fishes and 'Hilsa' is mostly liked by the people. Traditionally, we are called 'the nation of fish and rice'. Chicken, beef and mutton are also our favourite dishes. People commonly eat rice with vegetables, fish or meat curry and pulses. On occasions, we like to have khichuri, polao and biryani, etc. Tea is the most popular drink in our country. We like to have seasonal fruits. Our favourite fruits come in hundreds of varieties, but jackfruits, mangoes, guavas, papayas and bananas are the most popular. Besides, the Bangladeshis are fond of different kinds of 'pithas' and 'payesh'. Pithas like 'patisapta', 'bhapa', 'chitai' etc. are some of the most favourite ones. They are made on different\noccasions. Most of the people also like to have different types of street foods.\nNo more today. Please, write to me soon about the food habits in the USA.\nLovingly yours,\nNabiha"

The indiscriminate use of pesticides is causing so many problems.\nElijabeth : Absolutely. One of the biggest concern is the impact on human health.\nProthoma : Right. People consuming these crops are at risk of various health issues.\nElijabth : What type of health issues?\nProthoma : Health problems include cancer and neurological problems.\nElijabeth : It has dangerous effect on the . { }^{\\text {. }} . environment too. Isn't it?\nProthoma : Definitely. Pesticides can contaminate the soil and water.\nElijabeth : Not only that, it is also harming wildlife and useful insects. -\nProthoma : Some insects are essential for pollination, and killing them can damage crops and biodiversity.\nElijabeth : And then there's the issue of pesticide resistance. Over time, pests can become resistant to pesticides.\nProthoma : It is even more dangerous, because it makes them less effective. It then leads to the use of even more toxic chemicals.\nElijabeth : It's a vicious cycle. We need to find sustainable alternatives.\nProthoma : Exactly! We should go for nonchemical approaches to control pests. What do you think?\nElijabeth : I agree with you. I believe, such approach will control pests with minimal pesticidè use.\nProthoma : Yes. And promoting organic farming can also help reduce dependency on chemical pesticides.\nElijabeth : Education and awareness are crucial too. Farmers need to be informed about the negative aspects of overuse of pesticides.\nProthoma : Well, I think farmers should be trained in sustainable farming methods.\nElijabeth : Agreed. Also, we need to support policies that promote safe and sustainable agricultural practices.\nProthoma : Absolutely. Reducing pesticide use will benefit not just our health but also the earth."

      "uddipok": "Mother Teresa was moved by the sight of the sick and dying on the streets of Kolkata. She founded a home for the dying destitute and named it \"Nirmal Hriday\", meaning \"Pure Heart\". She and her fellow nuns gathered the dying people of the streets of Kolkata and brought them to this home. They were lovingly looked after and cared for. Since then men, women and children have been taken from the streets and carried to Nirmal Hriday. These unloved and uncared for people get an opportunity to die in an environment of kindness and love. In their last hours they get human and divine love, and can feel they are also children of God. Those who survive, the Missionaries of Charity try to find jobs for them or send them to homes where they can live happily for some more years in a caring environment. Regarding commitment to family, Mother Teresa said, \"May be in our own family, we have somebody, who is feeling lonely, who is feeling sick, who is feeling worried, are we there? Are we willing to give until it hurts in order to be with our families, or do we put our interest first? We must remember that love begins at home and we must also remember that future of humanity passes through the family.\" Mother Teresa's work has been recognised thought the world and she has received a number of awards. These include the Pope John XXIII Peace Prize (1971), the Nehru Prize for Promotion of International Peace and Understanding (1972), the Balzan Prize (1978), the Nobel Peace Prize (1979) and the Bharat Ratna, (1980).
