We can minimise this type of pollution by making less use of motor vehicles and avoiding the use of vehicles older than 20 years. We may also use proper lubricants to lessen the level of emission and pollutants. We can encourage people to use Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) or Liquid Petroleum Gas (LPG) for fuelling their cars.

          "explanation": "Traffic Jam\n\nTraffic jam is a situation in which a long line of vehicles on a road have stopped moving or are moving very slowly. Nowadays, traffic jam is a common problem in our towns and cities. It causes great sufferings to the passengers and the passers-by. The increasing number of vehicles mostly causes traffic jam. Day by day, the number of vehicles is increasing to meet the needs of the increased population. But the roads are not increasing in that proportion. Many vehicles moving on the same road at a timé' cause traffic jąm. Many drivers do not abide by traffic rules. Besides, the traffic police are not sincere. The tendency of the bus drivers and conductors to get more passengers also causes traffic jam. Some drivers stop buses here and there and board and unboard passengers. This hampers the movement of other vehicles and causes traffic jam. The unlimited number of rickshaws plying on the streets is another cause of traffic jam. The general people have to face untold sufferings. They reach late at their working places. Students, employees, businessmen, workers all suffer tremendously for this. It occurs mostly during office and school or college time. During fraffic jam, we feel extremely bored as it kills our valuable time. To relieve the passengers of the sufferings of traffic jam, some steps should be taken by the government. The drivers who do not abide by traffic rules should be punished. Traffic authority should be active to enforce the traffic rules and maintain the discipline on the roads."

One day after coming back home, to her utter surprise, she found a lock hanging on the door. At first, she tried to open the lock with her key, but it did not budge. She knocked on the door, but no one answered. Panic set in, and she wondered what could have happened.\nShe felt alone and scared, but she didn't lose hope. She went to the back of the house to see if there was any way she could get in. Fortunately, one of the windows was open. She somehow managed to get inside. The first thing she noticed was that the house was in complete disarray. She realized that something was terribly wrong.

          "explanation": "Noha: Hey Mahin! I was reading an article yesterday about how mobile phones affect teenagers. It got me thinking—do you think it's more helpful or harmful?\nMahin: Hey Noha! That’s actually a great topic. I think it’s a bit of both. Mobile phones are super helpful for staying connected and accessing information, but they also have their downsides.\nNoha: Totally agree. Like, one of the biggest merits is easy communication. We can call, text, or video chat with friends and family anytime.\nMahin: Yeah, and educational apps and online resources make studying easier too. We can watch tutorials, join online classes, and even do research quickly.\nNoha: Right. But on the flip side, many teens get addicted to social media and games. That really affects their studies and sleep.\nMahin: Exactly. And some even suffer from anxiety or low self-esteem because of comparing themselves to others on social media.\nNoha: Another issue is less face-to-face interaction. I feel like teens are losing social skills because they’re always on their phones.\nMahin: True. Plus, spending too much time staring at screens can cause eye problems and other health issues.\nNoha: But still, if we use mobile phones responsibly, they can be very useful. It’s all about balance, right?\nMahin: Definitely. Using phones wisely can make teenage life easier and more productive, but overuse can lead to serious problems.\nNoha: Well said, Mahin. I think every teen should know both sides before using a phone too much.\nMahin: For sure. Awareness is the first step to using technology in a healthy way"
