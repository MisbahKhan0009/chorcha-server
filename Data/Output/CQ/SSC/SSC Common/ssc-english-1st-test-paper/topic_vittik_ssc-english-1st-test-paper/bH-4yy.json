          "explanation": "(a) Humans can neither change the sun's radiation nor the earth's orbit around the sun, because these things are beyond their control.\n\n(b) Human beings do some unwise activities like burning too much fossil fuels, setting up more factories, cutting down trees indiscriminately, etc. that result in the increase of greenhouse gases. Thus, they are responsible for the increase in the greenhouse gases.\n\n(c) I think the main cause of the increase in carbon dioxide level in the atmosphere is the burning of fossil fuels. With the increase of industrial activities, the combustion of coal has increased. Besides coal, mineral oil and natural gas are also burned for various purposes. Thus, every time a fossil raw material is burned, it releases carbon dioxide into the air.\n\n(d) Enormous areas of forests are destroyed by the people every year to obtain wood and to clear regions for mining and to create pasture."

          "explanation": "a. February 21 is a memorable day in our national history because on this day in 1952, the heroic son's of Bengal laid down their lives to establish Bangla as a state language of the undivided Pakistan. On this day, we pay tribute to the language martyrs because of their sacrifice for the rightful place of mother tongue.\nb. The then Governor General of Pakistan, Mohammad Ali Zinnah, is responsible to raise a storm of protest. In a public meeting in Dhaka, he declared Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan, which disregarded the language rights of the Bangalee. Therefore, a mass protest started across the country.\nc. The Pakistani government banned all sorts of public meetings and gatherings to stop the protest that began following Mohammad Ali Jinnah's declaration of Urdu as the only state language of Pakistan and continued non-stop.\nd. Against the declaration of outlawing all sorts of public meeting and rallies, the students of Dhaka University brought out a peaceful protest procession on 21 February, defying the law.\ne. The Language Movement of 1952 kindled the sparks of independence movement in East Pakistan by making the Bangalees aware of their rights. Thus, the Language Movement is related to the independence movement of Bangladesh."

In the same year, it was also ranked second as the best country brand for natural beauty.\nThe Maldives is well known for being the lowest country in the world. Unfortunately, this small country with idyllic natural beauty is under the threat from rising sea levels due to global warming. Most of the country is just 1.5 metres above sea level with a highest point of 2.3 metres! Many predictions have been made with respect to Maldives being swept away by the rising water level in the Indian Ocean. It was even seen during the tsunami of 2004, that many of the island's dry parts were flooded by waters shrinking the island. The government of the Maldives has begun to purchase land from nearby countries in case the islands go under water! In order to highlight the threats of global warming to its low lying islands, the government of Maldives held a cabinet meeting underwater in 2009. That was the first ever cabinet meeting in the world that took place underwater. The meeting took place about 5 metres underwater, in a blue-green lagoon on a small island. While underwater, the cabinet signed a document calling on all nations to cut their carbon emissions.",

They made him feel that he was 'chosen' and very 'special'.\nOne of his colleagues, Del Yocam said about Steve, \"I think his desire for complete control of whatever he makes derives directly from his personality and from the fact that he was abandoned at birth.\"\nJobs' mother taught him how to read and write before he went to the elementary school. So when he went to school, he found out that he knew everything that the teachers were teaching. He got bored and played pranks to keep himself busy. This continued for the first few years. It was clear from his behaviour that he could not accept other people's authority. He said, \"I encountered authority of a different kind that I have never encountered before, and I did not like it.\"\nA turning point came when he was in grade four. His teacher Imogene Hill watched him very closely for some time and soon found out how to handle him and get things done by him. In order to get things done she used to give him money and food. One day after school, she gave Jobs a workbook with math problems in it. She said, \"I want you to take it home and do this.\" She showed Jobs a huge lollipop and said, \"When you are done with it, if you get it mostly right, I will give you this and five dollars. \"Within two days, Jobs solved the math problem and returned the book to his teacher.\nThis continued for a couple of months and Jobs enjoyed learning so much that he did not need any return. Also he liked his teacher very much and wanted to please her. In Ms. Hill's class, Jobs felt he was special. At the end of the fourth grade, Jobs did very well. It was clear not only to Jobs and his parents but also to the teachers that he was exceptionally intelligent. The school proposed that Jobs should skip two classes and go into the seventh grade. This would mean that Jobs would find the study challenging and he would be motivated to study. His parents had him skip only one grade.",

He was an active worker of the Language Movement. He was one of the ten students to go out in a procession on 21 . February 1952 despite a ban on such activities imposed by the authorities. As a result, he and many others were arrested and taken to prison. Zahir was also present at the historical meeting of Amtala on 21 February 1952. He also took part in the mass movement in 1969. In 1971, he joined the Liberation War.\nAll through his life, Zahir Raihan dreamt of a democratic society, a society that will ensure freedom of speech and will. He had many dreams about our film industry too. He made a legendary film 'Jibon Theke Neya' based on the Language Movement of 1952. It was a revolt against the autocratic government. The family presented in that film was a miniature East Pakistan ruled by an autocrat who had to go to prison for her conspiracy. During the Liberation War, this film was shown outside Bangladesh. Celebrated filmmakers like Satyajit Ray, Mrinal Sen, and Ritwik Ghatak appreciated the film. Zahir gave all the money to the Freedom Fighters' trust that he get from his film shows. Besides, his great documentary on Pakistani atrocities, 'Stop Genocide', helped create world sentiment in favour of our liberation war.\nOn 30 December 1971, someone informed Zahir about an address somewhere at Mirpur, where he might find his brother, the famous writer Shahidullah Kaiser. Shahidullah was captured and killed by the Pakistani army and the local collaborators during the last days of the war. Accordingly, Zahir left home to get his brother back but he never returned. Zahir's dream was fulfilled. He could see the inception of a free independent Bangladesh though he did not get back his brother. And it's a pity that this dreamer was missing at such a time when his dream came true.",

How much would you love it if you were placed in a store full of flowers the whole day? I'm just going to give you some clues about such a job which can also be a business. Yes. Daisies, violets, tulips, marigolds, dahlias, lilies, jasmines, roses and all those things of beauty can also earn you a living if you handle them professionally. If you start such a profession you will be called a florist. A florist's career is a good choice as an unconventional job for many around the world. Wherever you see eye-catching floral displays, you actually see the professional performance of a floral designer. Using both real and artificial flowers with other greeneries. florists prepare flower displays for a variety of a events such as weddings, birthdays, anniversaries, valentine's day, official receptions and even funerals. Every flower comes with its distinct colour design, value and meaning which flower designers have to know well. There are conventions and meanings associated with flowers. We know that conventionally roses are meant for romance and marriage anniversaries and tulips for birthdays.\nAlthough formal education or a diploma is not always essential for florists, they must have good taste, a good eye for colours, shapes and proportion. They have to have good sense for selecting flowers, ribbons and other accessories to make beautiful arrangements. Professional florists are knowledgeable about not only flowers but also designs and techniques. Most florists learn the trade mainly through apprenticeship in a previous flower farming job and also attending formal schools and courses. However, a true passion for flowers and a bit of aesthetic senses are all that can make a florist a career successful.\nFlower designers earn fairly handsome money. But the bonus is that they work in a fresh and beautiful environment which their clients also enjoy. They work with flowers all day long in a pleasant and fragrant atmosphere with vivid colours around. But there is a disadvantage too, if you are inclined to see so. Florists deal with flowers, but miss their honey!",

Here are some suggestions.\nREDUCE!\nReally, the best thing we can do for the planet is to use its resources properly. Our unplanned activities are mainly responsible for the environmental crisis. Here are some questions you can ask yourself before buying something, \"Do 1 really need this?\" or \"Is there another product which would do the same thing but more sustainable?\" Or ask the question, \"Will this last a long time?\" Some other questions may be, \"Do I know how this item was made, how it will be used and how it will be disposed of?\"\nREUSE!\nWhat do you think of using your own ceramic cup or mug at your school or local club? It means there are no plastic cups to throw away. You can wash it and reuse it every day. Unfortunately, we are encouraged to buy a new \"improved\" item even if the one we have can be repaired or reused. When we buy things, we should buy those that are durable; we should use them properly, and have them repaired when necessary. If we practise this, many things will not only last a life-time, but also be passed on for future use. However, if something is truly unusable for its original purposes, try to be more creative and think of how else it might be used. When you're done with it, think of whether someone else might be able to use it. You can donate some of the things to the poor. You may also sell some of your used items through personal advertisements in a local newspaper or in social media.\nRECYCLE!\nRather than throwing an item out when neither you nor anyone else can make use of it, have it recycled. And if recycling is not possible, it is better to send goods to a landfill or have them burned up. Find out what types of materials can be recycled in your area. Clean and sort the materials before putting them out in the bin. Recycling your drink and food cans means there will be less trash in a resource recovery facility or landfill. Moreover, a company can use the old cans to make new ones.",

She founded a home for the dying destitute and named it \"Nirmal Hriday\", meaning \"Pure Heart\". She and her fellow nuns gathered the dying people of the streets of Kolkata and brought them to this home. They were lovingly looked after and cared for. Since then men, women and children have been taken from the streets and carried to Nirmal Hriday. These unloved and uncared for people get an opportunity to die in an environment of kindness and love. In their last hours they get human and divine love, and can feel they are also children of God. Those who survive, the Missionaries of Charity try to find jobs for them or send them to homes where they can live happily for some more years in a caring environment. Regarding commitment to family, Mother Teresa said, \"May be in our own family, we have somebody, who is feeling lonely, who is feeling sick, who is feeling worried, are we there? Are we willing to give until it hurts in order to be with our families, or do we put our interest first? We must remember that love begins at home and we must also remember that future of humanity passes through the family.\" Mother Teresa's work has been recognised thought the world and she has received a number of awards. These include the Pope John XXIII Peace Prize (1971), the Nehru Prize for Promotion of International Peace and Understanding (1972), the Balzan Prize (1978), the Nobel Peace Prize (1979) and the Bharat Ratna, (1980). Mother Teresa died at the age of 87, on 5 September 1997. The world salutes her for her love and compassion for humanity. She has taught us how to extend our hand towards those who need our love and support irrespective of creed, caste and religion.

He pointed out that the era of wood and bio-mass has almost come to an end. The age of oil and natural gas would soon be over within the next few decades. Massive burning of world's coal reserves may lead to a worldwide ecological disaster because coal burning emits the highest amount of carbon in the atmosphere. So according to Kalam, the only solution that mankind can look to is the massive use of solar energy in future because it has some advantages over other forms of renewable energies. Now why has Kalam put so much importance to the issue of energy? The energy sources have always been a major factor of change throughout history. The world's petroleum consumption has increased from 3 billion barrels annually in 1930 to 37 billion barrels annually today. In the next quarter century, the world's population is expected to be about 8 billion which is 30 percent higher than today. Developing countries will grow their economics about two times faster than industrialised countries. Global economic growth is expected to continue at 3 percent per year. Consequently, the global demand for energy will grow at about 1.7 percent per year on an average. It indicates a 50 percent rise of energy consumption by 2030. If the world's daily petroleum consumption is 100 million barrels now, it will rise to 150 million barrels by that time. The present reserve of hydro-carbon energy resources is limited and it will not be sufficient to meet the future energy challenges of the world. And hence, leading industrial countries have taken initiatives to tap alternative energy sources mainly known as green or renewable energy sources. The bottom line of Kalam's speech indicates concern of mankind in 21 st century.\n\nMr. APJ Abdul Kalam was not only a scientist but also the President of India. At the 90 th 90^{\\text {th }} 9 0 th science congress, he (a)____ a speech on the aspect of mankind's future energy crisis. He (b)____ pressure on the (c) ____ of solar energy.

The sun is hardly visible. Gusty wind blows from all sides. Birds keep standing on branches of trees or keep quiet in their nests. Cattle remain in their sheds and bellow for the fodder. Water stands here and there. Unpitched roads become muddy and slippery. Passers-by have to walk with umbrella over their head, shoes in hand and pants folded up to the knee. Sometimes people slip and fall on the muddy road. In cities, a rainy day is now a horror. The roads and streets in some towns and cities get flooded. Vehicles are seen stranding in knee-deep water in some areas due to water clogging. It causes gridlock across the city. It is a day of trouble and annoyance to the office-going people. They have to suffer from yarious inconveniences. But for the school going children, it is a delight to have a rainy day. If it rains heavily before their school time, they get a holiday. Sometimes, children, especially the boys play football in the rainwater in the nearby fields. A rainy day is a curse for the poor. The day labourers cannot go out for work and hence, they have to suffer a lot. However, I pass the day by listening to music, watching TV or reading journals.

A farmer’s day begins early, often before dawn, as he tends to his fields or animals, working long hours under varying weather conditions. The life of a farmer is simple yet demanding, requiring hard physical labor, patience, and a deep understanding of nature and the seasons. Farmers play a crucial role in the nation's economy by producing food, contributing to rural development, and ensuring food security for the population. Their hard work supports entire industries, from agriculture to transportation and retail. To improve the condition of farmers, it is essential to provide them with better access to modern farming techniques, financial support, fair market prices for their produce, and improved infrastructure for irrigation, transportation, and storage. Additionally, reducing the burden of debt and offering educational resources can empower farmers to thrive in their profession."

There is dense fog everywhere. Sometimes, the fog is so dense that the sun-rays cannot get through it. Everything looks hazy. The scenery of a winter morning is really charming in rural areas. Dewdrops on grass and leaves sparkle like pearls in the sunrays. Generally, people wake up late in the morning. They shiver in cold. They wear warm clothes. Old people and children are found basking in the morning sun. People usually have date juice and various native 'pithas' as breakfast. Cattle remain in their sheds. However, in cities, a winter morning does not make much change in life as it is not too cold there. People wake up at their usual time, wear colourful warm clothes and go to their work place. Students are seen in the most colourful warm clothes. The nature is dull and gloomy here, too. Both in rural and urban areas, poor people are the worst sufferers. They do not have enough warm clothes to protect themselves from the biting cold. Street children gather straw and papers and make fire to warm themselves. The communication system is disrupted which causes much hardship to the people. However, the scenery of a winter morning is very transitory. It starts disappearing as the day advances. My personal feeling about a winter morning is that it is a bane for the poor, but a boon for the rich."

They give us shade and soothe our eyes with their green colour. They give us various kinds of fruits. They give us firewood as fuel for cooking. They give us timber for furniture, doors and windows, boats, electric poles, railway slippers, etc. They give us rubber too. Trees take in carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. Sufficient trees cause sufficient rainfall and prevent draught. Trees along the roadside and coastal areas preyent erosion and tidal bore. But many inconsiderate pcople are cutting down trees for their selfish interests. So, we are losing trees. If there is no tree, there will be no civilization. In fact, the loss of trees will take our existence to the verge of extinction. The earth will be no more habitable. Hence, tree plantation must be taken as a project. The more we plant trees, the morė our environment will be balanced and greener. In Bangladesh, tree plantation is compulsory because we do not have as much forest as we require to maintain the ecological balance. There is no specific time to plant trees. We can plant trees any time of the year based on the type of the trees. Park, yard, urban areas, open field, balcony, rooftops; roadside places, etc. are best places to plant trees. To make life peaceful, there is no alternative to tree plantation."

But when they are polluted and their essential balance is disrupted, this phenomenon is known as environmental pollution. Nowadays, almost everywhere, the environment is being seriously polluted.

Industries and factories emit huge amount of smoke, gases and fume. Motor vehicles also emit large amount of smoke and gases. All these pollute air seriously and polluted air is very harmful for us. Moreover, water is polluted due to dumping of industrial wastes and by chemical fertilizers and insecticides which are washed away into rivers and canals. Due to indiscriminate use of vehicle horns, loud speakers, mikes, etc. sound is polluted. Soil is polluted by harmful chemical fertilizers and insecticides. Besides, people are cutting down trees at random. All these are causing environmental pollution.

It is usually decorated with chairs, tables and benches. People go to a tea stall usually to take a cup of tea to remove their tiredness. A tea stall is kept open from early morning till late night. In a tea stall there are 'generally two people to manage and run it. One is a grown up man who prepares tea and takes bill from the customers, and the other is a young boy who serves tea, biscuits, etc. to the customers.

Coronavirus primarily spreads through physical contact and, respiratory droplets. People with COVID-19 may have a wide range of symptoms. These may appear two to fourteen days after exposure to the virus.

Older people and those with underlying medical problems such as heart disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease and cancer are more likely to develop serious illnesses. Scientists around the world have invented some vaccines to boost our immune system for fighting coronavirus. Some of them are AstraZeneca, 'Pfizer. Moderna, Sinopharm, Sinovac, Sputnik V, etc. Though Bangladesh has invented a vaccine named Bangavax. , it is yet to be applied to human bodies. Besides, Molnupiravir, the first oral medicine for COVID-19. is now available in several countries. Still, preventive measures are the best ways to stay safe from COVID19. While going out, we must wear masks to cover our noses and mouth. We should thoroughly and regularly clean our hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. We should avoid touching the face, nose and eyes as the virus can enter our body through them. Moreover, while sneezing or coughing, we should cover our face and nose with a tissue or with the elbow. In addition to that, we should maintain a social distance of a minimum of 3 feet. Anyone with the possible symptoms must be isolated to avoid close contact with others. Therefore, staying safe from COVID-19 mostly depends on personal hygiene."

It features a simple yet striking design: a red circle set slightly toward the hoist on a green rectangular field. The green background represents the lush greenery of Bangladesh, symbolizing the fertility, youth, and vitality of its land. The red circle signifies the rising sun and the blood of those who sacrificed their lives for the nation’s independence during the Liberation War of 1971. The flag’s design was first conceived during the early stages of the independence movement and was officially adopted on January 17, 1972. The flag reflects the country's struggle for freedom and its commitment to progress and peace. The red and green colors hold deep emotional significance for the people of Bangladesh, reminding them of their hard-won sovereignty and the resilience of their nation.\nThe national flag is prominently displayed on government buildings, schools, and public spaces during national holidays and celebrations such as Independence Day and Victory Day. It inspires a sense of unity and patriotism among the citizens. For the people of Bangladesh, their flag is not just a piece of cloth but a living symbol of their history, culture, and aspirations for a prosperous future."

This fact, when made into a regular habit, will surely lead us to a world of bliss and prosperity. A proverb says, \"Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.\" Early rising has many benefits. The man who rises early in the morning can take some exercises or a walk in the fresh air by the riverside or in the open field. It makes our minds fresh and lively. Early in the morning, nature seems quiet and calm. No hue and cry are heard then. Nature smiles in the morning with colourful flowers and green leaves. Birds begin to chirp. These beautiful gifts and colourful nature in the morning remind everybody of the Creator. One feels like praying to the Almighty: But it is not easy to attain this quality. Sleeping late at night does not help in early rising. So, to rise early from bed, we have to go to bed early. An early riser enjoys the surroundings very much and gets enough time to do his work either in study or in other work, which will bring him success. On the contrary, if one gets up late, the schedule of his work becomes interrupted. Above all, early rising keeps us healthy and cheerful. For all these reasons, we all should cultivate the habit of early rising."

At present, there is hardly any person who doesn't have a smartphone. Smart phone has enabled' us to communicate with the people of the whole world in an instant. It has facilitated our life to a great extent. But alongside the huge number of benefits that we get from smart phone, it also brings about some troubles in our life. Access to huge number of data across the world through internet is a great threat to our creativity. It has also minimized our thirst for exploring the realm of knowledge that we are supposed to gain by participating physically in different expeditions. The smart phone has also expedited different kinds of cybercrimes. Many people, especially of young age, remain unnecessarily busy with browsing internet. Some people ate so obsessed in using internet that they behave in abnormal way. They cannot do much work in time due to wasting time in social media. To get rid of the abuses of smartphone, maintaining a strict schedule of work and increasing real life communication are effective ways. Besides, the parents should keep their children in close observation about their smart phone related activities. The government should adopt cybercrime law strictly to control abuses of smartphone. Thus, we all should control and be aware of the bad effects of smart phone."

It is a common problem in developing countries like Bangladesh. The primary causes of load shedding include a massive gap between the production and demand for electricity, system loss, illegal connections, and the shortage of fuel needed for power plants.\nIt hampers our daily life in numerous ways. Students cannot study properly at night, especially during exams. In hospitals, it affects critical surgeries and the operation of life-saving equipment. Furthermore, industrial production is severely disrupted, causing huge financial losses for the country. To solve this chronic problem, the government should take immediate steps to establish more power plants and upgrade the existing ones.

The rickshawpuller was able to jump fróm his seat but the boy and his mother fell on the street. The boy and his mother were seriously wounded. I rushed to them. Some other passers-by also came forward to help them. We led them to a nearby doctor's chamber. I felt pity for the school boy, he was of my age.

The causes of climate change can be divided into two categories. They are due to natural causes and the causes created by men. Global warming is the main natural cause while using harmful chemicals in everyday life is the main cause created by man. The climate is changing rapidly that results in the rise of average temperature of the earth. The global climate changes and its consequences are leaving a bad impact on the developing countries like Bangladesh. The serious consequences of climate change are rising of temperature, erratic rainfall, floods, cyclones, draught, melting of polar ice-caps etc. which seriously affect the livings of the people of poorer countries. Bangladesh, for its geographical location, is likely to be the most affected. The developed nations which are more responsible for such climate changes should take responsibilities to protect the victimized countries. A one-meter rising of sea-level will submerge about one-third of the total area of Bangladesh which will uproot 25 − 30 25-30 25 − 30 million people of the country. These people will become refugees. To minimize the climate change, people should be aware. Tree plantation can reduce global warming. Avoiding the usage of harmful chemicals can reduce environmental pollution. Students should take necessary steps to protect the environment and raise awareness. They can make people aware of the bad sides of climate change. Thus, they can play a vital role to minimize the climate change."

Day by day, the number of vehicles is increasing to meet the needs of the increased population. But the roads are not increasing in that proportion. Many vehicles moving on the same road at a timé' cause traffic jąm. Many drivers do not abide by traffic rules. Besides, the traffic police are not sincere. The tendency of the bus drivers and conductors to get more passengers also causes traffic jam. Some drivers stop buses here and there and board and unboard passengers. This hampers the movement of other vehicles and causes traffic jam. The unlimited number of rickshaws plying on the streets is another cause of traffic jam. The general people have to face untold sufferings. They reach late at their working places. Students, employees, businessmen, workers all suffer tremendously for this. It occurs mostly during office and school or college time. During fraffic jam, we feel extremely bored as it kills our valuable time.

Drug addiction has grasped the young generation in our country. The people who take the drug cannot stop taking it. There are some reasons behind this addiction. Some take drugs to forget their painful past or present. Some take drugs in pursuit of pleasure. Some people, at first, take a drug as fun but afterwards, it turns into an addiction for them. The aftereffects of drug addiction are very harmful and serious. The health of the addicts breaks down. They lose their mental and physical power. They lose their social status and the love of their nearer and dearer ones as well. Everybody dislikes or hates them. Various kinds of diseases attack them. They suffer from amnesia, insomnia, nausea, physical weakness, blood pressure and from many other critical diseases. Their lungs, kidneys and livers are also damaged. Drugs are very expensive. So, the addicts often go for stealing, hijacking, killing and all sorts of misdeeds to manage money. For this reason, it should be stopped at any cost. Addiction to drugs can be checked by creating social awareness. The mass media can play an effective role in this regard.

The prices of essential commodities are increasing by leaps and bounds. Indeed, price of daily commodities has gone beyond the reach of the common people. There are many causes of price hike. Insufficient supply of daily commodities is mainly responsible for price hike. Our population is increasing rapidly, but our food production is not increasing proportionately. For this, we do not get enough food in comparison to our increasing demands. Moreover, frequent natural disasters like flood, drought, cyclone, etc. hamper our food production, which accelerates the price hike of essential food items. On the other hand, hoarding is another important factor of soaring price level. Some dishonest traders devoid of morality hoard essential goods and create artificial shortage in the market. Then they sell the goods at higher price. Political unrest like strikes is also responsible for a surge in price. Lack of market supervision, black marketing and smuggling also contribute to price hike. The phenomenon has increased the suffering of the common people. The poor and the middle class are mostly affected by it. But, the worst sufferers of it are those who live from hand to mouth. They find it hard to feed their family members. Some of them remain half- fed. As a result, they suffer from malnutrition. Unusual price hike hampers the economic balance of a country. The government should take effective steps to tackle the situation, most notably by increasing food production. Each and every shop must have a price chart fixed by the government. The law enforcing agencies should be deployed in the market places to monitor the market price, Legal actions must be taken against the dishonest businessmen and hoarders. Actually, people of all walks of life should also co- operate with the government."

Last night, at 12:30 am when the electricity went off for a long time, I decided to spend some time on the terrace. I went there and after some time, I felt like someone was following me though I could not see anyone and a cold sweating grasped me. I got frightened when my phone rang. It was an unknown number. I thought it might be an emergency or something scary to me. My father was out on an official tour and suddenly it came to my mind that something might have happened to him. I received the call and asked who it was. No one replied but I heard that someone heaved a deep sigh.\nIt made me more scared and I repeated the same question. But the result was same; no one replied. After six or seven minutes, suddenly someone burst into laughter and hung up the phone. I was utterly horrified and confused. That incident made me so disturbed that I couldn't even concentrate on my studies anymore after coming downstairs. The next day, after finishing the exam, I came across a neighbour who revealed that he played a prank on me last night. He was just walking a little far from me on the opposite section of terrace and was trying to frighten me. I was so shocked that I asked for a reasonable answer. He told that he loved to play pranks on others but he meant no harm. I advised him not to do that again. All of us must be careful about our actions and shouldn't do anything which hampers the peace of others' minds.\n"

Finally, while begging at a bus stop, he met Kashem Ali, the owner of the workshop. That night Falu was starving, and was crying helplessly. At that miserable hour, God sent Kashem Ali in his aid. Kashem was a compassionate man and Falu's extreme miseries moved him much. He offered Falu a job at his workshop. And now, Falu was thankful to have a shelter and food to eat. Kashem Ali told him that he could start school from. next year. Falu looked dreamy; he was thinking about a better future. Talha, on the other hand, being greatly moved by the touching story of Falu's life, thanked God for all the privileges bestowed on him. Life is after all an adventure!"

The mouse scurried away, thankful for the lion's mercy.\nA few days later, the lion was caught in a hunter's net while prowling through the forest. Struggling to free himself, the lion roared in frustration, shaking the entire jungle. Hearing the loud roars, the mouse hurried to the scene. Recognizing the lion, the mouse said, \"Don't worry, I will help you.\"\nThe little mouse began gnawing at the thick ropes of the net with its sharp teeth. Slowly but surely, the net weakened and broke, setting the lion free. Grateful, the lion said, \"I underestimated you, little friend.

          "explanation": "The Honest Woodcutter\nOnce there lived a poor woodcutter in a village near a jungle. He used to cut woods from the forest and sell it in the market. But one day, while cutting wood, his axe slipped from his hand and fell into a deep river nearby. The woodcutter became very sad because it was the only axe he had, and he could not afford a new one.\nHe sat on the riverbank and started crying. Suddenly, a kind fairy appeared from the water and asked him why he was crying. The woodcutter told her everything. The fairy dived into the river and came up with a golden axe . “Is this yours?” she asked. The woodcutter said, “No, this is not mine.”\nThen she brought a silver axe and asked the same question. Again, the woodcutter replied, “No, that’s not mine either.” Finally, she brought his old iron axe , and he happily said, “Yes! That one is mine!”\nThe fairy was very pleased with his honesty and gave him all three axes as a reward. The woodcutter went home joyfully and lived happily ever after. His honesty brought him unexpected blessings."

As his common feature of character, he asked the boatman if he knew the rules of high and low tide. Telling nothing, the helpless boatman only gazed and gazed. The scholar smirked and remarked, “Half your life is wasted if you do not even know something so simple.”\nAfter a while, the scholar asked the boatman another question. “Do you know the principles of astronomy?” Again, the boatman stayed silent, shaking his head in ignorance. The scholar laughed mockingly, saying, “Then three-quarters of your life is wasted.”\nAs they were conversing, the sky began to darken, and storm clouds gathered above. The boat began to rock violently in the growing waves. Fear gripped both the boatman and the scholar.\nThe boatman then asked calmly, “Sir, do you know how to swim?” The scholar’s face turned pale as he stuttered, “N-no, I do not.”\nThe boatman then smiled and said, “I may not know astronomy or tides, but it seems your entire life is at risk now.” As the boat capsized in the raging storm, the humble boatman swam to safety while the self-proclaimed scholar struggled and cried for help.\nThis event taught the scholar that practical knowledge is just as important as theoretical knowledge, if not more."

Some of my friends proposed that we should go on a journey by boat. We fixed a date and a destination. We hired a boat for the day. We set out early in the morning and enjoyed the tranquil river, as the sunrise created a golden hue on the water. Along.the way, we were mesimerized by the breathtaking sights of small villages, children waving and shouting 'hello', fishermen casting their nets, and women washing clothes in the river. We felt grateful to experience it together and enjoy nature's offerings.\nAround 11 a.m., we arrived at our destination, a small island in the middle of the river covered in lush greenery. We spent the next few hours exploring the island walking on foot, swimming in the river, and enjoying a pleasant picnic with the packed lunch we brought with us. Eventually, we'set out for the return journey, which was equally enjoyable."

The nobleman could not recognize him and did not behave well with him. On the next day, Sheikh Saadi left the place for the court of the king and was received with honour. He stayed there for a few days and received rich gifts from the king. On his way back to home, he again visited that rich man's house wearing a costly and gorgeous dress. This time, the rich man treated him with the best of the foods and comfort. While eating, he was surprised to see the rich delicious food and understood the rich man's attitude. Sheikh Saadi then instead of eating the food, started putting them into the pockets of his rich cloth. Being astonished, the rich man asked him about his mysterious\nbehaviour. The poet answered that the given food was for his dress as he failed to get same treatment when he was in very simple dress. The rich man realized his earlier folly and became ashamed."

So, the mayor hired the stranger and promised him a thousand gold coins if he succeeded. Being satisfied with the offer, the pied piper started to play his pipe and walked through the streets of Hamelin. The sweet melody of the pipe brought the rats out in the street and had them trail behind the pied piper. The man cunningly brought the rats near the river and each of them was washed away with its strong current. Then he returned to the mayor to get his pay, but the mayor went back on his words. Enraged by the dishonesty, the stranger started playing his piep again and this time he lured out all the children from their homes. The children trailed behind him and he disappeared from the town with them for ever."

Rimi's heart sank seeing the little girl in distress and she let her in. After taking care of the girl, Rimi asked what had happened to her. The girl took a while to get back to a composed state and slowly started talking. She along with her mother just arrived in Dhaka to visit her sick father. When they arrived at Sadarghat, the little girl lost her mother in the crowd. Since then, she had been looking for her mother and out of exhaustion, decided to seek shelter where Rimi lived. Rimi felt pity for the little girl. When Rimi's parents returned home, Rimi told them about the little girl's miserable condition. So, they all went to the nearby police station and asked the officers to help find the girl's parents. The police assured that they would take care of the girl and then they took her in their custody. After being confirmed that the police would inform Rimi's parents if the girl could be reunited' with her parents, they left the police station. Two days later, the police inspector called Rimi's father saying that they found the girl's parents. Finally, Rimi felt relieved that the girl was then in safe hands."

The Bangladeshis have some 'special' food habits. Usually, we take three meals a day breakfast, lunch and dinner. Rice is our staple food. We are fond of fishes and 'Hilsa' is mostly liked by the people. Traditionally, we are called 'the nation of fish and rice'. Chicken, beef and mutton are also our favourite dishes. People commonly eat rice with vegetables, fish or meat curry and pulses. On occasions, we like to have khichuri, polao and biryani, etc. Tea is the most popular drink in our country. We like to have seasonal fruits. Our favourite fruits come in hundreds of varieties, but jackfruits, mangoes, guavas, papayas and bananas are the most popular. Besides, the Bangladeshis are fond of different kinds of 'pithas' and 'payesh'. Pithas like 'patisapta', 'bhapa', 'chitai' etc. are some of the most favourite ones. They are made on different\noccasions. Most of the people also like to have different types of street foods.\nNo more today.

I received your message and your concern about the frequent road accidents in Bangladesh. It’s definitely an issue that’s causing a lot of distress here, and I appreciate that you care about it.\nThe main causes of road accidents in Bangladesh are numerous, and many of them stem from both human errors and infrastructure-related issues. One of the primary causes is reckless driving, which includes speeding, overtaking dangerously, and not following traffic rules. There’s also the issue of poor road conditions in many areas—potholes, lack of proper signage, and narrow lanes make driving hazardous. The absence of proper pedestrian crossings and traffic lights in certain areas also adds to the problem.\nAnother factor is the increasing number of vehicles on the roads, which has led to congestion and drivers sometimes feeling impatient. Many drivers don’t respect traffic signals or signs, and there is a lack of proper enforcement of laws, which makes things worse. Poor visibility at night due to a lack of streetlights and the use of mobile phones while driving are also significant contributors.\nThe effects of these accidents are devastating. Loss of life is the most tragic impact, with thousands of families affected each year. Those who survive often suffer from serious injuries, many of which require long-term treatment or result in permanent disabilities. Apart from the human cost, the economic impact is also severe. The government and families bear the medical and rehabilitation expenses, and accidents often cause traffic jams that affect daily life and productivity.\nIt’s clear that urgent action is needed, from improving road infrastructure to better enforcement of traffic laws and educating the public about road safety. There’s also a need for stricter penalties for those who break the law and more investment in public transportation to reduce the number of cars on the road.\nI hope this gives you a clearer picture of the situation. Let’s hope that over time, things will improve as more attention is given to this issue.\nTake care, and keep in touch!\nWarm regards, Arpita Chattogram, Bangladesh\n"

We can take long walks by the river, explore the countryside, and enjoy delicious homemade food prepared by my grandmother.\nThere’s also a fair happening in the village during the last week of the vacation, and I’ve heard it’s going to be a grand event. We can take part in various activities, meet the villagers, and even go fishing or boating in the nearby pond. I’m sure you’ll find it a delightful experience!\nLet me know as soon as you can if you’re able to join me so I can make the necessary arrangements. I’m really looking forward to spending this vacation with you and creating memories we’ll cherish forever.\nTake care and do write back soon!\nWarm regards, Rohan"

Today, I would like to describe a train journey that I undertook recently.\nA few days ago, I along with my parents made a journey by train from Dhaka to Mymensingh. On the day of journey, we reached Kamalapur Railway Station very early in the morning. The station was very crowded. The Tista Express was waiting for its passengers parked on platform no. 4. We boarded the train and took our seats. I chose a window seat. At 7.30 a.m, the train blew its whistle and we started moving slowly. After a few minutes, it gained speed. Soon, we left the crowded city and entered the country side. We were passing through the green fields. The farmers were ploughing the fields and taking care of the crops. Shepherds were grazing cattle in the fields. Many children were busy playing in the field and making faces at us. Women were washing clothes and taking bath in the ponds. As the train was moving, the trees seemed running backwards. Everything was coming to sight quite fast and then disappearing even faster. The sun was trying to peep through the clouds. Indeed, the scenery was very charming. We passed by many small and big towns. The train finally reached Mymensingh at 10:20 a.m. We got down from the train and saw my uncle and cousins waiting at the station. They were very happy to see us. Truly, it was a pleasant journey by train. I still cherish the memory of the journey in my mind.\nPlease convey my greetings to aunty, uncle and your little brother Pranto.\n\nYour best friend,\nSamia/ Sayeem"

One of the most significant advantages of learning computer is that it opens up many job opportunities. These days, almost all jobs require computer skills, and having this knowledge can give you an edge in the job market. But that's not all. Knowing how to use a computer can also make you more productive and efficient, which is helpful in any work environment. It can also help with education, as computers are used for research, writing, and online learning. Having computer skills can make studying and learning much easier and efficient. Besides, computer skills can help you communicate with people from all around the world. With the internet, you can connect with anyone, anywhere.

However, I recently heard about your habit of smoking cigarettes, and I felt it was important to reach out to you.\nHasan, I understand that smoking may seem harmless at first, but it poses significant risks to your health. Cigarette smoke contains harmful chemicals like nicotine, tar, and carbon monoxide, which can damage your lungs and heart over time. Prolonged smoking increases the chances of developing life-threatening illnesses such as lung cancer, heart disease, and respiratory disorders.\nMoreover, smoking doesn’t just harm you; it can also affect those around you. Second-hand smoke can be equally harmful to your family and friends, especially children and the elderly.\nI know breaking a habit like this is challenging, but with determination and the right support, you can do it. There are many effective methods to quit smoking, such as counseling, nicotine replacement therapy, or even joining a support group. Please take a step towards a healthier life.\nYour well-being matters to me, and I hope you will seriously consider this. Let’s meet soon—I’m always here to support you through any difficulty.\nTake care and stay safe.\nWarm regards, Rupak 17 Broad Lane Chattogram"

It was a jaw-dropping experience when we entered the historical Panam city. We all were impressed by the serene sight. I personally felt as if we had been walking through the history book. The spooky but enchanting ancient doors of the buildings around us boggled our mind. We took-many photographs. Some of the members got busy taking selfie using their smart phones. We also took group photographs. One of the most interesting aspects of the tour was a brief class lecture by our teachers while we-were inspecting the architecture of the ancient buildings. We learned that those historical buildings were built centuries ago and are related with the history of Baro Bhuiyan. As the capital of the 15 th 15^{\\text {th }} 1 5 th century Bengal ruler Isa Khan; Sonargaon showcases the architecture of the Sultanates, Mughal and colonial periods.

On this occasion, our school auditorium was brightly decorated. Prizes were also neatly displayed on a separate table on the dais. All the students were present at the function. Among others, the guardians and some eminent persons of the locality also attended the function. The principal of PN College was the chief guest. The function started on time - just at 4 p.m. Our Headteacher first read out the annual report. Then the Chief Guest gave a short speech. He highly praised the overall performance of the school and its excellent SSC Exam results. Then he gave away the prizes among the students for their outstanding activities. You will be glad to know that I've got two prizes - one for regular attendance and the other for good results in the last year-ending exams.\n\nThanking you, Amin"

As our exam is knocking at the door, I want to share some tips on how you can do well in the exam.\nFirst, make a study plan. Divide your subjects based on the topics and set achievable goals for each day. This will help you stay organized and cover all the topics including the ones, which seem difficult to you. Be regular in classes and attentive to the teachers' lessons. Keep notes of the classes. Read the textbooks thoroughly and try to solve the problems. Next, practise previous years' exam papers. This will give you a clear idea of the question patterns and time management. Besides, it can boost your confidence. Don't forget to take regular breaks while studying. Short breaks can help you stay focused and fresh. Try using the Pomodoro technique-study for 25 minutes, then take a 5 -minute break. Stay healthy. Get enough sleep, eat well, and stay hydrated. Remember, a healthy body supports a healthy mind. Lastly, stay positive. Believe in yourself and your abilities. Stressing too much won't help, so try to stay calm and focused.\nI'm confident that you will do.great. Let me know if you need any more tips or if you want to study together:\nBest of luck!\nYour friend,\nAmrin"

I'll start working on these right away.\nMyself : You're most welcome, Sabiha! Just remember, consistency is the key. Keep practicing, and you'll see improvement over time."

But can you tell me the causes of frequent road accidents across the country?\n\nTamal : The causes are manifold. Reckless driving, lack of skilled traffic police, ignorance of the drivers, tendency of overtaking, violation of traffic signals and rules, etc. contribute greatly to the frequent road accidents.\n\nJamal : You are absolutely right. The conditions of roads are extremely poor. These are also causing many road accidents.\n\nTamal : Right! Immediate steps should be taken to reduce road accidents. What do you think?\n\nJamal : Yes, of course. Strict laws should be introduced in this regard. Illiterate and careless drivers should be identified and their driving licenses should be cancelled.\n\nTamal : Certainly! Besides, drivers should be given proper training and the Roads and Highways Department should be more cautious in this regard.\n\nJamal : Absolutely!

That’s actually a great topic. I think it’s a bit of both. Mobile phones are super helpful for staying connected and accessing information, but they also have their downsides.\nNoha: Totally agree. Like, one of the biggest merits is easy communication. We can call, text, or video chat with friends and family anytime.\nMahin: Yeah, and educational apps and online resources make studying easier too. We can watch tutorials, join online classes, and even do research quickly.\nNoha: Right. But on the flip side, many teens get addicted to social media and games. That really affects their studies and sleep.\nMahin: Exactly. And some even suffer from anxiety or low self-esteem because of comparing themselves to others on social media.\nNoha: Another issue is less face-to-face interaction. I feel like teens are losing social skills because they’re always on their phones.\nMahin: True. Plus, spending too much time staring at screens can cause eye problems and other health issues.\nNoha: But still, if we use mobile phones responsibly, they can be very useful. It’s all about balance, right?\nMahin: Definitely. Using phones wisely can make teenage life easier and more productive, but overuse can lead to serious problems.\nNoha: Well said, Mahin. I think every teen should know both sides before using a phone too much.\nMahin: For sure. Awareness is the first step to using technology in a healthy way"

It's heartbreaking to see so many trees gone. But why do you think it's such a big deal?\nTamal: Deforestation is a serious problem, Asif. Cutting down trees at this rate is harmful to the environment. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen. Without them, the air becomes more polluted.\nAsif: Oh, I see. But I suppose we need land for housing and farming too, right?\nTamal: That’s true, but we need to strike a balance. Deforestation leads to soil erosion and loss of fertile land. It also destroys wildlife habitats, forcing animals to move or go extinct.\nAsif: I didn’t think of that. So deforestation affects both the land and the animals?\nTamal: Exactly! It also contributes to climate change. Without enough trees, carbon dioxide builds up in the atmosphere, causing global warming.\nAsif: That’s terrible! Is there anything we can do to stop it?\nTamal: Definitely. People need to be more aware of the consequences and plant more trees. Governments should enforce laws to regulate deforestation and promote sustainable practices.\nAsif: You’re right. I think we should also spread awareness in our community about the importance of saving trees.\nTamal: Great idea, Asif! If we all do our part, we can make a difference. Let’s start today.\nAsif: Absolutely! Thanks for bringing this up, Tamal. It’s a wake-up call."

Isn't it?\nProthoma : Definitely. Pesticides can contaminate the soil and water.\nElijabeth : Not only that, it is also harming wildlife and useful insects. -\nProthoma : Some insects are essential for pollination, and killing them can damage crops and biodiversity.\nElijabeth : And then there's the issue of pesticide resistance. Over time, pests can become resistant to pesticides.\nProthoma : It is even more dangerous, because it makes them less effective. It then leads to the use of even more toxic chemicals.\nElijabeth : It's a vicious cycle. We need to find sustainable alternatives.\nProthoma : Exactly! We should go for nonchemical approaches to control pests. What do you think?\nElijabeth : I agree with you. I believe, such approach will control pests with minimal pesticidè use.\nProthoma : Yes. And promoting organic farming can also help reduce dependency on chemical pesticides.\nElijabeth : Education and awareness are crucial too. Farmers need to be informed about the negative aspects of overuse of pesticides.\nProthoma : Well, I think farmers should be trained in sustainable farming methods.\nElijabeth : Agreed. Also, we need to support policies that promote safe and sustainable agricultural practices.\nProthoma : Absolutely. Reducing pesticide use will benefit not just our health but also the earth."

Water pollution is the pollution of bodies of water, such as lakes, rivers, seas, the oceans, as well as groundwater. It occurs when pollutants move into it.\nKajal : How do pollutants move into water?\nRajiya : Well, it is we who are responsible for it. We haphazardly throw waste and filth into water and pollute it. Farmers using chemical fertilizers and insecticides in the field also run towards water bodies when it rains. It also causes water pollution.\nKajal : I see. Any other reasons?\nRajiya : Yes, throwing oil, food waste, and human waste into the rivers causes water pollution. Besides, insanitary latrines on the banks of the rivers and canals and drains running into the rivers and canals make water polluted.\nKajal : Oh my God! That's terrible. I wish it did not happen.\nRajiya : But we can prevent water pollution by creating mass awareness among people.\nKajal : By the way, what are the effects of water pollution?\nRajiya : Its effects are many. When we drink polluted water or use it for household purposes, we may get affected by waterborne diseases like typhoid, cholera or by any other chronic diseases. Besides, water pollution is harmful for our environment.\nKajal : We have to stop water pollution. - Otherwise, it will cause us great harm.

I think it would be better if you got yourself admitted into a college in the city as I did.\nSitu : I don't think so, Ritu. Actually, I don't like cities.\nRitu : Why? What're the things of city life you dislike?\nSitu : I think, life in the city is very artificial. People lead a very busy life there. They get up in the morning hearing the noises of motor vehicles, machines and factories.\nRitu : You're right. But there are many modern facilities that you can have only in cities. Good educational institutes, hospitals and clinics are mainly available in the city. Again, there are many spots for recreations.\nSitu: : That's true. But I think life in the village is far better than that of the town. Village life is quite natural. People lead a very simple life. They wake up from sleep hearing the chirping of the birds and can breathe in fresh air: Do you have fresh fish in the town\nRitu : - Actually, fishes are available there, but not fresh.\nSitu : But fresh food, fishes, vegetables, fruits etc. are available in the village, Moreover, village life is pollution free.\nRitu : You're right. But village life is not without its disadvantages. Disease, hunger, malnutrition and poverty are common in the life of the villagers. Also, jobs are not available here.\nSitu : Hmm. Actually, both lives have their advantages and disadvantages. I think a balanced development can remove the gap between these two types of life.\nRitu : Yes. I agree with you. See you later.\nSitu : Ok, bye. Take a good care of yourself."
