As you are aware, the common room is a vital space for students to refresh their minds and engage in recreational activities during breaks. However, the current setup is insufficient to meet the increasing needs of the students.\nThe common room lacks adequate seating arrangements, indoor game facilities, and updated newspapers and magazines. During recess, it becomes overcrowded, leaving many students without the opportunity to utilize the space effectively. This has a negative impact on our relaxation time, which is essential for maintaining focus and productivity in classes.\nWe humbly request your kind intervention to enhance the facilities in the common room by providing more chairs and tables, introducing additional indoor games like carrom and chess, and ensuring a regular supply of updated reading materials. These improvements would greatly contribute to the overall well-being and academic performance of the students.\nWe are hopeful for your understanding and prompt action in this regard.\nThank you for considering our request.\nYours faithfully,\nSumona Akter On behalf of the students Khulna Zilla School"

          "question": "",
          "explanation": "Load-shedding is a recurring issue in our daily lives, particularly in countries with inadequate power generation or poor infrastructure. It refers to the deliberate interruption of electricity supply to manage demand when it exceeds the available supply. While it may be necessary to prevent overloading the system, its impact on everyday life is profound and disruptive. Load-shedding paralyzes various aspects of our routines. Students, for instance, suffer immensely as they are forced to study in dim light or suspend their studies altogether. Businesses and industries also bear the brunt, as factories cannot operate machinery, resulting in reduced productivity and financial losses. Moreover, households face numerous inconveniences, such as disrupted cooking, lack of access to clean water due to non-functional pumps, and discomfort during extreme weather conditions when fans or air conditioners cease to work. Health services are another critical area affected; hospitals often face challenges running essential equipment, putting patients' lives at risk. Small vendors and shopkeepers lose sales as customers prefer well-lit areas to shop. Load-shedding also affects public safety since prolonged power outages can lead to an increase in theft and other crimes in poorly lit areas. The problem stems from insufficient power generation, high electricity demand, and technical faults in the grid system. While using alternative energy sources like solar panels, generators, and UPS systems provides temporary relief, a sustainable solution requires significant investment in infrastructure and renewable energy. Until then, load-shedding will remain a pressing challenge, disrupting progress and daily life."

Physical exercise is essential for sound health because it helps our body to be active. By taking regular physical exercise, we can keep ourselves fit.\n\nThere are different kinds of exercises like free hand exercises, yoga, weight lifting, gymnastics, acrobatics and so on.

So we should all take physical exercise regularly as a part and parcel of our daily life to live a healthy and happy life."
