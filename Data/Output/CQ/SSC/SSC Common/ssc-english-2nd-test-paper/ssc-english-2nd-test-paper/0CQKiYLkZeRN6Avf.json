As the world is becoming increasingly interconnected, the importance of mastering various languages has never been greater. A language club would not only enhance our communication skills but also allow us to explore diverse cultures and broaden our horizons.\nThrough a language club, students could participate in activities such as language workshops, debates, quizzes, and cultural exchange programs. Such initiatives would help improve fluency in languages like English, Bangla, and even foreign languages such as French, German, or Chinese. Moreover, it would provide an opportunity to develop confidence in public speaking, presentation, and creative writing.\nWe believe that the presence of a language club would be an asset to our school. It could inspire students to engage in academic excellence while also building a bridge to global learning opportunities. We are confident that under your guidance, the language club will thrive and positively impact the academic environment of our school.\nTherefore, we kindly request you to consider our proposal and take the necessary steps to establish a language club. We are willing to offer our cooperation to make this initiative successful.\nThank you for your attention and understanding.\nYours sincerely, Samin Class Ten [Date]"

          "explanation": "A Day Labourer\n\nA day labourer is a person who does manual labour in various sectors every day. He works hard only for his daily living. He is a common figure in our society. A day labourer is required to be healthy, strong and stout. Generally, he does not own any land or property. He renders his manual labour for his employers to earn his wages. Most of the time, he is employed in agricultural and construction work. Every day, he rises early in the morning, takes a little food and goes out for work. He has to work from dawn to dusk. He does not know what rest is. He gets his wages at the end of the day. Then he goes to market, buys his daily necessaries and returns to his home. A day labourer leads a very simple life. He lives from hand to mouth. Sorrows and sufferings are his daily companions. Sometimes, he does not have any work in bad weather. Then he and his family have to suffer much or even starve. Often, he is cheated by his employers. Besides, many people maltreat him. He is always dependent on his employer. If his employer does not pay his regular wage, he must go through a big crisis. No doubt, the service of a day labourer is very essential and valuable for us and our society. But he is ill-paid and very much neglected. So, we all should have soft corner for him so that he can lead a decent life with dignity."

          "question": "",
          "explanation": "Tree Plantation/ Importance of Trees in Our Life/Why More Trees Should Be Planted\nMen depend much on trees. Trees provide us with oxygen, food, furniture, etc. and take carbondioxide which is harmful to human beings and all animals. So to say, our life on earth largely depends upon trees. But it is a matter of great regret that we are cutting down trees very unwisely for some quick profit. It is really a matter of great concern .\nFirst, it is important to know what trees do for us. Man needs oxygen: In every breath we take oxygen in and leave carbon dioxide out. Trees leave oxygen out and take carbon dioxide in. Thus they provide us with the most necessary thing we need on earth. Trees also give us food and shelter . We cannot live without the help of trees.\nBut at present people are cutting down trees at a large scale. There are many reasons of cutting down trees. Man is cutting down them mainly for firewood and furniture. Every day our population is increasing. So, more firewood and furniture are needed for the additional people.\nTropical rain forests are also being cleared at a high rate. It takes thousands of years to grow a tropical rain forest. But, at present, they are being cleared at the rate of fourteen square miles per hour.\nOn the other hand, the effect of deforestation is very harmful and dangerous. For this, 'Greenhouse Effect' has occurred and the temperature of the world is increasing day by day. Heat waves have grasped many countries. Besides, ice is melting in the South and North Poles. The level of water in the sea is increasing on. This may lead to worldwide flood. Measures should immediately be taken to prevent deforestation. So, we should plant five trees if we cut down one. We should also try our best to stop curting down trees and save the environment. Otherwise, our future will be very difficult and uninhabitable."
