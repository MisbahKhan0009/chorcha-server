As the world is becoming increasingly interconnected, the importance of mastering various languages has never been greater. A language club would not only enhance our communication skills but also allow us to explore diverse cultures and broaden our horizons.\nThrough a language club, students could participate in activities such as language workshops, debates, quizzes, and cultural exchange programs. Such initiatives would help improve fluency in languages like English, Bangla, and even foreign languages such as French, German, or Chinese. Moreover, it would provide an opportunity to develop confidence in public speaking, presentation, and creative writing.\nWe believe that the presence of a language club would be an asset to our school. It could inspire students to engage in academic excellence while also building a bridge to global learning opportunities. We are confident that under your guidance, the language club will thrive and positively impact the academic environment of our school.\nTherefore, we kindly request you to consider our proposal and take the necessary steps to establish a language club. We are willing to offer our cooperation to make this initiative successful.\nThank you for your attention and understanding.\nYours sincerely, Samin Class Ten [Date]"

          "explanation": "A Street Hawker\n\nA street hawker sells various things roaming from place to place. He is a common figure on, our street. Generally, he sells, various items like toys, clothes, fruits, utensils, vegetables, ice-cream, and so on. He carries his goods on his head or shoulder and sometimes, in a small handcart. He walks along roads and streets from dawn to dusk. He shouts the names of the items he sells. There are other types of hawkers also. They sell nothing but buy things like empty bottles, old newspapers, magazines, books, plastic and tin containers, broken household items, etc. A street hawker is very cunning. He knows his business very well. His main customers are children and women. So, he usually comes when his customers are free from their usual work and the male persons are not at home. He generally buys his goods at a cheaper rate and sells them at a profit. In fact, their goods are cheaper than those sold in the market. But sometimes, they supply spurious and sub-standard things and cheat the customers. Yet, the service that a street hawker renders to our society is really great. He brings the goods we need daily before our house. When we cannot go out to buy our necessaries, he brings them to our doorstep. However, a street hawker leads a very simple life. He lives from hand to month. But, he is a man of dignity because he earns his bread through hard work. So, we should respect his honest labour."

For this, it is called the sowing season in our life. During this period, a student has to do certain things to be successful and happy in his future life. The principal duty of a student is to study and acquire knowledge on various things. He must study according to a routine. He has to be attentive to his studies and teachers. He should also read newspapers, magazines, literature, history, etc.\n\nA student should remember that character is the crown of a man: Therefore, he has to cultivate good manners and other noble virtues. All moral qualities like honesty, modesty, truthfulness, discipline, perseverance, sincerity, punctuality must be acquired during this time.\n\nHe should also render some services to his society and country. He should make the illiterate literate. He can make the farmers aware of the modern methods of cultivation. In population control, he can play an important role.\n\nA student must obey and honour his parents. When they are sick, helpless or old, he must serve them. He should also be obedient to his teachers and other superiors.\n\nA student must not waste his time and energy. So, he -must possess a sound health by taking regular physical exercise, taking part in games and sports. Moreover, he must always avoid evil company.\n\nBesides, a student may have the knowledge of politics but he must not take part in active politics. It is because many political parties and their unethical leaders use them only for their selfish interest.\n"
