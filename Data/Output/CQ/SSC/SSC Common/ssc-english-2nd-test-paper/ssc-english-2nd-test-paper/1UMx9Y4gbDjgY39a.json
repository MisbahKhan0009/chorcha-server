          "explanation": "Causes and Effects of Road Accident\n\nRoad accident has become a daily occurrence in our country. It has increased in number considerably in recent years. The real causes of road accidents lie with the people and not with the mechanised means of transport. Reckless driving and overtaking tendency of the drivers are responsible for most of the accidents. The drivers drive their motorised vehicles at breakneck speed. Sometimes, they lose control over steering that leads to accidents. Violation of traffic rules by both the pedestrians and the drivers also causes road accidents. The situation becomes worse when the slow-moving rickshaws and carts tussle with cars, buses and trucks. In some cities, roads are too narrow and inadequate. These can hardly cope with the ever-increasing volume of traffic. Mechanical failures, including faulty brakes and bald tyres also result in fatal açcidents. Every year, thousands of people die and many more get injured in road accidents. Sometimes, the injured have to embrace disability forever. Road accidents also cause material losses including waste of money for the treatment of the injured and repairing the vehicles. The consequences of road accident leave a lasting impact on the individuals and their family. In the long run, a road accident affects the economy of the country: Road accidents have become a great menace in our society. Stern steps must be taken to check this danger. Spacious roads should be constructed and traffic signals should be set up at the key points. Heavy penalty should be imposed on those who violate the traffic rules. Moreover, common people should be made aware of the traffic rules through radio, television, newspapers and posters. If the city administrations work sincerely, the number of road accidents is sure to come down."

          "explanation": "Importance/ Benefits of Reading Newspapers\n\nNewspaper plays a unique role in our daily life. It is called the mirror of the world. Sitting in our room, we can know the situation of the world. The social, economic, cultural and political situations of a country are expressed in newspapers. By reading newspapers the people of a country can also know the details of different countries of the world. So, newspaper is called the storehouse of knowledge.\nMany of us are very fond of reading newspapers. We cannot think of a single morning without having a newspaper and a cup of hot tea. It is too much favourite an item for us. There are various types of news in it. It carries news from all sides and of all topics of the world. Choosing columns depends on one's own mentality. So, while reading newspapers, someone opens the first pageand another the last one. There are the yritings of the remarkable writers in it. It bears daily information, tragic scenes, news of development activities, remarkable incidents, weather forecast and so on. It is said that newspapers are the scale to understand the standard of a nation.\n\nSometimes many odd or false pieces of information are also published in newspapers. This is called yellow journalism that results in great problems in a country. So, the authorities or writers must be conscious of the interests of a country, otherwise it may hamper national and international relations. In developing international relations, newspapers act as a medium. They also offer various adyertisements of jobs. So, they are helpful for removing unemployment. The stories and novels give us much pleasure. So, considering all these, we find that reading newspapers is great indeed."
