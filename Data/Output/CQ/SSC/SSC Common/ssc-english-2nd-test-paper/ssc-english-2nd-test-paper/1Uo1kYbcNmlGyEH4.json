I travelled alone because none of my close friends or family members were free that day. At first, I felt a little scared, but I also felt excited to enjoy a new experience by myself. The journey started early in the morning. I took a bus from Gazipur and watched the green fields, rivers, and small villages pass by outside the window. After a few hours, I reached the place, which was surrounded by hills, trees, and fresh air. The calm nature made me feel relaxed. I walked beside a small lake and took many pictures. The sound of birds and the cool breeze made the place feel magical. Since I was alone, I had a lot of time to think about my life and dreams. I bought some local food, like pitha and fresh fruits, from a roadside stall and enjoyed them while sitting under a big tree. I also talked to a friendly shopkeeper who told me stories about the area. In the afternoon, I sat quietly and watched the sunset. The sky turned orange and pink, and it was one of the most beautiful scenes I had ever seen. As the day ended, I felt proud that I travelled alone and enjoyed nature in my own way. The tour taught me that sometimes being alone can help us understand ourselves better. It was truly a peaceful and refreshing day out of the home."

After 11 a.m., it becomes very difficult for students to continue classes. Many students feel weak and tired because of the heat. Sometimes it is even unsafe to sit in the classroom for a long time. Considering this situation, I humbly request you to kindly change the school timing during the summer season. If the school can start earlier in the morning, students will be able to attend classes comfortably and study well without feeling tired. Morning classes will also help us stay healthy and active.\nI, therefore, hope that you would be kind enough to consider the fact and take necessary steps to make morning school for the next three months and oblige.\n\nYours obediently,\nFarzad Jawad Zarif\nClass: X, Section: B\nRoll: 03"

          "explanation": "A Farmer\n\nA farmer is a very familiar and important figure in our country. He works hard to grow food for the whole nation. Without farmers, we cannot have rice, vegetables, fruits, or other food items. Bangladesh is an agricultural country. Most people live in villages and depend on farming for their living. That is why, Farmers keep the wheels of economy of our country running.\nA farmer usually lives in a village. His life is simple, but his work is very important. He usually gets up very early in the morning, sometimes before sunrise. He goes to his field and starts his work. He works very hard in all kinds of weather. Sometimes he works under the hot sun, and sometimes in heavy rain. First, he prepares the soil and plants seeds. Then he waters the crops and protects them from insects and pests. During the rainy season, he works in the wet fields and sometimes struggles with floods. In the dry season, he irrigates the crops using water from rivers or tube wells. Farmers. grow many types of crops in Bangladesh, such as rice, jute, vegetables, wheat, and fruits like mango, jack-fruit, and guava.\nFarmers work very hard under the sun, rain, and sometimes in storms. They do not get enough rest, but they never stop working because they know the whole country depends on their hard work. During harvest time, they collect the crops and sell them in markets.\nWe should respect farmers and help them. They deserve our appreciation because they provide.food for everyone. If there are no farmers, we cannot live. A farmer's life is full of hard work, patience, and honesty. He may lead a simple life, but he is truly a hero of the nation. So, we should be thankful to all farmers who work day and night to feed the nation."
