As you are aware, the common room is a vital space for students to refresh their minds and engage in recreational activities during breaks. However, the current setup is insufficient to meet the increasing needs of the students.\nThe common room lacks adequate seating arrangements, indoor game facilities, and updated newspapers and magazines. During recess, it becomes overcrowded, leaving many students without the opportunity to utilize the space effectively. This has a negative impact on our relaxation time, which is essential for maintaining focus and productivity in classes.\nWe humbly request your kind intervention to enhance the facilities in the common room by providing more chairs and tables, introducing additional indoor games like carrom and chess, and ensuring a regular supply of updated reading materials. These improvements would greatly contribute to the overall well-being and academic performance of the students.\nWe are hopeful for your understanding and prompt action in this regard.\nThank you for considering our request.\nYours faithfully,\nSumona Akter On behalf of the students Khulna Zilla School"

          "explanation": "A Street Hawker\n\nA street hawker sells various things roaming from place to place. He is a common figure on, our street. Generally, he sells, various items like toys, clothes, fruits, utensils, vegetables, ice-cream, and so on. He carries his goods on his head or shoulder and sometimes, in a small handcart. He walks along roads and streets from dawn to dusk. He shouts the names of the items he sells. There are other types of hawkers also. They sell nothing but buy things like empty bottles, old newspapers, magazines, books, plastic and tin containers, broken household items, etc. A street hawker is very cunning. He knows his business very well. His main customers are children and women. So, he usually comes when his customers are free from their usual work and the male persons are not at home. He generally buys his goods at a cheaper rate and sells them at a profit. In fact, their goods are cheaper than those sold in the market. But sometimes, they supply spurious and sub-standard things and cheat the customers. Yet, the service that a street hawker renders to our society is really great. He brings the goods we need daily before our house. When we cannot go out to buy our necessaries, he brings them to our doorstep. However, a street hawker leads a very simple life. He lives from hand to month. But, he is a man of dignity because he earns his bread through hard work. So, we should respect his honest labour."

          "explanation": "Duties of a Student\n\nThe period of life, which we spend to receive education in educational institutions is called student life. It is the most important and valuable period in one's life. This is the time, when the seeds of future life are sown. For this, it is called the sowing season of our life. During this period, a student has to do certain things to be successful in life.\nThe first and foremost duty of a student is to study hard. However, he must not confine himself to the prescribed books only. He must read newspaper, magazines, novels, dramas, etc. during his leisure. This will widen his mental horizon and enable him to be acquainted with the affairs of the world. Moreover, he should follow some rules and regulations. He should not waste his valuable time. He should be regular and punctual in his classes. He should take part in all types of extra-curricular activities such as singing, dancing, reciting, debating, painting, scouting, etc.\nA student should bear in mind that character is the crown of a man. So, he has to cultivate good manners and other noble virtues. He must not keep bad company. He should abstain from any type of bad, habits. All moral qualities like honesty, modesty, truthfulness, discipline, perseverance, sincerity, punctuality must be acquired during this period. He must be respectful to his parents, teachers and other superiors. He has to render helping hands to the helpless. He should be polite to all and rude to none. 'Simple living and high thinking' must be the motto of his life.\nMoreover, students should also render some duties and responsibilities to the society. They can teach the illiterate people about family planning, health, nutrition, child rearing, scientific method of cultivation etc. During natural calamities, students should come forward to help the affected people. They should collect food, clothes, medicine etc. and distribute them among the affected people.\nIn addition to these, a student has to be careful of his health as a sound mind lies in a sound body. Good health is the key to success. So, he should take physical exercise regularly and take part in various games and sports. Besides, he should always keep himself neat and clean.\nStudent life paves the way for one's future. So, every student should utilise this period of life in order to do something great in future.\n"
