A school library is only for the teachers and the students of a school. We have an up-to-date library in our school. It is housed in a separate one-storey building. It is quite spacious and well-ventilated. The books are arranged systemically in different bookshelves. So, we have no difficulty in finding out the expected books. Our school library has a good collection of text and reference books. It has also books on different branches of knowledge like literature, history, science, commerce, geography, travels, biography and so on. Besides, it has a good supply of newspapers, magazines and journals. Moreover, there is a librarian in charge of our school library. He is well-trained, qualified and experienced. Every student has a library card. We can borrow two books at a time. Nobody is allowed to keep a book for more than two weeks. In the library, discipline and silence is strictly maintained. While studying in the reading room, students are strictly prohibited to talk or disturb others in any way. The calm and quiet atmosphere of the library helps the students to work attentively. Our school library plays an important role in enriching both our academic and general knowledge. It provides us with the opportunity to read different types of books. To us, it is a storehouse of knowledge. I think, every educational institution should have a library. To conclude it can be said that no educational institute is a complete one without a library."
