If there is no cloud and the sky is clear, the night becomes bright. A moonlit night can be best enjoyed from any village where there is no light of electricity or any other source. The main attractions of a moonlit night are the merriment of children, gossiping of young people, singing of women and telling stories of the old. Another attraction is travelling by boat. During the moonlit night the moon looks like a dise of gold. The moon plays hide and seek behind the clouds. Twinkling stars surround the moon to make the sky a fairy land. The birds come out of their nests. The animals leave their fold and move around. The water of seas, rivers, canals, ponds and lakes reflect the moon light to create a beautiful effect. It is a night of beauty and joy. So, I like a moonlit night and enjoy it very much."

Physical exercise is essential for sound health because it helps our body to be active. By taking regular physical exercise, we can keep ourselves fit.\nThere are different kinds of exercises like free hand exercises, yoga, weight lifting, gymnastics, acrobatics and so on. Free hand exercises help one to get sound health. Weight lifting is for professional players. Walking is good for all. For the children, running, swimming and playing ordinary games are suitable.\nThe importance of physical exercise in our practical life is great. It helps us to build a sound body. It helps us to keep away from diseases. It is immensely helpful for sound mind in a sound body. However, anything excessive is bad. One should take exercises following the rules with proper diet and rest, otherwise he will suffer.\nIn. our country, some people do not take physical exercise. They think. that it is unnecessary and mere killing of time. But, in fact, they are wrong. By taking physical exercise, we can remain healthy and do our respective jobs properly. Without physical exercise, our health breaks down and we suffer from various diseases and complications. We should take exercise according to our age and condition of our body. Then we can be benefited easily from every kind of exercise.\nPhysical exercise is necessary to build a nation. Healthy children are the. healthy citizens of the future. So, we should all take physical exercise regularly as a part and parcel of our daily life to live a healthy and happy life."
