As you are aware, the common room is a vital space for students to refresh their minds and engage in recreational activities during breaks. However, the current setup is insufficient to meet the increasing needs of the students.\nThe common room lacks adequate seating arrangements, indoor game facilities, and updated newspapers and magazines. During recess, it becomes overcrowded, leaving many students without the opportunity to utilize the space effectively. This has a negative impact on our relaxation time, which is essential for maintaining focus and productivity in classes.\nWe humbly request your kind intervention to enhance the facilities in the common room by providing more chairs and tables, introducing additional indoor games like carrom and chess, and ensuring a regular supply of updated reading materials. These improvements would greatly contribute to the overall well-being and academic performance of the students.\nWe are hopeful for your understanding and prompt action in this regard.\nThank you for considering our request.\nYours faithfully,\nSumona Akter On behalf of the students Khulna Zilla School"

          "explanation": "A farmer is the person, who cultivates lands and grows different types of crops to earn his bread. Generally, a farmer is a poor man and lives in the village. In Bangladesh, the life of a farmer is pitiable. Most of the farmers have no land of their own. So, most of the time he is to cultivate the land of others. Usually; a farmer is an illiterate person. He does not know how to plough his land scientifically. He cannot apply scientific method. He has only a pair of bullocks and some hand-made tools. Often he does not have enough money to buy seeds, fertilizer or pesticide. As a result, he cannot produce more food for himself and his family. He lives from hand to mouth. He also has pleasures and pains in life. If he gets a good harvest, his face beams with joy. On the other hand, if the harvest is not good, his sorrows know no bounds. He works very hard to prepare the land for planting or sowing crops. As the farmers grow and reap the harvest, we have our food. By working hard in the field, he grows a bumper crop which helps develop our national economy. We know that ours is an agricultural country. More than 80 percent people are directly or indirectly engaged in agriculture. Our economy is also mostly dependent on agriculture. So, to promote the development of national economy, the farmers should be helped with agricultural subsidies by the government. They should be encouraged to use tractors instead of the age-old ploughs. They should also be taught to use the modern cultivation methods. This is how, the life of a farmer can be developed."

          "explanation": "Newspaper plays a unique role in our daily life. It is called the mirror of the world. Sitting in our room, we can know the situation of the world. The social, economic, cultural and political situations of a country are expressed in newspapers. By reading newspapers the people of a country can also know the details of different countries of the world. So, newspaper is called the storehouse of knowledge. Many of us are very fond of reading newspapers. We cannot think of a single morning without having a newspaper and a cup of hot tea. It is too much favorite an item for us. There are various types of news in it. It carries news from all sides and of all topics of the world. Choosing columns depends on one's awn mentality. So, while reading newspapers, someone opens the first page and another the last one. There are the writings of the remarkable-writers in it. It bears daily information, tragic -scenes, news of development activities, remarkable incidents, weather forecast and so on. It is said that newspapers are the scale to understand the standard of a nation.\nSometimes many odd or false pieces of information are also published in newspapers. This is called yellow journalism that results in great problems in a country. So, the authorities or writers must be conscious of the interests of a country, otherwise it may hamper national and international relations. In developing international relations, newspapers act as a medium. They also offer various advertisements of jobs. So, they are helpful for removing unemployment. The stories and novels give us much pleasure. So, considering all these, we find that reading newspapers is great indeed."
