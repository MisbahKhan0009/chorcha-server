          "explanation": "The Life of a Farmer\n\nA farmer is the person, who cultivates lands and grows different types of crops to earn his bread. Generally, a farmer is a poor man and lives in the village. In Bangladesh, the life of a farmer is pitiable. Most of the farmers have no land of their own. So, most of the time he is to cultivate the land of others. Usually, a farmer is an illiterate person. He does not know how to plough his land scientifically. He cannot apply scientific method. He has only a pair of bullocks and some handmade tools. Often he does not have enough money to buy seeds, fertilizer or pesticide. As a result, he cannot produce more food for himself and his family. He lives from hand to mouth. He also has pleasures and pains in life. If he gets a good harvest, his face beams with joy. On the other hand, if the harvest is not good, his sorrows know no bounds. He works very hard to prepare the land for planting or sowing crops. As the farmers grow and reap the harvest, we have our food. By working hard in the field, he grows a bumper crop which helps develop our national economy. We know that ours is an agricultural country. More than 80 percent people are directly or indirectly engaged in agriculture. Our economy is also mostly dependent on agriculture. So, to promote the development of national economy, the farmers should be helped with agricultural subsidies by the government. They should be encouraged to use tractors instead of the age-old ploughs. They should also be taught to use the modem cultivation methods. This is how, the life of a farmer can be developed."

A journey by train is especially pleasant, because it is safe and comfortable. Whenever I get a chance to travel by train, I never miss it. Last month, I enjoyed a journey by train with my family members from Dhaka to Chattogram. It was one of the most enjoyable journeys in my life.\n\nOn the scheduled day, we reached Kamalapur Railway Station early in the morning. The station was very crowded and noisy. We bought our tickets and got into the train. I managed my seat beside a window. Suddenly, the train blew its whistle and I jumped. Then the train began to move.\n\nAt first, the train was moving slowly. After a while, it began to move in full speed. Trees, houses, people, etc. all seemed going backwards. Gentle breeze began to enter our compartment. The rhythmic sound and jerking of the train made me very excited. I wanted to put my head out of the window, but my parents did not let me do that. I looked through the window and saw many beautiful sights. The paddy fields and other trees were very beautiful to look at. They were tossing their heads in the breeze. While the train was crossing a bridge, I saw some country-boats in the rivers. Sometimes, our train moved through open fields. I saw the farmers working and the children playing cricket or football there. All these gave me new and exciting experiences.\n\nOur compartment was crowded. There was no vacant seat. Some of the passengers were talking on various topics. Some were reading newspapers or magazines. Some were sleeping, too. Sometimes, hawkers came with various items. Our train made stops at a few big and small'stations. When our train entered Chattogram, I saw many hills.\n\nAt last, the train reached Chattogram station at noon. And our journey ended. The journey gave me immense pleasure and experience. I wish I could make it again and again."
