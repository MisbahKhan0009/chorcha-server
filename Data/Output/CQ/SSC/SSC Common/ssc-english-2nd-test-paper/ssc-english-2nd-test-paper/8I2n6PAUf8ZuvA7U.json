But there is no canteen in our school campus. Many of us come to school from distant places. Often our classes continue from 10 am to 4 pm. To pass this long time, we need a good tiffin. Most often we have to take tiffin from roadside restaurants. These restaurants are not only expensive but also unhygienic.\nWe, therefore, hope that you would be kind enough to take steps to set up a canteen in the school campus for the betterment of the students.\n\nObediently yours,\nFahim\nRoll No. 1 Class-9\nOn behalf of the students of\nADP Sammiloni High School"

          "explanation": "A Rainy Day\n\nA rainy day is dull and gloomy. Sometimes, it drizzles and sometimes, it rains heavily all day long. The sky remains overcast with black clouds. The sun is hardly visible. Gusty wind blows from all sides. Birds keep standing on branches of trees or keep quiet in their nests. Cattle remain in their sheds and bellow for the fodder. Water stands here and there. Unpitched roads become muddy and slippery. Passers-by have to walk with umbrella over their head, shoes in hand and pants folded up to the knee. Sometimes people slip and fall on the muddy road. In cities, a rainy day is now a horror. The roads and streets in some towns and cities get flooded. Vehicles are seen stranding in knee-deep water in some areas due to water clogging. It causes gridlock across the city. It is a day of trouble and annoyance to the office-going people. They have to suffer from various inconveniences. But for the school going children, it is a delight to have a rainy day. If it rains heavily before their school time, they get a holiday: Sometimes, children, especially the boys play football in the rainwater in the nearby fields. A rainy day is a curse for the poor. The day labourers cannot go out for work and hence, they have to suffer a lot. However, I pass the day by listening to music, watching TV or reading journals. In short, a rainy day is a day of both pleasure and pain."

          "explanation": "Importance/ Benefits of Reading Newspapers\n\nNewspaper plays a unique role in our daily life. It is called the mirror of the world. Sitting in our room, we can know the situation of the world. The social, economic, cultural and political situations of a country are expressed in newspapers. By reading newspapers the people of a country can also know the details of different countries of the world. So, newspaper is called the storehouse of knowledge.\n\nMany of us are very fond of reading newspapers. We cannot think of a single morning without having a newspaper and a cup of hot tea. It is too much favourite an item for us. There are various types of news in it. It carries news from all sides and of all topics of the world. Choosing columns depends on one's own mentality. So, while reading newspapers, someone opens the first pageand another the last one. There are the yritings of the remarkable writers in it. It bears daily information, tragic scenes, news of development activities, remarkable incidents, weather forecast and so on. It is said that newspapers are the scale to understand the standard of a nation.\nSometimes many odd or false pieces of information are also published in newspapers. This is called yellow journalism that results in great problems in a country. So, the authorities or writers must be conscious of the interests of a country, otherwise it may hamper national and international relations. In developing international relations, newspapers act as a medium. They also offer various advertisements of jobs. So, they are helpful for removing unemployment. The stories and novels give us much pleasure. So, considering all these, we find that reading newspapers is great indeed."
