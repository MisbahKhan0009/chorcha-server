Nowadays, it has become very popular in our country. Last month, I visited a book fair. I went there with my elder brother. The fair was arranged on the occasion of 21t February, the International Mother Language Day. It was held at the Bangla Academy premises. As it was imy first visit to a book fair, I was really surprised when I entered the fair. There were hundreds of stalls at the fair. The environment was charming. The stalls were arranged systematically. There were information counters. There were also some stalls for taking snacks. I saw that all kinds of books such as fiction, drama, poetry, novel, biography, translation, children's literature, story books, etc. were available at the fair. I bought some books on science fiction and comics. After walking for a long time, we became tired. So, we entered a food stall and took some light food. Suddenly, I noticed a crowd in front of a stall. I went there and became surprised to see my favourite writer Abdul Hye Sikder. He was giving autographs. I also took an autograph. We also atterided a short seminar at the fair in which some renowned personalities of our country delivered speeches on the importance of books in our. life. After that, we left the fair, but I brought with me a lot of pleasant experiences."

          "explanation": "There are six seasons in Bangladesh, the land of natural beauty. They are summer, rainy, autumn, late autumn, winter and spring. Every season has its unique features. Of all these seasons I like the spring most.. This season consists of the Bangla months of Falgun and Chaitra. It is the best, the loveliest and the most charming of all the seasons. There are some specific reaons why I like the spring most.\nTo me, the winter is very cold, dull and lifeless. In summer, the scorching sun, hot days and nights make life miserable. The heavy rain and frequent floods in the rainy season bring great sufferings to the people. The autumn and the late autumn have also more or less the disadvantages like the summer, rainy and winter seasons. But the spring has none of the inconveniences of these seasons. Coming after winter, it captivates the hearts of all.\nWith the arrival of the spring, nature puts on a lively look. Everything in the nature looks fresh. The sky looks' clear and blue, trees put forth new leaves, and the flowers of charming colour and scent bloom in trees. Bees and butterflies hum and fly from one flower to another. During this season, gentle breeze begins to blow. Sweet twitters of birds are heard. The melodious notes of the cuckoo please our ears. All these charming and pleasing sights and sounds have a positive influence on our mind. Everywhere there is joy and mirth. People also enjoy a better health. Besides, during this time, various kinds of vegetables and fruits are also available. The season has a few disadvantages, too. During this season, some people suffer from diseases like diarrhoea, cholera, chicken-pox, etc.\nIn spite of its few disadvantages, its positive aspects are overwhelming. The convenience it offers fascinates all. That's why, I like the spring season most."
