As you are aware, the common room is a vital space for students to refresh their minds and engage in recreational activities during breaks. However, the current setup is insufficient to meet the increasing needs of the students.\nThe common room lacks adequate seating arrangements, indoor game facilities, and updated newspapers and magazines. During recess, it becomes overcrowded, leaving many students without the opportunity to utilize the space effectively. This has a negative impact on our relaxation time, which is essential for maintaining focus and productivity in classes.\nWe humbly request your kind intervention to enhance the facilities in the common room by providing more chairs and tables, introducing additional indoor games like carrom and chess, and ensuring a regular supply of updated reading materials. These improvements would greatly contribute to the overall well-being and academic performance of the students.\nWe are hopeful for your understanding and prompt action in this regard.\nThank you for considering our request.\nYours faithfully,\nSumona Akter On behalf of the students Khulna Zilla School"

One day, I visited a tea stall in my locality and spent about an hour observing its bustling atmosphere. The aroma of freshly brewed tea mixed with the chatter of customers created a warm, inviting vibe. A group of elderly men was engaged in animated discussions about politics, while a few young students, books in hand, debated cricket scores. The vendor, a cheerful man with a quick smile, expertly poured steaming tea into small earthen cups, his movements swift and practiced. The stall was modest, with wooden benches and a tin roof, yet it felt like a community center where everyone found solace in a cup of tea. The simplicity and energy of the place left a lasting impression, reminding me of the beauty in everyday moments."

The social, economic, cultural and political situations of a country are expressed in newspapers. By reading newspapers the people of a country can also know the details of different countries of the world. So, newspaper is called the storehouse of knowledge.\nMany of us are very fond of reading newspapers. We cannot think of a single morning without having a newspaper and a cup of hot tea. It is too much favourite an item for us. There are various types of news in it. It carries news from all sides and of all topics of the world. Choosing columns depends on one's own mentality. So, while reading newspapers, someone opens the first page and another the last one. There are the Writings of the remarkable writers in it. It bears daily information, tragic scenes, news of development activities, remarkable incidents, weather forecast and so on. It is said that newspapers are the scale to understand the standard of a nation.\nSometimes many odd or false pieces of information are also published in newspapers. This is called yellow journalism that results in great problems in a country. So, the authorities or writers must be conscious of the interests of a country, otherwise it may hamper national and international relations. In developing international relations, newspapers act as a medium. They also offer various adyertisements of jobs. So, they are helpful for removing unemployment. The stories and novels give us much pleasure. So, considering all these, we find that reading newspapers is great indeed."
