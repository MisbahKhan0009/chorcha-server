But there is no canteen in our school campus. Many of us come to school from distant places. Often our classes continue from 10 am to 4 pm. To pass this long time, we need a good tiffin. Most often we have to take tiffin from roadside restaurants. These restaurants are not only expensive but also unhygienic.\nWe, therefore, hope that you would be kind enough to take steps to set up a canteen in the school campus for the betterment of the students.\n\nObediently yours,\nNasim\nRoll No. Class-9\nOn bèhalf of the students of\nABC Model High School,\nSylhet"

          "explanation": "My Childhood Memories\nMan loves to turn back to his past and feel nostalgic. Childhood is an important part of human life as many events of both pleasure and pain take place during that period. To me childhood is the sweetest period in a man's life. The 'memories of my childhood haunt (তাড়িত করে) me like a passion (ঘোর, মোহ) very often. Whenever I feel very lonely or dejected, I dive into the memories of my childhood, remove my loneliness and fill my heart with happiness. Then, I wish I could be a child again! The memories of my school days dominate my childhood. I was sent to school at six. I studied in a distant primary school named Kanchichora Government Primary school upto class two. Then I was made to take my admission in another school called Mathbari Government Primary School. I used to go to school with my village friends. My cousin who was one year senior to me was my constant school-going companion. In school the classes were not much interesting to me but the leisure period while we used to play various sports. I was a regular student in my class. So I was hardly beaten or scolded (বকাবকি করা) by my teachers for negligence to studies. After the school was over, in our way home, we used to-play ha-du-du, hide and seek, gather plums or steal' green mangoes-from some trees and sometimes used to bath in stream. One day I along with my three friends went to a friend's house to eat green-plum. But as thè tree was long, none of us dared to climb it up. Hence, we had to come back in a dissatisfied mind.\nIn my school I was not a good athlete. Yet I used to take part in various events. Once I got two prizes in race and long-jump and therefore became very excited and happy. The holidays were favourite to me. On holidays I used to play with my friends almost the whole day. Sometimes I would go to some other village for play. I also would visit my nearby relatives on holidays. How happy I was in my childhood days! The happy and pleasant memories of those days still give me pleasure. If I could go back to those days again!"
