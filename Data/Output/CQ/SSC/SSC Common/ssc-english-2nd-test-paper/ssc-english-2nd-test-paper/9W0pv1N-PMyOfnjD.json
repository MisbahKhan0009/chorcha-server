Our school library is not well-equipped. Quality books are not available here. Moreover, if a\nstudent wants to read reference books, s/he finds it difficult to find one there.

          "explanation": "\n\nAfforestation\n\nAfforestation means planting trees in places where there were no trees before. It helps make the environment healthy and beautiful. Throughout the world, afforestation is very important because our forests are getting smaller. People cut down trees to make space for homes, farms, and factories, but we need trees to survive. Trees give us oxygen, which we need to breathe, and they also give homes to animals and birds. Planting more trees helps reduce air pollution and keeps the soil strong, which stops floods and landslides. The Sundarbans, a large forest in our country, is home to many animals like the Royal Bengal Tiger. But this forest also needs protection, so planting trees around it and in other areas is very important. The government and many groups encourage people, especially students, to plant trees. By doing this, we can make sure Bangladesh stays green, safe, and full of life for future generations.\n"

          "explanation": "\n\nStudents and Social Services\nOr, Service Rendered by the Students to Build up Our Nation\n\nStudents are the future leaders and makers of a nation. They are the devotees in the temple of learning. So, the most important duty of students is to study seriously with devotion. It does not mean that they are isolated from the society. They are also social beings like other classes of people. They enjoy the same social benefits, rights and privileges. So, as members of society, they have certain duties to the society in which they live in: There are many kinds of social services and students have a lot to do in these sectors.\n\nLiving in a developing country like ours, students must render some social services for the development and welfare of the nation. So during the long, vacation and leisure time, students can open night schools and teach the illiterate working children and adult people. They can also teach the farmers about the modern methods of cultivation, the use of fertilizers and proper caring of crops. They can also suggest them to dig a pond for fish cultivation or to make a farm. .\n\nStudents can render immense service in the field of health. The village people and the people living in the slums have. no knowledge about health, nutrition and sanitation. The students can teach them about the basic rules of health, nutrition and sanitation. Female students can also teach the uneducated women how to keep their houses neat and clean, how to bring up children and look after their health.\n"
