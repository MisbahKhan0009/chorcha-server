Shukrabad has always been known for its peaceful neighbourhood. But recently some miscreants have started sitting in the tea stalls in front of the society gate.

They have become a nuisance for the whole society. They must be stopped and brought to justice soon.\nTherefore, I humbly request you to take necessary steps to stop these miscreants so that the people of the locality can get freedom from living in hell.\nYours faithfully,\nMohammad Aziz\n(On behalf of the people of Ward 27, Sukrabad)"

He is quite familiar both in cities and towns. Generally, he lives in a slum. Though he works hard from morning till late night, he leads a poor life. He does not consider the condition of the weather. He works hard despite foul weather. Sometimes there arises a dispute between him and the passenger for fare. If he falls sick, his family members fall in distress. All of them have to starve. He cannot enjoy peace and happiness. He also suffers from inferiority complex. Besides, his children cannot hope for a bright future. Sometimes some passengers behave roughly with him. But he does not have sufficient strength to tackle it. Some rickshaw-pullers try to cheat the passengers. He takes rest here and there or sitting on his rickshaw. On the whole, his life is full of sufferings. To support his, family, he has to drive the rickshaw despite his sickness. In fact, he leads a poor and subhuman life."
