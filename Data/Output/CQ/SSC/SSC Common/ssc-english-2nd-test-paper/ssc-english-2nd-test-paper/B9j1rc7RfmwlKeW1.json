As the world is becoming increasingly interconnected, the importance of mastering various languages has never been greater. A language club would not only enhance our communication skills but also allow us to explore diverse cultures and broaden our horizons.\nThrough a language club, students could participate in activities such as language workshops, debates, quizzes, and cultural exchange programs. Such initiatives would help improve fluency in languages like English, Bangla, and even foreign languages such as French, German, or Chinese. Moreover, it would provide an opportunity to develop confidence in public speaking, presentation, and creative writing.\nWe believe that the presence of a language club would be an asset to our school. It could inspire students to engage in academic excellence while also building a bridge to global learning opportunities. We are confident that under your guidance, the language club will thrive and positively impact the academic environment of our school.\nTherefore, we kindly request you to consider our proposal and take the necessary steps to establish a language club. We are willing to offer our cooperation to make this initiative successful.\nThank you for your attention and understanding.\nYours sincerely, Samin Class Ten [Date]"

He is quite familiar both in cities and towns. Generally, he lives in a slum. Though he works hard from morning till late night, he leads a poor life. He does not consider the condition of the weather. He works hard despite foul weather. Sometimes there arises a dispute between him and the passenger for fare. If he falls sick, his family members fall in distress. All of them have to starve. He cannot enjoy peace and happiness. He also suffers from inferiority complex. Besides, his children cannot hope for a bright future. Sometimes some passengers behave roughly with him. But he does not have sufficient strength to tackle it. Some rickshaw-pullers try to cheat the passengers. He takes rest here and there or sitting on his rickshaw. On the whole, his life is full of sufferings. To support his, family, he has to drive the rickshaw despite his sickness. In fact, he leads a poor and subhuman life."

          "explanation": "The Season I Like Most/ The Spring in Bangladesh\n\nThe change in nature is always visible with the beginning of a new season. There are six seasons in Bangladesh. The spring is one of them. It is the best and the most charming of all the seasons. The Bangla months of Falgun and Chaitra make this season. I like this season most as it is rich in colour, beauty, music and fragrance.\n\nAmong the seasons, the spring occupies a very high position. To me the winter is very cold, dull and lifeless. In summer, the scorching sun, hot days and nights make life miserable. The heavy rain and frequent floods in the rainy season bring great sufferings for us. The autumn and the late autumn have more or less the disadvantages of the rainy season and the winter respectively. But the spring has none of the inconveniences of these seasons. Coming after winter, it captivates the hearts of all.\n\nActually with the advent of the spring, nature puts on a lively look. Everything looks fresh. The sky looks clear and blue, trees put forth new leaves, flowers of charming colour and fragrance bloom in trees. Bees and butterflies hum and fly from flowers to flowers. During this season, gentle breeze from the south begins to blow. It spreads the sweet smell of the flowers and makes the air balmy and fragrant. When the breeze passes through the dry leaves, it produces a pleasant rustling sound in the air. Sweet twitters of the birds are heard. The melodious notes of the cuckoo please our ears. All these charming and pleasing sights and sounds have a positive effect on our mind. Everywhere there is joy and mirth. People enjoy a better health. They are happier in this season.\nBesides, various kinds of vegetables and fruits are also available during this season.\n\nHowever, every season has its own special characteristics. But none is as colourful as the spring. Truly speaking, this season is very elusive in the sense that it disappears before we can savour its charms fully. Perhaps its short stay has made it dearer to us."
