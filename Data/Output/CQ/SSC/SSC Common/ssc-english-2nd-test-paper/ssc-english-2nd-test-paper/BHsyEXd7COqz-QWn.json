As you are aware, the common room is a vital space for students to refresh their minds and engage in recreational activities during breaks. However, the current setup is insufficient to meet the increasing needs of the students.\nThe common room lacks adequate seating arrangements, indoor game facilities, and updated newspapers and magazines. During recess, it becomes overcrowded, leaving many students without the opportunity to utilize the space effectively. This has a negative impact on our relaxation time, which is essential for maintaining focus and productivity in classes.\nWe humbly request your kind intervention to enhance the facilities in the common room by providing more chairs and tables, introducing additional indoor games like carrom and chess, and ensuring a regular supply of updated reading materials. These improvements would greatly contribute to the overall well-being and academic performance of the students.\nWe are hopeful for your understanding and prompt action in this regard.\nThank you for considering our request.\nYours faithfully,\nSumona Akter On behalf of the students Khulna Zilla School"

          "explanation": "A national flag is the symbol of independence and sovereignty of a country. Every free nation of the world has its own national flag. It introduces a country to the whole world. As a free nation, we also have a national flag of our own. We achieved this flag through a bloody war against the Pakistani military forces in 1971. The shape of our national flag is rectangular. The ratio of its length and width is 10:6. It is made of cotton, linen or silk. It bears a combination of two colours. The major part of it is deep green and there is a red circle in the middle of it. The radius of the circle is one-fifth of the length of the flag. Its deep green colour stands for everlasting youth, freshness and vigour of our nation. It also symbolises the greenery of Bangladesh. On the other hand, the red circle symbolises the rising sun of independence. It also stands for the supreme sacrifices of our heroic freedom fighters, who laid down their lives for the independence of our motherland. The flag is hoisted every day on the top of the buildings of government semi-government offices and educational institutions. Moreover, it is hoisted everywhere on the Independent Day and the Victory Day. Besides, it is kept half-mast, on our national mourning days. Our national flag is the source of our spirit, hope, and aspiration: So, we must defend our independence at any cost and save the existence and prestige of our national flag."

The social, economic, cultural and political situations of a country are expressed in newspapers. By reading newspapers the people of a country can also know the details of different countries of the world. So, newspaper is called the storehouse of knowledge.\nMany of us are very fond of reading newspapers. We cannot think of a single morning without having a newspaper and a cup of hot tea. It is too much favourite an item for us. There are various types of news in it. It carries news from all sides and of all topics of the world. Choosing columns depends on one's own mentality. So, while reading newspapers, someone opens the first page. and another the last one. There are the writings of the remarkable-writers in it. It bears daily information, tragic scenes, news of development activities, remarkable incidents, weather forecast and so on. It is said that newspapers are the scale to understand the standard of a nation.\nSometimes many odd or false pieces of information are also published in newspapers. This is called yellow journalism that results in great problems in a country. So, the authorities or writers must be conscious of the interests of a country, otherwise it may hamper national and international relations. In developing international relations, newspapers act as a medium. They also offer various advertisements of jobs. So, they are helpful for removing unemployment. The stories and novels give us much, pleasure. So, considering all these, we find that reading newspapers is great indeed."
