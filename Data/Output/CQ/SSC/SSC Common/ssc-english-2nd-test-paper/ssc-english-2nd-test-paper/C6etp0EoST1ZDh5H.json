          "explanation": "The Life of a Farmer\n\nA farmer is the person, who cultivates lands and grows different types of crops to earn his bread. Generally, a farmer is a poor man and lives in the village. In Bangladesh, the life of a farmer is pitiable. Most of the farmers have no land of their own. So, most of the time he is to cultivate the land of others. Usually, a farmer is an illiterate person. He does not know how to plough his land scientifically. He cannot apply scientific method. He has only a pair of bullocks and some handmade tools. Often he does not have enough money to buy seeds, fertilizer or pesticide. As a result, he cannot produce more food for himself and his family. He lives from hand to mouth. He also has pleasures and pains in life. If he gets a good harvest, his face beams with joy. On the other hand, if the harvest is not good, his sorrows know no bounds. He works very hard to prepare the land for planting or sowing crops. As the farmers grow and reap the harvest, we have our food. By working hard in the field, he grows a bumper crop which helps develop our national economy. We know that ours is an agricultural country. More than 80 percent people are directly or indirectly engaged in agriculture. Our economy is also mostly dependent on agriculture. So, to promote the development of national economy, the farmers should be helped with agricultural subsidies by the government. They should be encouraged to use tractors instead of the age-old ploughs. They should also be taught to use the modem cultivation methods. This is how, the life of a farmer can be developed."

          "explanation": "Tree Plantation/ Importance of Trees in Our Life/Why More Trees Should Be Planted\nMen depend much on trees. Trees provide us with oxygen, food, furniture, etc. and take carbondioxide which is harmful to human beings and all animals. So to say, our life on earth largely depends upon trees. But it is a matter of great regret that we are cutting down trees very unwisely for some quick profit. It is really a matter of great concern .\nFirst, it is important to know what trees do for us. Man needs oxygen: In every breath we take oxygen in and leave carbon dioxide out. Trees leave oxygen out and take carbon dioxide in. Thus they provide us with the most necessary thing we need on earth. Trees also give us food and shelter . We cannot live without the help of trees.\nBut at present people are cutting down trees at a large scale. There are many reasons of cutting down trees. Man is cutting down them mainly for firewood and furniture. Every day our population is increasing. So, more firewood and furniture are needed for the additional people.\nTropical rain forests are also being cleared at a high rate. It takes thousands of years to grow a tropical rain forest. But, at present, they are being cleared at the rate of fourteen square miles per hour.\nOn the other hand, the effect of deforestation is very harmful and dangerous. For this, 'Greenhouse Effect' has occurred and the temperature of the world is increasing day by day. Heat waves have grasped many countries. Besides, ice is melting in the South and North Poles. The level of water in the sea is increasing on. This may lead to worldwide flood. Measures should immediately be taken to prevent deforestation. So, we should plant five trees if we cut down one. We should also try our best to stop curting down trees and save the environment. Otherwise, our future will be very difficult and uninhabitable."
