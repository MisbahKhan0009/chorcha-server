As you are aware, the common room is a vital space for students to refresh their minds and engage in recreational activities during breaks. However, the current setup is insufficient to meet the increasing needs of the students.\nThe common room lacks adequate seating arrangements, indoor game facilities, and updated newspapers and magazines. During recess, it becomes overcrowded, leaving many students without the opportunity to utilize the space effectively. This has a negative impact on our relaxation time, which is essential for maintaining focus and productivity in classes.\nWe humbly request your kind intervention to enhance the facilities in the common room by providing more chairs and tables, introducing additional indoor games like carrom and chess, and ensuring a regular supply of updated reading materials. These improvements would greatly contribute to the overall well-being and academic performance of the students.\nWe are hopeful for your understanding and prompt action in this regard.\nThank you for considering our request.\nYours faithfully,\nSumona Akter On behalf of the students Khulna Zilla School"

          "explanation": "A Winter Morning\nA winter morning is cold and foggy. Everrything seems hazy and indistinct. Grasses are wet with dew drops. However, when the sun rises, dew drops sparkle like pearls. Old people and children shiver in cold, Poor people gather straw and make fire to bask in the heat, Animals, too, are helpless. They hide themselvés in the corner of the house and try to save themselves from the biting cold outside. People get up late in the morning. Elderly people and children usually get up a bit late to evade cold of the early moming. Working people go out when the fog disappears and the sun seems brighter. People somettimes eat homemade cakes with 'date juice' and enjoy the warmth of the early sun while sitting outside their homes. Bangalees settled abroad, make it a poirit to return and spend the winter in Bangladesh. They find the winter here pleasant as the winter in any European country is tremendously. cold. A winter morning in Bangladesh is thus quite fascinating for them. My personal feeling about a winter morning is that it is a bane for the poor but a boon for the rich."
