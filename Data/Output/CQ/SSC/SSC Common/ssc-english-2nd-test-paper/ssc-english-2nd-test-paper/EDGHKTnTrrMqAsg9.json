As the world is becoming increasingly interconnected, the importance of mastering various languages has never been greater. A language club would not only enhance our communication skills but also allow us to explore diverse cultures and broaden our horizons.\nThrough a language club, students could participate in activities such as language workshops, debates, quizzes, and cultural exchange programs. Such initiatives would help improve fluency in languages like English, Bangla, and even foreign languages such as French, German, or Chinese. Moreover, it would provide an opportunity to develop confidence in public speaking, presentation, and creative writing.\nWe believe that the presence of a language club would be an asset to our school. It could inspire students to engage in academic excellence while also building a bridge to global learning opportunities. We are confident that under your guidance, the language club will thrive and positively impact the academic environment of our school.\nTherefore, we kindly request you to consider our proposal and take the necessary steps to establish a language club. We are willing to offer our cooperation to make this initiative successful.\nThank you for your attention and understanding.\nYours sincerely, Samin Class Ten [Date]"

A journey by train is especially pleasant, because it is safe and comfortable. Whenever I get a chance to travel by train, I never miss it. Last month, I enjoyed a journey by train with my family members from Dhaka to Chattogram. It was one of the most enjoyable journeys in my life.\n\nOn the scheduled day, we reached Kamalapur Railway Station early in the morning. The station was very crowded and noisy. We bought our tickets and got into the train. I managed my seat beside a window. Suddenly, the train blew its whistle and I jumped. Then the train began to move.\n\nAt first, the train was moving slowly. After a while, it began to move in full speed. Trees, houses, people, etc. all seemed going backwards. Gentle breeze began to enter our compartment. The rhythmic sound and jerking of the train made me very excited. I wanted to put my head out of the window, but my parents did not let me do that. I looked through the window and saw many beautiful sights. The paddy fields and other trees were very beautiful to look at. They were tossing their heads in the breeze. While the train was crossing a bridge, I saw some country-boats in the rivers. Sometimes, our train moved through open fields. I saw the farmers working and the children playing cricket or football there. All these gave me new and exciting experiences.\n\nOur compartment was crowded. There was no vacant seat. Some of the passengers were talking on various topics. Some were reading newspapers or magazines. Some were sleeping, too. Sometimes, hawkers came with various items. Our train made stops at a few big and small'stations. When our train entered Chattogram, I saw many hills.\n\nAt last, the train reached Chattogram station at noon. And our journey ended. The journey gave me immense pleasure and experience. I wish I could make it again and again."
