As you are aware, the common room is a vital space for students to refresh their minds and engage in recreational activities during breaks. However, the current setup is insufficient to meet the increasing needs of the students.\nThe common room lacks adequate seating arrangements, indoor game facilities, and updated newspapers and magazines. During recess, it becomes overcrowded, leaving many students without the opportunity to utilize the space effectively. This has a negative impact on our relaxation time, which is essential for maintaining focus and productivity in classes.\nWe humbly request your kind intervention to enhance the facilities in the common room by providing more chairs and tables, introducing additional indoor games like carrom and chess, and ensuring a regular supply of updated reading materials. These improvements would greatly contribute to the overall well-being and academic performance of the students.\nWe are hopeful for your understanding and prompt action in this regard.\nThank you for considering our request.\nYours faithfully,\nSumona Akter On behalf of the students Khulna Zilla School"

          "explanation": "The 21st of February, known as International Mother Language Day, holds great significance in the history of Bangladesh. This day commemorates the 1952 Language Movement, when students and citizens of Dhaka protested against the Pakistani government's decision to impose Urdu as the sole national language. In their efforts to uphold the Bengali language, a tragic incident occurred, and several young students were killed during the protests on the streets of Dhaka. These sacrifices marked a crucial turning point in the national consciousness of Bangladesh, strengthening the struggle for linguistic and cultural identity. The day is observed not only in Bangladesh but around the world, reminding people of the importance of preserving their mother language as a means of preserving cultural heritage and identity.\nIn Bangladesh, the 21st of February is observed with reverence. People from all walks of life gather at the Shaheed Minar in Dhaka, paying homage to the martyrs who lost their lives in 1952. The government and various organizations organize seminars, cultural programs, and educational activities. Schools and universities across the country emphasize the significance of mother language and its role in education. The events of that day helped foster a greater sense of unity in the nation, and the 21st February continues to serve as a reminder of the strength of collective action in the face of adversity. It is a day of pride for Bengalis around the world, as they honor both the language and the brave souls who fought for it."

          "question": "",
          "explanation": "My hobby is reading books, and it is one of the most cherished and enriching activities I engage in. Since I was young, I’ve been drawn to the world that books open up to readers. Every time I pick up a book, it feels like entering a new universe, one filled with endless possibilities. Whether the book is fiction or non-fiction, reading has always been a way for me to connect with different ideas, cultures, and experiences.\nThe greatest aspect of reading is the way it stimulates my imagination. It enables me to step into the shoes of people from different walks of life, learn about far-off places, and get immersed in stories of courage, triumph, and even despair. Fiction has the magical ability to allow me to explore realms beyond reality—whether it be fantasy worlds filled with magic, futuristic societies, or historical settings that paint a vivid picture of different times. Authors take us through intense journeys, where every plot twist, character’s choice, and unexpected turn adds depth to the narrative. It makes me think critically and helps in improving my ability to see various perspectives.\nApart from fiction, I also enjoy reading non-fiction, particularly books related to history, science, and philosophy. Through these genres, I gather knowledge that not only broadens my worldview but also allows me to engage in insightful discussions. History books take me back in time, shedding light on past civilizations, influential leaders, and pivotal events that shaped the world as we know it. Learning about different cultures and the struggles they’ve faced helps me become more empathetic toward others. Meanwhile, books on science and philosophy push the boundaries of my understanding of the natural world and human existence. I find it exciting to learn how theories and discoveries have advanced over time and how they impact the world today.\nReading is also a great escape for me. In moments of stress or when I feel overwhelmed by life’s demands, opening a book becomes an instant remedy. The immersion in a well-written novel or an intriguing subject allows me to detach from any worries, providing me with much-needed relaxation and mental clarity. Sometimes, a few hours spent lost in a captivating story can completely rejuvenate my spirit, leaving me with new energy and focus.\nOne of my favorite genres is mystery. I find thrillers particularly exciting—books with intricate plots and well-developed characters that challenge my intellect. The thrill of solving a crime or understanding an enigma before the book reveals the solution is both stimulating and rewarding. Mystery books encourage me to think critically, analyze evidence, and weigh possibilities. It’s like becoming part of a detective team in solving a puzzle, and I deeply enjoy this mental challenge.\nOver time, reading has helped me develop many skills. It has improved my vocabulary, enhanced my writing abilities, and has expanded my knowledge base. These improvements have greatly influenced my performance in school and allowed me to express my thoughts clearly in both written and spoken forms. But more importantly, it has cultivated a lifelong love for learning. I realize that with every book, I open myself up to new ideas and perspectives, which shapes my understanding of the world.\nThrough reading, I have learned about perseverance, empathy, critical thinking, and the importance of knowing one’s past. These lessons go beyond the pages of any book and continue to shape my approach to life. Reading is, to me, not just a hobby but a way of growing—mentally, emotionally, and intellectually. Whether it’s in my quiet room or on a bus during my travels, I never leave home without a book. This hobby will always remain close to my heart, and I hope it stays with me for the rest of my life."
