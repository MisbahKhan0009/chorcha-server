          "explanation": "Causes and Effects of Road Accident\n\nRoad accident has become a daily occurrence in our country. It has increased in number considerably in recent years. The real causes of road accidents lie with the, people and not with the mechanised means of transport. Reckless driving and overtaking tendency of the drivers are responsible for most of the accidents. The drivers drive their motorised vehicles at breakneck speed. Sometimes, they lose control over steering that leads to accidents. Violation of traffic rales by both the pedestrians and the drivers also causes road accidents. The situation becomes worse when the slow-moving rickshaws and carts tussle with cars, buses and trucks. In some cities, roads are too narrow and inadequate. These can hardly cope with the ever-increasing volume of traffic. Mechanical failures, including faulty brakes and bald tyres also result in fatal açcidents. Every year, thousands of people die and many more get injured in road accidents. Sometimes, the injured have to embrace disability forever. Road accidents also cause material losses including waste of money for the treatment of the injured and repairing the vehicles. The consequences of road accident leave a lasting impact on the individuals and their family. In the long run, a road accident affects the economy of the country: Road accidents have become a great menace in our society. Stern steps must be taken to check this danger. Spacious roads should be constructed and traffic signals should be set up at the key points. Heavy penalty should be imposed on those who violate the traffic rules. Moreover, common people should be made aware of the traffic rules through radio, television, newspapers and posters. If the city administrations work sincerely, the number of road accidents is sure to come down."
