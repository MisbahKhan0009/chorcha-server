          "explanation": "Water Pollution\nThe pollution refers to the contamination of something that makes it harmful for human health and unsuitable to be used. Water pollution means making water harmful and contaminated by throwing waste, filth, etc. into it. The another name of water is life it is our life – savior. Water is used not only for drinking purpose but also for household works, agriculture and industrial works in our daily life.\nWe cannot think of our existence on earth for a moment without drinking water. Water is essential for our life. But water is polluted in many ways in our country every day. Only human beings are mostly responsible for it in our social life. Man pollutes water by throwing waste into it and making unsanitary latrines by the bank of the rivers or canals. Farmers use chemical fertilizers and insecticides in their fields.\nThese are washed away by flood or rain water and pollute the nearby rivers, canals and ponds water regularly in our daily life. Mills and factories throw their wastes and poisonous chemicals into rivers and pollute the water. Steamers, launches even sail boats can polluted water by throwing burning oil, food waste and human waste into the rivers and canals. By drinking polluted water we become ill. Cholera, typhoid, dysentery and other water – borne diseases attack us greatly if we drink polluted water in our daily life.\nAll the fishes die, even farming becomes impossible in severely in polluted water. We can prevent water pollution by careful waste management in our country strongly. Farmers should use organic fertilizer  instead of chemical fertilizer in the crop fields.In addiction it can be told that water is life and life is water so the Government and all classes of people of our country be much conscious about water pollution in our daily life and we have to keep it free from pollution in our day to day life."

          "explanation": "The Duties of a Student\nStudent life is the most useful and valuable period in a man's life. This is the time when the seeds of future life are sown. For this, it is called the sowing season in our life. During this period, a student has to do certain things to be successful and happy in his future life. The principal duty of a student is to study and acquire knowledge on various things. He must study according to a routine. He has to be attentive to his studies and teachers. He should also read newspapers, magazines, literature, history, etc.\nA student should remember that character is the crown of a man: Therefore, he has to cultivate good manners and other noble virtues. All moral qualities like honesty, modesty, truthfulness, discipline, perseverance, sincerity, punctuality must be acquired during this time.\nHe should also render some services to his society and country. He should make the illiterate literate. He can make the farmers aware of the modern methods of cultivation. In population control, he can play an important role.\nA student must obey and honour his parents. When they are sick, helpless or old, he must serve them, He should-also be obedient to his teachers and other superiors.\nA student must not waste his time and energy. So, he must possess a sound health by taking regular physical exercise, taking part in games and sports. Moreover, he must always avoid evil company.\nBesides, a student may have the knowledge of politics but he must not take part in active politics. It is because many political parties and their unethical leaders use them only for their selfish interest.\nIn case of national emergencies like floods, tornadoes, storms, etc. he must not sit idle. He must extend his helping hands during these crucial times.\nTo reap the good and expected harvest of success in future, a student must sow good seeds during his student life. Otherwise it will bring him utter failure, untold sorrows, miseries and repentance."
