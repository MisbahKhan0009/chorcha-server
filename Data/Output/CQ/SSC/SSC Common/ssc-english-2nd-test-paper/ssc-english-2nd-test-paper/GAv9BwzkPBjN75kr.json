          "explanation": "A School Magazine\nA school magazine contains the literary works and other information of a school. It is published once a year. To publish it smoothly, a magazine committee of usually nine members is formed in a general meeting. The members of the committee are chief patron, adviser, editor, assistant, editors, business editors, proofreaders, assistant proofreaders, etc. Generally, the Headteacher holds the post of chief patron and a senior teacher becomes the adviser. The editor, business editors and the assistant proofreaders are selected from the students. A magazine fund is also made up of the school 'Magazine Fee'. The editor invites writings both in Bangla and English. Then, after proper scrutiny, the best ones are selected for publishing. The business editors collect some money by selling spaces in the magazine for advertisements. Generally, the magazine has two sections - Bangla and English. There are messages from the Headteacher and the secretary ofthe school, annual reports, essays, short stories, short plays, etc. in it. It also 'contains jokes, quizzes and puzzles, etc. Most of the articles are written by the students. Besides, a few articles are contributed by the teachers. A school magazine promotes team-spirit, fosters to express the dormant power of thinking as well as writing of the young learners. It also helps flourish themselves as future writers and poets."

          "explanation": "My Favourite Hobby\nHobby. means one's favourite pastime. Usually, hobby is not meant to support someone financially, but a way to derive pleasure out of it. Without it, life becomes dull and monotonous.\nDifferent people have different hobbies. Some choose gardening, some like drawing picture; on the other hand, some may like rearing birds or catching fish, collecting stamps and so on. But whatever is the hobby, it has its own uniqueness and one chooses his or her hobby on the basis of what he or she enjoys most. My favourite hobby is gardening. I love flowers very much. So, I have made a flower garden. It is in front of our house. I have planted the seedlings of roses, jasmine, sunflower, China rose, cosmos, marigold, beli, etc. in my garden. In a corner of the garden, I also grow some seasonal vegetables. I have put a strong bamboo-made fence around my garden so that cattle or other animals cannot enter the garden and do any harm to the plants.\nMy garden is a great source of passing my leisure time. Every day, I work in my garden for some time. In the morning, I water the plants, make the soil loose and weed out the grasses. In the evening, I water the plants again. On holidays, I pass some time there too. I truly love my hobby; it keeps me happy and cheerful. When I get bored with my studies or other works, I go to my garden. The pleasant sight of the garden and the sweet fragrance of the flowers remove my boredom. It is a great source of joy and recreation for me. When various colourful flowers bloom, my garden looks like a paradise. Most importantly, my hobby never hampers my study. My hobby is very beneficial to me. Before I made the garden, I used to feel sick all the time. I lost my appetite and became very weak. But when I started working in my garden, my health began to improve. Besides, the vegetables in my garden also provide nutrition to our family and in the way save some money for my parents.\nA hobby is necessary for all of us. But we must not spend too much time in pursuit of our hobby. We must perform our main tasks first and then we should spend our leisure time pursuing our hobby.\nTherefore, the government should put some restrictions on the telecast of the satellite TV channels. Guardians should encourage their children to watch the channels which telecast educational programmes. We must motivate our youths to take the good things from satellite TV channels and avoid the bad things. Family and educational institutions can play a major role in this regard."
