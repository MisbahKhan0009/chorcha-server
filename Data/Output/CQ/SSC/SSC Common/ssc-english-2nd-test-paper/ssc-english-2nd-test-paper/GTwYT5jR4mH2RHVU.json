          "explanation": "Digital Addiction\nModern technology has revolutionized our lives by introducing various digital devices that are now integral to our daily routines. However, the overuse of these devices has led to a growing concern called digital addiction. From smartphones to tablets and laptops, people of all ages, from young children to the elderly, spend excessive amounts of time on digital screens. This addiction impacts physical health by causing issues such as eye strain, poor posture, and lack of exercise. It also takes a toll on mental well-being, leading to anxiety, depression, and disrupted sleep patterns. Children are often the most affected, losing interest in outdoor activities and face-to-face interactions. Adults, too, face reduced productivity due to endless scrolling and online distractions. While digital devices are essential for communication, education, and work, their uncontrolled use disconnects individuals from real-life relationships and experiences. To combat digital addiction, conscious efforts must be made, such as setting screen time limits, encouraging offline activities, and fostering digital detox habits. Balance is key to ensuring technology enhances our lives instead of controlling them."

          "explanation": "\n\nStudents and Social Services Or, Service Rendered by the Students to Build up Our Nation\n\nStudents are the future leaders and makers of a nation. They are the devotees in the temple of learning. So, the most important duty of students is to study seriously with devotion. It does not mean that they are isolated from the-society. They are also social beings like other classes of people. They enjoy the same social benefits, rights and privileges. So, as members of society, they have certain duties to the society in which they live in. There are many kinds of social services and students have a lot to do in these sectors.\n\nLiving in a developing country like ours, students must render some social services for the development and welfare of the nation. So during the long vacation and leisure time, students can open night schools and teach the illiterate working children and adult people. They can also teach the farmers about the modern methods of cultivation, the use of fertilizers and proper caring of crops. They can also suggest them to dig a pond for fish cultivation or to make a farm. .\n\nStudents can render immense service in the field of health. The village people and the people living in the slums have. no knowledge about health, nutrition and sanitation. The students can teach them about the basic rules of health, nutrition and sanitation. Female? students can also teach the uneducated women how to keep their houses neat and clean, how to bring up children and look after their health.\n\nStudents can prove themselves to be worthy citizens during natural disasters. In times of flood, famine and cyclone, earthquake and epidemic, they can come forward to help the affected people. They can collect money from the rich, rescue the affected, feed the hungry, nurse the sick and clothe the unclothed. During epidemics, medical students can serve the sick with food, clothes and medicine.\n"
