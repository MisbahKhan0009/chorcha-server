We have good academic records. But it is a matter of regret that we cannot compete with other schools in terms of the use of modern technology in classrooms.' Our classes have traditional arrangements while many schools in our district are providing multimedia facilities in their classrooms. But it is very necessary for our school to be up-to-date with modern amenities of technology. We cannot even learn many things for not having modern classroom settings. As a result, we are lagging behind in comparison to other schools.\nWe, therefore, hope that you would kindly take necessary steps so that we can have multimedia facilities with internet connection in our classrooms and oblige thereby:\nI remain\nSir\nYours sincerely,\nMilon Mahmud\nOn behalf of Pragati Bidya Niketon"

          "question": "",
          "explanation": "Water Pollution\n\nWater pollution is one of the most pressing environmental issues, posing significant threats to ecosystems, human health, and global sustainability. It occurs when harmful substances such as chemicals, plastics, sewage, and industrial waste contaminate water bodies like rivers, lakes, oceans, and groundwater. These pollutants disrupt aquatic ecosystems, endangering the plants and animals that depend on clean water for survival. Toxic substances can kill marine life or accumulate in the food chain, ultimately affecting humans who consume seafood.\nOne major contributor to water pollution is industrial discharge, which introduces hazardous chemicals and heavy metals into waterways. Agricultural activities also play a significant role, as the use of pesticides and fertilizers leads to runoff that contaminates nearby rivers and streams. This runoff causes nutrient pollution, triggering algal blooms that deplete oxygen levels in water, creating dead zones where aquatic life cannot survive.\nIn urban areas, untreated sewage and plastic waste exacerbate the problem, clogging waterways and harming marine life. Polluted water sources also pose severe health risks to humans, including waterborne diseases like cholera, dysentery, and typhoid. Additionally, microplastics in water are now being detected in human tissues, raising concerns about long-term health impacts.\nWater pollution also undermines access to clean drinking water, a fundamental human right. With freshwater resources already limited, pollution further exacerbates scarcity, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations. Addressing water pollution requires stricter regulations, sustainable practices, advanced waste treatment technologies, and global cooperation to ensure clean water for future generations."

          "explanation": "\nA Journey I have recently Enjoyed Or, A Journey by Train\n\nA journey is always pleasurable to me. A journey by train is especially pleasant, because it is safe and comfortable. Whenever I get a chance to travel by train, I never miss it. Last month, I enjoyed a journey by train with my family members from Dhaka to Chattogram. It was one of the most enjoyable journeys in my life.\n\nOn the scheduled day, we reached Kamalapur Railway Station early in the morning. The station was very crowded and noisy. We bought our tickets and got into the train. I managed my seat beside a window. Suddenly, the train blew its whistle and I jumped. Then the train began to move.\n\nAt first, the train was moving slowly. After a while, it began to move in full speed. Trees, houses, people, etc. all seemed going backwards. Gentle breeze began to enter our compartment. The rhythmic sound and jerking of the train made me very excited. I wanted to put my head out of the window, but my parents did not let me do that. I looked through the window and saw many beautiful sights. The paddy fields and other trees were very beautiful to look at. They were tossing their heads in the breeze. While the train was crossing a bridge, I saw some country-boats in the rivers. Sometimes, our train moved through open fields. I saw the farmers working and the children playing cricket or football there. All these gave me new and exciting experiences.\n\nOur compartment was crowded. There was no vacant seat. Some of the passengers were talking on various topics. Some were reading newspapers or magazines. Some were sleeping, too. Sometimes, hawkers came with various items. Our train made stops at a few big and small'stations. When our train entered Chattogram, I saw many hills.\n\nAt last, the train reached Chattogram station at noon. And our journey ended. The journey gave me immense pleasure and experience. I wish I could make it again and again."
