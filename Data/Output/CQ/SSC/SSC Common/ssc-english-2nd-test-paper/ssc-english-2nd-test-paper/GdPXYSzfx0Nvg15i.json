We have good academic records. But it is a matter of regret that we cannot compete with other schools in terms of the use of modern technology in classrooms.' Our classes have traditional arrangements while many schools in our district are providing multimedia facilities in their classrooms. But it is very necessary for our school to be up-to-date with modern amenities of technology. We cannot even learn many things for not having modern classroom settings. As a result, we are lagging behind in comparison to other schools.\nWe, therefore, hope that you would kindly take necessary steps so that we can have multimedia facilities with internet connection in our classrooms and oblige thereby:\nI remain\nSir\nYours sincerely,\nMilon Mahmud\nOn behalf of Pragati Bidya Niketon"

          "explanation": "The Bad Impacts of Deforestation\nDeforestation, or the cutting down of trees on a large scale, has serious and long-lasting impacts on the environment. Trees are one of the most important gifts of nature. They provide us with oxygen, maintain the balance of carbon dioxide, and help regulate the Earth's temperature. When trees are destroyed, this balance is disturbed, leading to global warming and climate change. Deforestation also increases the risk of natural disasters such as floods, landslides, and droughts. Trees hold the soil together, so when they are removed, the land becomes more prone to erosion. Moreover, forests are home to countless species of animals and birds. Destroying forests means destroying their natural habitat, which often leads to the extinction of many species. It also affects rainfall patterns, resulting in less rainfall and desertification in some areas. In addition, deforestation causes a rise in air pollution as there are fewer trees to absorb harmful gases. People who depend on forests for their livelihood are also affected. In short, deforestation poses a serious threat to both nature and human life. To protect our environment and ensure a sustainable future, we must take immediate steps to stop deforestation and encourage afforestation."

It was a trip to Cox’s Bazar, the longest sea beach in the world. I went there with my family during the winter vacation. We had been planning the trip for a long time, and finally, it became a reality.\nWe started our journey early in the morning from Chattogram by bus. The weather was pleasant, and the roads were smooth. The scenic beauty on both sides of the road added more charm to the trip. After a journey of about five hours, we reached our destination.\nThe moment we arrived at the beach, I was amazed by the vast stretch of golden sand and the roaring waves of the sea. We spent the whole day walking along the shore, collecting seashells, and enjoying the cool breeze. In the evening, the sunset over the sea was a breathtaking sight.\nThe next day, we visited Himchori and Inani Beach, which were equally beautiful. I also tasted some delicious seafood. The journey was refreshing, and I felt close to nature. It was truly a memorable experience, and I hope to visit again someday."
