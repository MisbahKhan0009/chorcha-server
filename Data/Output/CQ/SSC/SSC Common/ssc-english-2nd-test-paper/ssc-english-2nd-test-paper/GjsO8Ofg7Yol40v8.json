As soon as I entered the fairground, I was greeted by a sea of books, vibrant stalls, and excited book lovers. The atmosphere was buzzing with energy, and it was clear that literature had brought people together. The smell of freshly printed books, combined with the chatter of visitors discussing their favorite authors, made it a truly magical experience.\nI wandered through the aisles, exploring a wide array of genres, from fiction and non-fiction to poetry and academic texts. The fair was a paradise for bookworms like me, with so many new releases by both renowned and budding authors. I was particularly thrilled to find a selection of books by some of my favorite writers, including a few that had just been launched. It was heartwarming to witness how local authors are receiving recognition and how their works are finding a wider audience.\nThe fair was not just about buying books; it was also a place to interact with writers and fellow readers. I had the chance to attend a few book launches and author talks, where I could hear directly from the creators about their writing journeys. These interactions were enriching and made me appreciate the hard work and creativity that go into making a book.\nOverall, my visit to the Amar Ekushey Book Fair was a celebration of literature, creativity, and culture. It reminded me of the importance of reading and how books have the power to connect us all. I left the fair not only with a bag full of books but also with a sense of gratitude for being part of such a wonderful literary event."

          "explanation": "My Future Plan of Life\nMan aims for his future. An aimless life is like a boat without a rudder (মাস্তুলবিহীন জাহাজ) that can never reach - (পৌছা) its goal (গন্তব্য). To succeed in life one should have a future plan (ভবিষ্যৎ পরিকল্পনা) fron. one's early life (শৈশবকাল). This is called an aim in life. Therefore, it can be said that one's aim is one's future plan for life.\nNow I am a student. I believe that this period is a unique opportunity (সুযোগ) to do something and to succeed in life.\nI have decided to be a teacher. I know it is a very hard task. But I want to develop my nation. A teacher can lead the nation to the highest stage of prosperity (উন্নতি) if he can properly teach the students with his ideals.\nI want to serve the nation through proper teaching. A good teacher lives in the mind of the people of a nation forever. Our nation is a poor one. Illiteracy is a vital cause of our poverty. It is the root of all of our obstacles (বাধা). If our students are properly educated, they can alleviate (দূর করা) our poverty. By being a teacher, I am determined (দৃঢ় সংকল্প) to serve the nation.\nIn order to fulfil my future plan, I must acquire some degrees. I sympathise (সহমর্মিতা) all students who fail in English. So, I want to be a teacher of English. After passing my HSC Examination, I will get myself admitted into Honour's in English. After completing my Honour's and Master's degrees, I shall join a college to teach the students with my best effort. I would like to choose a rural area as my working place.\nI would like to serve my country sincerely. The condition of English in our country is very poor. I would like to improve it. If our nation is capable enough to communicate (যোগাযোগ) internationally, she can easily reach her destination (গন্তব্য) to prosperity. Though English is a foreign language, we hardly can do anything without it in this age, I shall teach my students the four skills of language listening (শ্রবণ), speaking (বলা), reading (পড়া) and writing (লিখন) within the shortest possible time.\nI pray to Allah for the success of my future plan. I have been studying heart and soul to build up a strong background of English in me. Apart from the school texts, I regularly go through English newspapers, magazines, periodicals, journals, etc. to improve my stock of vocabulary. I hope I shall be able to translate my aim or future plan into reality by the grace of Allah."
