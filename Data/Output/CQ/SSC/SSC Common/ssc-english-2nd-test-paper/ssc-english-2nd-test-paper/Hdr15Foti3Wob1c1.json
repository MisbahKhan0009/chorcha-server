As you are aware, the common room is a vital space for students to refresh their minds and engage in recreational activities during breaks. However, the current setup is insufficient to meet the increasing needs of the students.\nThe common room lacks adequate seating arrangements, indoor game facilities, and updated newspapers and magazines. During recess, it becomes overcrowded, leaving many students without the opportunity to utilize the space effectively. This has a negative impact on our relaxation time, which is essential for maintaining focus and productivity in classes.\nWe humbly request your kind intervention to enhance the facilities in the common room by providing more chairs and tables, introducing additional indoor games like carrom and chess, and ensuring a regular supply of updated reading materials. These improvements would greatly contribute to the overall well-being and academic performance of the students.\nWe are hopeful for your understanding and prompt action in this regard.\nThank you for considering our request.\nYours faithfully,\nSumona Akter On behalf of the students Khulna Zilla School"

          "explanation": "Our National Flag\n\nA national flag is the symbol of independence and sovereignty of a country. Every free nation of the world has its own national flag. It introduces a country to the whole world. As a free nation, we also have a national flag of our own. We achieved this flag through a bloody war against the Pakistani military forces in 1971. The shape of our national flag is rectangular. The ratio of its length and width is 10 : 6 10: 6 10 : 6 . It is made of cotton, linen or silk. It bears a combination of two colours. The major part of it is deep green and there is a red circle in the middle of it. The radius of the circle is one-fifth of the length of the flag. Its deep green colour stands for everlasting youth, freshness and vigour of our nation. It also symbolises the greenery of Bangladesh. On the other hand, the red circle symbolises the rising sun of independence. It also stands for the supreme sacrifices of our heroic freedom fighters, who laid down their lives for the independence of our motherland. The flag is hoisted everyday on the top of government buildings, educational institutions and offices. Moreover, it is hoisted everywhere on the Independent Day and the Victory Day. Besides, it is kept half-mast on our national mourning days. Our national flag is the source of our spirit, hope, and aspiration. So, we must defend our independence at any cost and save the existence and prestige of our national flag."
