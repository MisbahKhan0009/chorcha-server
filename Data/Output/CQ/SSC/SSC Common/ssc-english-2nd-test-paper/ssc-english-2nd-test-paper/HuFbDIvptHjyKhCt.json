As the world is becoming increasingly interconnected, the importance of mastering various languages has never been greater. A language club would not only enhance our communication skills but also allow us to explore diverse cultures and broaden our horizons.\nThrough a language club, students could participate in activities such as language workshops, debates, quizzes, and cultural exchange programs. Such initiatives would help improve fluency in languages like English, Bangla, and even foreign languages such as French, German, or Chinese. Moreover, it would provide an opportunity to develop confidence in public speaking, presentation, and creative writing.\nWe believe that the presence of a language club would be an asset to our school. It could inspire students to engage in academic excellence while also building a bridge to global learning opportunities. We are confident that under your guidance, the language club will thrive and positively impact the academic environment of our school.\nTherefore, we kindly request you to consider our proposal and take the necessary steps to establish a language club. We are willing to offer our cooperation to make this initiative successful.\nThank you for your attention and understanding.\nYours sincerely, Samin Class Ten [Date]"

          "explanation": "A school magazine contains (থাকে) the literary (সাহিত্যবিষয়ক) works and other information (তথ্য) of a school. It is published once a year. To publish it smoothly (সুচারুভাবে), a magazine committee of usually nine members is formed in a general meeting. The members of the committee are chief patron (পৃষ্ঠপোষক), adviser (উপদেষ্টা), editor, assistant editors, business editors, proofreaders, assistant proofreaders, etc. Generally, the Headteacher holds the post of chief patron and a senior teacher becomes the adviser. The editor, business editors and the assistant proofreaders are selected from the students. A magazine fund (তহবিল) is also made up (গঠন করা হয়) of the school 'Magazine Fee'. The editor invites (আহ্বান করে) writings both in Bangla and English. Then, after proper scrutiny (স্কুটিনি-নিরীক্ষণ), the best ones are selected for publishing. The business editors collect some money by selling spaces (স্থান) in the magazine for advertisements. Generally, the magazine has two sections - Bangla and English. There are messages (বাণী) from the Headteacher and the secretary (সচিব) of the school, annual reports, essays, short stories, short plays, etc. in it. It also contains jokes, quizzes (ধাঁধা) and puzzles (শব্দ ধাঁধা), etc. Most of the articles (বিষয়) are written by the students. Besides, a few articles are contributed (প্রদান করা) by the teachers. A school magazine promotes (উন্নয়ন করা) team-spirit (দলীয় উদ্দীপনা), fosters (উৎসাহিত করে) to express the dormant power of thinking as well as writing of the young learners. It also helps flourish (বিকশিত হওয়া) themselves as future writers and poets."

          "explanation": "Wonders of Modern Science\nScience means knowledge gained through experiment and research. Science does many things for the development of human civilization. The modern age is a gift of science. We are passing our days under the great influence of science.\nWe see the influence of science at every step of our life. It has changed the way we live. It has invented many things for our comfort. Today we feel the presence of science in our everyday life. The pen we write with, the shirt we put on, the bicycle we ride all are the invention of science. With the touch of a switch, we get our lights dazzling, fans whirling and radios and televisions singing and talking.\nThe invention of electricity has brought about a revolutionary change in the history of human civilization. Electricity helps to operate machine, factories and other heavy industries. Electric fans, lights, and heaters have made our life more enjoyable.\nMoreover, our agricultural and industrial development is fully dependent on modern science. We now cultivate our farnd with power tillers. The production of crops is increasing day by day with the help of. chemical fertilizers and insecticides. Science also helps us in inventing new hybrid seeds. In industrial areas, science has made a significant contribution. From needles to rockets, everything produced in industry is the contribution of science.\nCommunication is considered the motion of life.\nScience has brought about a great change in our communication system also. Invention of speedy transports like bus, train, airplane, truck, ship etc. has made transportation faster and comfortable. Rocket and space shuttle are great wonders of modern science. By using them; man has already conquered the moon and is now preparing for the Mars. Besides, satellite television has added a new dimension to our communication system. It has brought the whole world to our living room. Moreover, telephone, FAX, E-mail, cellular phone, and internet have turned the whole world into a global village. We can instantly communicate with our friends and family through them.\nIn the medical field, science has done unbelievable improvements. Blood transfusion and transplantation of other organs have become possible with the help of science. The invention of X-ray, ECG, Ultrasonography, penicillin, CT scan, biopsy, various life-saving antibiotic, etc. has worked wonders in the field of medical science. Modern medical science has given eyes to the blind, hearing to the deaf, legs to the lame and what not.\nHowever, the inventions of science could also be destructive also if they are misused. By inventing atom bomb, hydrogen bomb, missiles, and other explosives, men are now destroying the human race and its beautiful creation in the world. The destruction caused by dropping atom bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II bears testimony to it.\nIn conclusion, the wonders of science cannot be described in words. But if it is misused, it brings destruction. So, it should be utilised for the greater benefit of human beings."
