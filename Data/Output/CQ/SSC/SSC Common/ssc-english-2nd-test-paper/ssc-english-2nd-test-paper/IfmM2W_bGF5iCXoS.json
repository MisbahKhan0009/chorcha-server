As the world is becoming increasingly interconnected, the importance of mastering various languages has never been greater. A language club would not only enhance our communication skills but also allow us to explore diverse cultures and broaden our horizons.\nThrough a language club, students could participate in activities such as language workshops, debates, quizzes, and cultural exchange programs. Such initiatives would help improve fluency in languages like English, Bangla, and even foreign languages such as French, German, or Chinese. Moreover, it would provide an opportunity to develop confidence in public speaking, presentation, and creative writing.\nWe believe that the presence of a language club would be an asset to our school. It could inspire students to engage in academic excellence while also building a bridge to global learning opportunities. We are confident that under your guidance, the language club will thrive and positively impact the academic environment of our school.\nTherefore, we kindly request you to consider our proposal and take the necessary steps to establish a language club. We are willing to offer our cooperation to make this initiative successful.\nThank you for your attention and understanding.\nYours sincerely, Samin Class Ten [Date]"

          "explanation": "The Life of a Farmer\n\nA farmer is the person, who cultivates lands and grows different types of crops to earn his bread. Generally, a farmer is a poor man and lives in the village. In Bangladesh, the life of a farmer is pitiable. Most of the farmers have no land of their own. So, most of the time he is to cultivate the land of others. Usually, a farmer is an illiterate person. He does not know how to plough his land scientifically. He cannot apply scientific method. He has only a pair of bullocks and some handmade tools. Often he does not have enough money to buy seeds, fertilizer or pesticide. As a result, he cannot produce more food for himself and his family. He lives from hand to mouth. He also has pleasures and pains in life. If he gets a good harvest, his face beams with joy. On the other hand, if the harvest is not good, his sorrows know no bounds. He works very hard to prepare the land for planting or sowing crops. As the farmers grow and reap the harvest, we have our food. By working hard in the field, he grows a bumper crop which helps develop our national economy. We know that ours is an agricultural country. More than 80 percent people are directly or indirectly engaged in agriculture. Our economy is also mostly dependent on agriculture. So, to promote the development of national economy, the farmers should be helped with agricultural subsidies by the government. They should be encouraged to use tractors instead of the age-old ploughs. They should also be taught to use the modem cultivation methods. This is how, the life of a farmer can be developed."

Sitting in our room, we can know the situation of the world. The social, economic, cultural and political situations of a country are expressed in newspapers. By reading newspapers the people of a country can also know the details of different countries of the world. So, newspaper is called the storchouse of knowledge.\n\nHowever, many of us are very fond of reading newspapers. We cannot think of a single ∘ { }^{\\circ} ∘ morning without having a newspaper and a cup of hot tea. It is too much favourite an item for us. There are various types of news in it. It carries news from all sides and of all topics of the world. Choosing columns depends on one's own mentality. So, while reading newspapers, someone opens the first page and another the last one. There are the writings of the remarkable writers in it. It bears daily information, tragic scenes, news of development activities, remarkable incidents, weather forecast and so on. It is said that newspapers are the scale to understand the standard of a nation.\n\nSometimes many odd or false pieces of information are also published in newspapers. This is called yellow journalism that results in great problems in a country. So, the authorities or writers must be conscious of the interests of a country, otherwise it may hamper national and international relations.\n\nAt last, it can be said that in developing intemational relations, newspapers act as a medium. They also offer various advertisements of jobs. So, they are helpful for removing unemployment problems. The stories and novels give us much pleasure. So, considering all these, we find that reading newspapers is very great indeed."
