A good teacher is patient, understanding, and empathetic, always willing to listen to their students and offer guidance. They create a positive and encouraging learning environment where students feel comfortable asking questions, making mistakes, and growing. Such teachers are well-prepared, organized, and passionate about the subjects they teach, and they make learning enjoyable by using creative methods and real-life examples. Beyond academics, a good teacher also helps shape a student's character by teaching important values such as respect, responsibility, and perseverance. They play a vital role in building a student’s confidence, nurturing their curiosity, and instilling a love for learning that lasts a lifetime. Ultimately, a good teacher leaves a lasting impact on their students, not only in the classroom but also in their lives."

For this, we should sit to study when it is time for study, play when it is time for it etc.\nTime once gone, is gone forever. It cannot be called back at any cost. Lost wealth, lost knowledge or lost health may be regained. But lost time is lost forever; it is not retainable. It is always moving onward very fast. It never waits for anybody.
