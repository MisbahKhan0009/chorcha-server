She is one of the most beautiful countries of the world. Bangladesh is situated in south-east Asia. She borders with India on three sides and the Bay of Bengal to her south. Dhaka is our capital city. Her total land area is 148,460 square kilometres. She is an overpopulated country. The total population is more than 170 million and the density of population is almost 1000.per square kilometre. Ours is mainly an agricultural country. Most of our people are farmers. Various kinds of crops like rice, jute, sugarcane, etc. grow here in plenty. The Padma, the Meghna and the Jamuna are our main rivers. Our prominent poets are Kazi Nazruļ Islam, Michael Madhusudan Dutt, Jasimuddin and Jibanananda Das. Kazi Nazrul Islam is our national poet. Bangladesh is a country of great natural beauty with greeneries, plants and trees. The Sundarbans is our unique mangrove forest. Our Cox's Bazar sea beach is the longest sea-beach in the world. We have many attractive historical places and tourist spots. Mahasthanghar, Sonargaon, the Shat Gambuj Masjid, Kuakata, Jaflong, and Lalmai Maynamati are some of the attractive tourist spots in Bangladesh. Moreover, we have a lot of natural resources. But it is an irony of fate that poverty is a great problem for the country."

          "explanation": "Duties of a Student\nOr, Student Life\n\nStudent life is the most useful and valuable period in a person's life. This is the time when the seeds of future life are sown. For this, it is called the sowing season in our lives. During this period, a student has to do certain things to be successful and happy in his future life\nThe principal duty of a student is to study and acquire knowledge on various things. He must study according to a routine. He has to be attentive to his studies and teachers. He should also read newspapers, magazines, literature, history, etc.\nA student should remember that character is the crown of a man. Therefore, he has to cultivate good manners and other noble virtues. All moral qualities like honesty, modesty, truthfulness, discipline, perseverance, sincerity, and punctuality must be acquired during this time.\nHe should also render some services to his society and country. He should make the illiterate literate. He can make the farmers aware of the modern methods of cultivation. In population control, he can play an important role.\nA student must obey and honour his parents. When they are sick, helpless or old, he must serve them. He should also be obedient to his teachers and other superiors.\nA student must not waste his time and energy. So, he must possess a sound health by taking regular physical exercise, taking part in games and sports. Moreover, he must always avoid evil company.\nBesides, a student may have the knowledge of politics but he must not take part in active politics. It is because many political parties and their unethical leaders use them only for their selfish interest.\nIn case of. national emergencies like floods, tornadoes, storms, etc. he must not sit idle. He must extend his helping hands during these crucial times. To reap the good and expected harvest of success in future, a student must sow good seeds during his student life. Otherwise it will bring him utter failure, untold sorrows, misęries and repentance."
