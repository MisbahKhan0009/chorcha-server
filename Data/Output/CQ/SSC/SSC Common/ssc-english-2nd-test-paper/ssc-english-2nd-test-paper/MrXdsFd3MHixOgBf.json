But there is no canteen in our school campus. Many of us come to school from distant places. Often our classes continue from 10 am to 4 pm. To pass this long time, we need a good tiffin. Most often we have to take tiffin from roadside restaurants. These restaurants are not only expensive but also unhygienic.\nWe, therefore, hope that you would be kind enough to take steps to set up a canteen in the school campus for the betterment of the students.\n\nObediently yours,\nRahim\nRoll No. 1 Class-9\nOn behalf of the students of\nBarishal Zilla School"

          "explanation": "Environment Pollution\n\nThe environment refers to the air, water and land in which people, animals and plants live. Human beings, animals, plants, air, water and soil are the main elements of the environment. These elements should be pollution free for our healthy living. But when they are polluted and their balance is disrupted, it is called environmental pollution. Nowadays, almost everywhere, our environment is getting polluted. In many places of our country, the environment has become extremely polluted. We, ourselves, are responsible for this situation. Industries and factories emit huge amount of smoke, gases and fume. Motor vehicles also emit large amount of smoke and gases. All these cause air pollution. Water is polluted from the dumping of industrial wastes and by chemical fertilizers and insecticides. Sound pollution occurs due to the indiscriminate use of vehicle horns, loud speakers, microphones, etc. Soil is polluted by harmful chemical fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides. Trees play an important role in conserving the environment. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. Thus, they save the environment. But trees are being cut down for different commercial purposes. This needs to be stopped for the sake of keeping our environment healthy. Environment pollution is a great threat to our existence. It changes the world's climate and brings about different kinds of natural disasters. Thus, the world is getting unsuitable for living. To make life healthy and comfortable, we should keep the environment clean and pollution free."

          "explanation": "Duties of a Student\n\nThe period of life, which we spend to receive education in educational institutions is called student life. It is the most important and valuable period in one's life. This is the time, when the seeds of future life are sown. For this, it is called the sowing season of our life. During this period, a student has to do certain things to be successful in life.\nThe first and foremost duty of a student is to study hard. However, he must not confine himself to the prescribed books only. He must read newspaper, magazines, novels, dramas, etc. during his leisure. This will widen his mental horizon and enable him to be acquainted with the affairs of the world. Moreover, he should follow some rules and regulations. He should not waste his valuable time. He should be regular and punctual in his classes. He should take part in all types of extra-curricular activities such as singing, dancing, reciting, debating, painting, scouting, etc.\nA student should bear in mind that character is the crown of a man. So, he has to cultivate good manners and other noble virtues. He must not keep bad company. He should abstain from any type of bad, habits. All moral qualities like honesty, modesty, truthfulness, discipline, perseverance, sincerity, punctuality must be acquired during this period. He must be respectful to his parents, teachers and other superiors. He has to render helping hands to the helpless. He should be polite to all and rude to none. 'Simple living and high thinking' must be the motto of his life.\nMoreover, students should also render some duties and responsibilities to the society. They can teach the illiterate people about family planning, health, nutrition, child rearing, scientific method of cultivation etc. During natural calamities, students should come forward to help the affected people. They should collect food, clothes, medicine etc. and distribute them among the affected people.\nIn addition to these, a student has to be careful of his health as a sound mind lies in a sound body. Good health is the key to success. So, he should take physical exercise regularly and take part in various games and sports. Besides, he should always keep himself neat and clean.\nStudent life paves the way for one's future. So, every student should utilise this period of life in order to do something great in future.\n"
