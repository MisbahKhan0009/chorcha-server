In order to keep pace with the present world, we should have a good command over English. For maintaining communication with foreign countries and international organizations, we should learn English. Moreover, in order to have an access to the latest knowledge, research of the world, we need to learn English. Most of the records, documents and particulars are written in English. All the journals, magazines, articles and papers are also written in English. Besides, for the sake of higher education, we should learn it. Again, we should learn English because it can ensure our future career. People having a good command over English are highly valued in the job market. However, learning English is not an easy task. One should learn the grammatical rules very carefully. Without learning grammar, it is not possible to have a good command oyer English. Our present English textbook which is based on the communicative purposes, is very helpful for learning English. It introduces us-with the communicative functions of English and helps us use it in practical situations."
