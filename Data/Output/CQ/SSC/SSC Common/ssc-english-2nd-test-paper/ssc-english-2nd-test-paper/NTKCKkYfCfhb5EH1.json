It is the most important and valuable period in one's life. This is the time, when the seeds of future life are sown. For this, it is called the sowing season of our life. During this period, a student has to do certain things to be successful in life.\nThe first and foremost duty of a student is to study hard. However, he must not confine himself to the prescribed books only. He must read newspaper, magazines, novels, dramas, etc. during his leisure. This will widen his mental horizon and enable him to be acquainted with the affairs of the world. Moreover, he should follow some rules and regulations. He should not waste his valuable time. He should be regular and punctual in his classes. He should take part in all types of extra-curricular activities such as singing, dancing, reciting, debating, painting, scouting, etc.\nA student should bear in mind that character is the crown of a man. So, he has to cultivate good manners and other noble virtues. He must not keep bad company. He should abstain from any type of bad, habits. All moral qualities like honesty, modesty, truthfulness, discipline, perseverance, sincerity, punctuality must be acquired during this period. He must be respectful to his parents, teachers and other superiors. He has to render helping hands to the helpless. He should be polite to all and rude to none. 'Simple living and high thinking' must be the motto of his life.\nMoreover, students should also render some duties and responsibilities to the society. They can teach the illiterate people about family planning, health, nutrition, child rearing, scientific method of cultivation etc. During natural calamities, students should come forward to help the affected people. They should collect food, clothes, medicine etc. and distribute them among the affected people.\nIn addition to these, a student has to be careful of his health as a sound mind lies in a sound body. Good health is the key to success. So, he should take physical exercise regularly and take part in various games and sports. Besides, he should always keep himself neat and clean.\nStudent life paves the way for one's future. So, every student should utilise this period of life in order to do something great in future.\n"
