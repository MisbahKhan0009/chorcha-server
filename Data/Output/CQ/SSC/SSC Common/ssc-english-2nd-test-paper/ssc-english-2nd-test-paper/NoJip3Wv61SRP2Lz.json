          "explanation": "Traffic Jam\n\nTraffic jam is a situation in which a long line of vehicles on a road have stopped moving or are moving very slowly. Nowadays, traffic jam is a common problem in our towns and cities. It causes great sufferings to the passengers and the passers-by. The increasing number of vehicles mostly causes traffic jam. Day by day, the number of vehicles is increasing to meet the needs of the increased population. But the roads are not 'increasing in that proportion. Many vehicles moving on the same road at a time cause traffic jam. Many drivers do not abide by traffic rules. Besides, the traffic police are not sincere. The tendency of the bus drivers and conductors to get more passengers also causes traffic jam. Some drivers stop buses here and there and board and unboard passengers. This hampers the movement of other vehicles and causes traffic jam. The unlimited number of rickshaws plying on the streets is another cause of traffic jam. The general people have to face untold sufferings. They reach late at their working places. Students, employees, businessmen, workers all suffer tremendously for this. It occurs mostly during office and school or college time. During traffic jam, we feel extremely bored as it kills our valuable time. To relieve the passengers of the sufferings of traffic jam, some steps should be taken by the government. The drivers who do not abide by traffic rules should be punished: Traffic authority should be active to enforce the traffic rules and maintain the discipline on the roads."

          "explanation": "Wonders of Modern Science\n\nScience means knowledge gained through experiment and research. Science does many things for the development of human civilization. The modern age is a gift of science. We are passing our days under the great influence of science.\nWe see the influence of science at every step of our life. It has changed the way we live. It has invented many things for our comfort. Today we feel the presence of science in-our everyday life. The pen we write with, the shirt we put on, the bicycle we ride all are the invention of science. With the touch of a switch, we get our lights dazzling, fans whirling and radios and televisions singing and talking.\nThe invention of electricity has brought about а revolutionary change in the history of human civilization. Electricity helps to operate machine, factories and other heavy industries. Electric fans, lights, and heaters have made our life more enjoyable. Moreover,our agricultural and industrial development is fully dependent on modern science. We now cultivate our land with power tillers. The production of crops is increasing day by day with the help of chemical fertilizers and insecticides. Science also helps us in inventing new hybrid seeds. In industrial areas, science has made a significant contribution. From needles to rockets, everything produced in.industry is the contribution of science. Communication is considered the motion of life.\nScience has brought about a great change in our communication system also. Invention of speedy transports like bus, train, airplane, truck, ship etc. has made transportation faster and comfortable. Rocket and space shuttle are great wonders of modern science. By using them, man has already conquered the moon and is now preparing for the Mars. Besides, satellite television has added a new dimension to our communication system. It has brought the whole world to our living rоom. Moreover, telephone, FAX, E-mail, cellular phone, and internet have turned the whole world into a global village. We can instantly communicate with our friends and family through them.\nIn the medical field, science has done unbelievable improvements. Blood transfusion and transplantation of other organs have become possible with the help of science. The invention of X-ray, ECG, Ultrasonography, penicillin, CT scan, biopsy, various life-saving antibiotic, etc. has worked wonders in the field of medical science. Modern medical science has given eyes to the blind, hearing to the deaf, legs to the lame and what not.\nHowever, the inventions of science could also be destructive also if they are misused. By inventing atom bomb, hydrogen bomb, missiles, and other explosives, men are now destroying the human race and its beautiful creation in the world. The destruction caused by dropping atom bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II bears testimony to it.\nIn conclusion, the wonders of science cannot be described in words. But if it is misused, it brings destruction. So, it should be utilized for the greater benefit of human beings."
