          "explanation": "Dengue Fever/How to fight against it and face it\n\nDengue is a painful, debilitating mosquito-borne disease, bome by Aedes mosquito. Tropical areas, like Indian Subcontinent, Southeast Asia, Southern China, Taiwan, the Pacific Islands, 3 { }^{3} 3 the Caribbean, Mexico, Africa, Central and South America are the most vulnerable areas of the world where Dengue Fever is likely to occur. Symptoms of Dengue usually begin four to six days after infection and last up to ten days. Symptoms may include sudden high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, severe joint and muscle pain, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, skin rash and mild bleeding. These symptoms may progress to massive bleeding, shock, and death. People with weakened immune systems are believed to be at greater risk for developing Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever. A person with Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever may experience damage to lymph and blood vessels; internal bleeding which can lead to black vomit and feces; a lower number of platelets in the blood; sensitive stomach and weak pulse. Surprisingly, till today, there is no specific treatment, for dengue infection. Doctors generally suggest the infected people to take rest and drink plenty of fluids. If the situation worsens, the patient must be hospitalized. One of the effective ways to prevent Dengue Fever is to prevent bites by infected mosquitoes. We should keep in mind that currently there is no vaccine to prevent the disease for the general population from contracting it. The best way to lessen the risk of Dengue infection is to reduce the production of Aedes mosquito. We can do that by taking effective measures such as keeping our living places and neighborhoods clean, However, it is interesting to know that Aedes mosquito requires just one teaspoon of water to lay its eggs and for the laryae to fully develop into an adult mosquito. So, it can practically breed in any place where clean standing water is available. So, we must also remove clogged and accumulated -water so that Aedes mosquitoes cannot breed."

They have brought almost the whole world into our living room. Satellite TV is such an invention of modern science. It is a very effective medium of recreation. The programmes shown by various channels are very attractive. Desire to know the unknown and to see the unseen is really fulfilled by the satellite TV channels. Channels of foreign countries help us to know the culture, tradition, etc. of those countries. Through satellite channels, we can get the current news of the world. Some channels telecast up-to-date news of the world, and through documentary channels, we can learn numerous things.\n\nBut sometimes, some channels telecast programmes which affect the viewers, specially our young generation, very adversely. Because of the influence of satellite TV channels, youths of our country are gradually being exposed to western values and modes of life. They are blindly following those. Forgetting - their own culture, they are adopting the foreign culture. This is really a threat to our own culture and tradition. Sometimes, they get so addicted to these channels that they spend more time in watching TV and neglect their studies. Consequently, they become lazy and good-fornothing. T"
