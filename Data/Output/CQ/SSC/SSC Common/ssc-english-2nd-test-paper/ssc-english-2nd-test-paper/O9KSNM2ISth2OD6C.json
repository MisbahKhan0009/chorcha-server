          "explanation": "A Street Hawker\n\nA street hawker sells various things roaming from place to place. He is a common figure on, our street. Generally, he sells, various items like toys, clothes, fruits, utensils, vegetables, ice-cream, and so on. He carries his goods on his head or shoulder and sometimes, in a small handcart. He walks along roads and streets from dawn to dusk. He shouts the names of the items he sells. There are other types of hawkers also. They sell nothing but buy things like empty bottles, old newspapers, magazines, books, plastic and tin containers, broken household items, etc. A street hawker is very cunning. He knows his business very well. His main customers are children and women. So, he usually comes when his customers are free from their usual work and the male persons are not at home. He generally buys his goods at a cheaper rate and sells them at a profit. In fact, their goods are cheaper than those sold in the market. But sometimes, they supply spurious and sub-standard things and cheat the customers. Yet, the service that a street hawker renders to our society is really great. He brings the goods we need daily before our house. When we cannot go out to buy our necessaries, he brings them to our doorstep. However, a street hawker leads a very simple life. He lives from hand to month. But, he is a man of dignity because he earns his bread through hard work. So, we should respect his honest labour."
