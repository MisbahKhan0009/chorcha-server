          "explanation": "Uses and Abuses of Mobile Phone\nMobile phone is one of the latest inventions of modern science. It is a small cellular phone that can be easily carried with us. It has made our everyday life easy-going and tension free. We can now communicate eașily with others through this. As the networks of different mobile operators have covered almost the whole country, we do not have any chance to get lost. Our friends and family members can easily find us no matter how far we stay. Moreover, we can use Internet through mobile phone and communicate with others, very easily. Nowadays, it is also used as the alternative to computers because there are many kinds of apps in the latest mobile phones, which perform different types of work like, sending and receiving e-mail, using social networks, writing and editing documents, capturing photos, etc. Because of its great benefits, the number of mobile phone users is increasing day by day. But every positive thing has some negatives aspects as well. Mobile phone is also not an exception to this. Teenagers often spoil their valuable time by talking to their friends for a long time. They are often found to talk to thejr friends for long two or three hours at night. Different mobile operators often offer some mid-night free or low cost calls. Students mostly take this advantage and thus kill their time. Besides, hijackers, robbers and different anti-social activists ofteri commit crime by communicating among themselves through mobile phone. Scientists are warning that excessive use of mobile phone can cause brain cancer and hamper the mental growth of children. But despite these disadvantages, we use mobile phone as it has been a part and parcel in our daily life."

          "explanation": "Duties of a Student\nStudent life is the most useful and valuable period in a man's life. This is the time when the seeds of future life are sown. For this, it is called the sowing season in our life. During this period, a student has to do certain things to be successful and'happy in his future life. The principal duty of a student is to study and acquire knowledge on various things. He must study according to a routine. He has to be attentive to his studies and teachers. He should also read newspapers, magazines, literature, history, etc.\nA student should remember that character is the crown of a man: Therefore, he has to cultivate good manners and other noble virtues. All moral qualities like honesty, modesty, truthfulness, discipline, perseverance, sincerity, punctuality must be acquired during this time.\nHe should also render some services to his society and country. He should make the illiterate literate. He can make the farmers aware of the modern methods of cultivation. In population control, he can play an' important role.\nA student must obey and honour his parents. When they are sick, helpless or old, he must serve them. He should-also be obedient to his teachers and other superiors.\nA student must not waste his time and energy. So, he must possess a sound health by taking regular physical exercise, taking part in games and sports. Moreover, he must always avoid evil company.\nBesides, a student may have the knowledge of politics but he must not take part in active politics. It is because many political parties and their unethical leaders use them only for their selfish interest.\nIn case of national emergencies like floods, tornadoes, storms, etc. he must not sit idle. He must extend his helping hands during these crucial times.\nTo reap the good and expected harvest of success in future, a student must sow good seeds during his student life. Otherwise it will bring him utter failure, untold sorrows, miseries and repentance.\n"
