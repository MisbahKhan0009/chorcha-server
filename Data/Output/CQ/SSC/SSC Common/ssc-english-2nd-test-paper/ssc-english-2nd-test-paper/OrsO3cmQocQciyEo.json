          "explanation": "A Street Hawker\n\nA street hawker sells various things roaming from place to place. He is a common figure on our street. Generally, he sells various items like toys, clothes, fruits, utensils, vegetables; ice-cream, and so on. He carries his goods on his head or shoulder and sometimes, in a small handcart. He walks along roads and streets from dawn to dusk. He shouts the names of the items he sells. There are other types of hawkers also. They sell nothing but buy things like empty bottles, old newspapers, magazines, books, plastic and tin containers, broken household items, etc. A street hawker is very cunning. He knows his business very well. His main customers are children and women. So, he usually comes when his customers are free from their usual work and the male persons are not at home. He generally buys his goods at a cheaper rate and sells them at a profit. In fact, their goods are cheaper than those sold in the market. But sometimes, they supply spurious and sub-standard things and cheat the customers. Yet, the service that a street hawker renders to our society is really great. He brings the goods we need daily before our house. When we cannot go out to buy our necessaries, he brings them to our doorstep. However, a street hawker leads a very simple life. He lives from hand to month. But, he is a man of dignity because he earns his bread through hard work. So, we should respect his honėst labour."

Many schools in our locality have already started computer courses for their. students. Computers are very important in modern life. They help students to learn new things, prepare assignments, and gain knowledge about the world. Without computer education, students may fall behind compared to students from other schools. Introducing a computer course in our school will help us learn basic computer skills, type documents, use the internet safely, and prepare for future jobs. Many students of our school are interested in learning computers, but we do not have the opportunity yet. We hopе that you will consider this request and take necessary steps to start a computer course soon.\nWe, therefore, hope that you would be kind enough to consider the matter and introduce a computer course in the school and oblige thereby.\n\nYours obediently,\nShahzadi Binte Ameen\nClass: X\nSonapur High School, Barishal"

We remember those for long. My first day at secondary school is a memorable event in my life. I remember the day most.\nThat day I went to school very simply. But I put on a new dress and shoes. I got a hew school bag. I also took new books and pens. The day was very interesting to me because I felt much pleasure to get education again after finishing the examination of Class V. It was my new school. I set out for school taking wishes from my parents.\nI met many old classmates and many new faces there. I made several new friends, too. We exchanged greetings with one another who were familiar. We also introduced ourselves to the new classmates. We talked about various aspects of our school life. We also took down the routine from the notice board. That day I came to know some new ideas of learning. Those were quite different from primary education.\nIn the morning session we were invited to the hall-room. There the Headmaster addressed us. In his speech the Headmaster spoke of general rules and regulations of the school. He also spoke about basic norms and values. I entered the classroom along with other students joyfully. First the English teacher entered our classroom and he lectured on the importance of learning English. After him, Bangla teacher entered and lectured on Bangla. He cut jokes. It gave us pleasure.\nWe enjoyed ourselves during recess. I went to the common room with some of my friends and played some indoor games. After that, some of my friends and I went to the school canteen and took snacks aid cold drinks.\nMy-first day at secondary school was very joyous. It gave me much excitement. I felt thrilled because I could learn many things in the school Still I remember the day."
