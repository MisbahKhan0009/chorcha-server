          "explanation": "\nRoad Accidents in Bangladesh\n\nRoad accident refers to an accident involving at least one vehicle on a road open to public traffic in which at least one person is injured or killed. There has been an alarming rise in road accidents, significantly highway accidents, in Bangladesh over the past few years. According to a study conducted by the Accident Research Centre (ARC) of BUET, road dccidents claim on average 12,000 lives annually and lead to about 35,000 injuries. There are some obvious reasons for these road accidents which can be checked by taking some pragmatic actions. The reasons mostly responsible for these accidents include: unfit vehicles, unskilled drivers, reckless driving, overtaking tendency of the drivers, sudden break failure, overloading of vehicles, drivers' and passengers' negligence to follow traffic rules, damaged roads and oyer-works of the drivers during special occasions like Eids when there remains an unusual rush in the roads and highways. However, the government should monitor vehicles on roads and highways more strictly and enforce harsher punishments for traffic violations. Any form of reckless driving, driving over the speed limit, changing lanes without signaling, and other road offenses should be stopped immediately by enacting strict laws and imposing heavy fines. Even suspensions of the drivers' licenses, and even arrests, ought to be made for such actions. Strict punishments will discourage drivers from breaking traffic rules, creating a safer driving environment. A clear message must be sent to the public that there will be no compromise when it comes to road safety. This is how, we can minimize the road accidents in Bangladesh and save thousands of valuable lives.\n"

          "explanation": "Life of a Street Hawker\n\nA street hawker is a common figure we see in cities and towns. He walks around, carrying things on his head, shoulders, or in a small cart. A street hawker sells many items like fruits, vegetables, toys, clothes, and small things for the home. It is easy for people to buy from him because they don't have to go to a big market.\n\nA street hawker starts his day very early in the morning. He buys his goods from local markets or big sellers and tries to get good prices. Then, he goes to different streets, trying to sell his items. A street hawker has a special way of selling. He uses loud calls or shouts to get people's attention. Some hawkers even play small instruments to make people look at their items.\n\nA street hawker usually leads a poor life. While working, he often wears torn clothes. He lives with his family in a small hut or in a slum. Many street hawkers live alone in the city, leaving their families back in the village. This is because their income is too low to support their families in the city. They live from hand to mouth. They cannot afford proper food for their families or send their children to good schools. With the recent rise in prices of essential goods in our country, street hawkers and others in this class feel especially vulnerable and helpless. Being a street hawker is not easy. They work long hours and face problems like bad weather and low income. They also have competition with big shops and sometimes face problems with local authorities. Even with these challenges, street hawkers keep working because this is how they earn their living. Street hawkers add life and colour to our streets. They play an important role in our communities. We should respect their hard work and the service they provide.\n"
