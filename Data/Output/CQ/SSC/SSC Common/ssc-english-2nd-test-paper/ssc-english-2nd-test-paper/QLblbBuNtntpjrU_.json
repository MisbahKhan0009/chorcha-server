Some people take drugs to forget. their painful past or present. Some people take drugs as a pursuit of pleasure. Some people, at first, take drugs as a fun but afterwards it turns into an addiction. The effects of drug addiction are very harmful and serious. The health of the addicts breaks down. They lose their mental and physical strength.

          "explanation": "My Childhood Memories\nMan loves to turn back to his past and feel nostalgic. Childhood is an important part of human life as many events of both pleasure and pain take place during that period.\nTo me childhood is the sweetest period in a man's life. The 'memories of my childhood haunt (তাড়িত করে) me like a passion (ঘোর, মোহ) very often. Whenever I feel very lonely or dejected, I dive into the memories of my childhood, remove my loneliness and fill my heart with happiness. Then, I wish I could be a child again! The memories of my school days dominate my childhood. I was sent to school at six. I studied in a distant primary school named Kanchichora Government Primary school upto class two. Then I was made to take my admission in another school called Mathbari Government Primary School. I used to go to school with my village friends. My cousin who was one year senior to me was my constant school-going companion. In school the classes were not much interesting to me but the leisure period while we used to play various sports. I was a regular student in my class. So I was hardly beaten or scolded (বকাবকি করা) by my teachers for negligence to studies. After the school was over, in our way home, we used to-play ha-du-du, hide and seek, gather plums or steal' green mangoes-from some trees and sometimes used to bath in stream. One day I along with my three friends went to a friend's house to eat green-plum. But as thè tree was long, none of us dared to climb it up. Hence, we had to come back in a dissatisfied mind.\nIn my school I was not a good athlete. Yet I used to take part in various events. Once I got two prizes in race and long-jump and therefore became very excited and happy.\nThe holidays were favourite to me. On holidays I used to play with my friends almost the whole day. Sometimes I would go to some other village for play. I also would visit my nearby relatives on holidays. How happy I was in my childhood days! The happy and pleasant memories of those days still give me pleasure. If I could go back to those days again!"
