On behalf of the residents of [Your Locality], I would like to draw your urgent attention to the alarming spread of dengue in our area due to the uncontrolled mosquito population.\nThe stagnant water in drains, unclean surroundings, and lack of regular mosquito control measures have created an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes. As a result, a significant number of people in our locality are falling ill, especially from dengue, which poses a severe threat to public health. Children and the elderly are particularly vulnerable, and the situation is worsening by the day.\nWe kindly request the municipality to undertake immediate steps to address this pressing issue. Measures such as:\nRegular fogging with mosquito repellents.\nCleaning of drains and removal of stagnant water.\nAwareness campaigns to educate residents about preventive measures against dengue.\nInstallation of proper waste disposal systems.\nYour prompt action can prevent further outbreaks and ensure the well-being of the people in our locality. We trust your commitment to public service and hope for a quick resolution to this matter.\nThank you for your attention. We remain hopeful for your immediate intervention.\nSincerely, Sifat On Behalf of the Residents of [Your Locality] [Contact Information] [Date]"

          "question": "",
          "explanation": "Tree Plantation/ Importance of Trees in Our Life/Why More Trees Should Be Planted\nMen depend much on trees. Trees provide us with oxygen, food, furniture, etc. and take carbondioxide which is harmful to human beings and all animals. So to say, our life on earth largely depends upon trees. But it is a matter of great regret that we are cutting down trees very unwisely for some quick profit. It is really a matter of great concern .\nFirst, it is important to know what trees do for us. Man needs oxygen: In every breath we take oxygen in and leave carbon dioxide out. Trees leave oxygen out and take carbon dioxide in. Thus they provide us with the most necessary thing we need on earth. Trees also give us food and shelter . We cannot live without the help of trees.\nBut at present people are cutting down trees at a large scale. There are many reasons of cutting down trees. Man is cutting down them mainly for firewood and furniture. Every day our population is increasing. So, more firewood and furniture are needed for the additional people.\nTropical rain forests are also being cleared at a high rate. It takes thousands of years to grow a tropical rain forest. But, at present, they are being cleared at the rate of fourteen square miles per hour.\nOn the other hand, the effect of deforestation is very harmful and dangerous. For this, 'Greenhouse Effect' has occurred and the temperature of the world is increasing day by day. Heat waves have grasped many countries. Besides, ice is melting in the South and North Poles. The level of water in the sea is increasing on. This may lead to worldwide flood. Measures should immediately be taken to prevent deforestation. So, we should plant five trees if we cut down one. We should also try our best to stop curting down trees and save the environment. Otherwise, our future will be very difficult and uninhabitable."

          "explanation": "The Duties of a Student\nStudent life is the most useful and valuable period in a man's life. This is the time when the seeds of future life are sown. For this, it is called the sowing season in our life. During this period, a student has to do certain things to be successful and happy in his future life. The principal duty of a student is to study and acquire knowledge on various things. He must study according to a routine. He has to be attentive to his studies and teachers. He should also read newspapers, magazines, literature, history, etc.\nA student should remember that character is the crown of a man: Therefore, he has to cultivate good manners and other noble virtues. All moral qualities like honesty, modesty, truthfulness, discipline, perseverance, sincerity, punctuality must be acquired during this time.\nHe should also render some services to his society and country. He should make the illiterate literate. He can make the farmers aware of the modern methods of cultivation. In population control, he can play an important role.\nA student must obey and honour his parents. When they are sick, helpless or old, he must serve them, He should-also be obedient to his teachers and other superiors.\nA student must not waste his time and energy. So, he must possess a sound health by taking regular physical exercise, taking part in games and sports. Moreover, he must always avoid evil company.\nBesides, a student may have the knowledge of politics but he must not take part in active politics. It is because many political parties and their unethical leaders use them only for their selfish interest.\nIn case of national emergencies like floods, tornadoes, storms, etc. he must not sit idle. He must extend his helping hands during these crucial times.\nTo reap the good and expected harvest of success in future, a student must sow good seeds during his student life. Otherwise it will bring him utter failure, untold sorrows, miseries and repentance."
