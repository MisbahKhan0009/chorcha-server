High School\nSreenagar, Munshiganj\n\nSubject: Application for controlling mosquitoes in the school premises\n\nSir\nWe, the students of your school, would like to draw your attention to the current situation of dengue fever in our country. Dengue and Chikungunya have already taken an upper hand and are spreading rapidly across the country. Every day, we see news of deaths caused by dengue, and many others are suffering from Chikungunya and other mosquito-borne diseases. The best way to prevent these diseases is to control the mosquito population. Unfortunately, there are many bushes around our school, and these bushes are the breeding places for mosquitoes. Besides, in our school compound, there are several spots where water gets accumulated whenever it rains. Since mosquitoes breed in stagnant water, this is a serious threat to us. We are at great risk of getting dengue.\nWe hope that you would be kind enough to consider the current situation and take necessary actions to undertake the mosquíto control program.\n\nSincerely yours,\nTaskin Ahmed\nClass-X, Roll-01\nOn behalf of the students of Sreenagar Govt. High School"

          "explanation": "Negative Impacts of Artificial Intelligence\nNow we live in the age of Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligente, also known as AI, is a moderri technology that can perform many tasks like humans. It is helpful in many ways, but it also has some negative impacts. One major problem is losing job. When machines and robots do the work, many people may lose their jobs. For example, factories may use robots instead of workers, and offices may use AI software instead of human employees. Another negative impact is lack of human thinking. If people depend too much on AI, they may stop using their own brains. Students may use AI to do homework, which can make them weak in learning. AI can also make mistakes. Sometimes it gives wrong information, and people who believe it blindly may face problems. AI also collects a lot of data from users. If this data is not protected, it can harm people's privacy. Hackers may misuse the information. AI can also create fake photos, videos, or news, which can confuse people and spread false information.\nIn some cases, AI-powered machines can cause accidents if they stop working suddenly. So, while AI is helpful, we must use it carefully. Humans should stay in control and make sure technology is used for good purposes only."

          "explanation": "Climate Change and Its Impacts on Bangladesh\nClimate change is the change in earth's climatic pattern. Increase of temperature and natural disasters are the result of climate change. Due to increasing concentrations of Greenhouse gases, our climate is expected to change even more in the coming decades. Our country is one ofthe most affected ones by climate change in the world. This climate change has a huge impact on our agriculture, infrastructure, and way of life. This is mainly because of the geographical location of our country, making it highly vulnerable to natural disasters. Bangladesh has a flat, low lying landscape, and lack of institutional setup. Climate change is becoming a crucial issue to us and to our government as well. More than 80% of the land is prone to flooding. About two-thirds of our population is engaged in agriculture; so climate change will affect the farmers immensely. This natural disaster brings floods, cyclones, storms, extreme temperature and drought into the country. Mostly, the northern regions of Bangladesh suffer due to extreme temperature problem. The World Bank warns Bangladesh of becoming the country worst hit by climate change by the year 2100. A WB report estimates that the sea level will rise by 3 feet. This will cause huge flooding, and the failing of crops in the country. This will cause poverty and inflation\nSo, it can be said that we are already paying the price of climate change. If we don't build consciousness and become aware, we will be in great danger in the near future."
