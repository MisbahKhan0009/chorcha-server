Healthy food is good for our body. It helps us grow, keeps our body strong, and protects us from diseases. Healthy food includes fruits, vegetables, milk, eggs, fish, meat, and nuts. These foods give vitamins, minerals, and&proteins that are necessary for our body. Children who eat healthy food can study well, play actively, and stay energetic. On the other hand, junk food is not good for our body. Junk food includes fast food like burgers, fries, chips, cakes, soft drinks, and sweets. Junk food has too much fat, sugar, and salt, If we eat it often, it can make us weak, fat, and sick. It can also harm our teeth and stomach. Children who eat too much junk food may feel tired and lazy. We should eat healthy food most of the time and avoid junk food. Many of us eat junk food on special occasions, like birthdays or parţies. Of course, we should not eat too much. It is true that healthy food and exercise together keep our body fit and active. Parents should teach children to choose healthy food and make them aware of the bad effects of junk food. In conclusion, healthy food makes us strong and smart, while junk food can make us weak and ill. So, we should eat more healthy food and avoid junk food to lead a happy and healthy life."

          "explanation": "Food Adulteration\nFood is essential for our life. We eat food to stay healthy, grow well, and have energy for work and study. But nowadays, food adulteration has become a big problem in Bangladesh and all over the world. Food adulteration means the act of intentionally lowering the quality or purity of food by adding, removing or substituting ingredients in a way that makes the food unsafe, impure and less valuable. Sometimes, sellers mix harmful chemicals, artificial colors, or other materials in food to increase profit. This is very dangerous for human health.\nCommon examples of food adulteration include mixing starch in milk, adding chemicals in sweets, adding artificial colors to fruits and vegetables, and mixing water in oil. Many people do this to make more money. Unfortunately, people often buy these foods without knowing the harmful effects of them. Eating adulterated food can cause many diseases such as stomach problems, food poisoning, kidney diseases, and even cancer. Particularly, children, old people, and patients are more affected by adulterated food.\nIt is the responsibility of both the government and conscious people to stop food adulteration. Government authorities should check shops and markets regularly and punish those who sell adulterated or harmful food. People should also be careful while buying food. They should buy fresh and natural food, read labels, and avoid artificial or cheap-looking products. We should also spread awareness about the bad effects of adulterated food among our family, friends, and neighbors. Healthy food is necessary for a strong body and a sharp mind. Only by avoiding adulterated food we can live a healthy life and protect ourselves from diseases. In conclusion, food adulteration is a serious problem as it is generally related to health issue of the nation. We must fight against it and eat pure, healthy, and natural food to stay strong, active, and healthy."
