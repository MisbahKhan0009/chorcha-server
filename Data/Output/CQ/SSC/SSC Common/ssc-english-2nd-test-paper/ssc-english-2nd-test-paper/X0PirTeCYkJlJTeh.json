However, when the sun rises, dew drops sparkle like pearls. Old people and children shiver in cold, Poor people gather straw and make fire to bask in the heat, Animals, too, are helpless. They hide themselvés in the corner of the house and try to save themselves from the biting cold outside. People get up late in the morning. Elderly people and children usually get up a bit late to evade cold of the early moming. Working people go out when the fog disappears and the sun seems brighter. People somettimes eat homemade cakes with 'date juice' and enjoy the warmth of the early sun while sitting outside their homes. Bangalees settled abroad, make it a poirit to return and spend the winter in Bangladesh. They find the winter here pleasant as the winter in any European country is tremendously. cold. A winter morning in Bangladesh is thus quite fascinating for them. My personal feeling about a winter morning is that it is a bane for the poor but a boon for the rich."

          "explanation": "My Future Plan of Life\nMan aims for his future. An aimless life is like a boat without a rudder (মাস্তুলবিহীন জাহাজ) that can never reach - (পৌছা) its goal (গন্তব্য). To succeed in life one should have a future plan (ভবিষ্যৎ পরিকল্পনা) fron. one's early life (শৈশবকাল). This is called an aim in life. Therefore, it can be said that one's aim is one's future plan for life.\nNow I am a student. I believe that this period is a unique opportunity (সুযোগ) to do something and to succeed in life.\nI have decided to be a teacher. I know it is a very hard task. But I want to develop my nation. A teacher can lead the nation to the highest stage of prosperity (উন্নতি) if he can properly teach the students with his ideals.\nI want to serve the nation through proper teaching. A good teacher lives in the mind of the people of a nation forever. Our nation is a poor one. Illiteracy is a vital cause of our poverty. It is the root of all of our obstacles (বাধা). If our students are properly educated, they can alleviate (দূর করা) our poverty. By being a teacher, I am determined (দৃঢ় সংকল্প) to serve the nation.\nIn order to fulfil my future plan, I must acquire some degrees. I sympathise (সহমর্মিতা) all students who fail in English. So, I want to be a teacher of English. After passing my HSC Examination, I will get myself admitted into Honour's in English. After completing my Honour's and Master's degrees, I shall join a college to teach the students with my best effort. I would like to choose a rural area as my working place.\nI would like to serve my country sincerely. The condition of English in our country is very poor. I would like to improve it. If our nation is capable enough to communicate (যোগাযোগ) internationally, she can easily reach her destination (গন্তব্য) to prosperity. Though English is a foreign language, we hardly can do anything without it in this age, I shall teach my students the four skills of language listening (শ্রবণ), speaking (বলা), reading (পড়া) and writing (লিখন) within the shortest possible time.\nI pray to Allah for the success of my future plan. I have been studying heart and soul to build up a strong background of English in me. Apart from the school texts, I regularly go through English newspapers, magazines, periodicals, journals, etc. to improve my stock of vocabulary. I hope I shall be able to translate my aim or future plan into reality by the grace of Allah."
