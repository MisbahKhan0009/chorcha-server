It can give us an opportunity to make everyone aware of the importance of planting trees. Moreover,, they will learn the severe impacts of cutting down trees indiscriminately. It is, no doubt, a noble programme in which the students will participate spontaneously. Such a move to maintain ecological balance is essential for the common benefits of humans and animals.\nTherefore, we would like to request you to grant our prayer and oblige us thereby.\n\nObediently yours,\nRaihan\nOn behalf of the students of\nDinajpur Zilla School"

          "explanation": "A Winter Morning\n\nA winter morning is cold and foggy. Everything seems hazy and indistinct. Grasses are wet with dew drops. However, when the sun rises, dew drops sparkle like pearls. Old people and children shiver in cold. Poor people gather straw and make fire to bask in the heat. Animals, too, are helpless. They hide themselves in the corner of the house and try to save themselves from the biting cold outside. People get up late in the morning. Elderly people and children usually get up a bit late to evade cold of the early morning. Working people go out when the fog disappears and the sun seems brighter. People sometimes eat homemade cakes with 'date juice' and enjoy the warnth of the early sun while sitting outside their homes. Bangalees settled abroad, make it a point to return and spend the winter in Bangladesh. They find the winter here pleasant as the winter in any European country is tremendously cold. A winter morning in Bangladesh is thus quite fascinating for them. My personal feeling about a winter morning is that it is a bane for the poor but a boon for the rich."

          "explanation": "Causes of Road Accidents in Bangladesh\n\nRoad accidents are one of the most serious problems in Bangladesh today. Every year, thousands of people are killed and many more are injured on roads in cities, towns, and villages. There are many causes behind these accidents. One of the main causes is careless and reckless driving. Many drivers drive very fast, overtake dangerously, and do not follow traffic rules. Some drivers talk on mobile phones, use headphones, or drive after taking drugs, which greatly increases the chance of accidents.\nBad condition of roads is another big cause. Many roads have holes, broken parts, narrow lanes, and no proper road markings. During the rainy season, roads become slippery and full of water, making travel very risky. Poor traffic management also causes many accidents. Traffic lights often do not work properly, and there are not enough traffic police at busy crossings. Many people ignore signals and break traffic laws.\nUntrained and unlicensed drivers are responsible for many deadly accidents. Some drivers learn driving in the wrong way and start driving heavy vehicles without proper skills. Overloading of buses, trucks, and three wheeler is another major cause. When too many people or goods are carried, drivers lose control easily.\nBattery-run rickshaws have become a new danger on the streets of Dhaka. Their number is increasing day by day. Many of these rickshaw drivers do not follow traffic rules, drive on main roads, move suddenly, and create traffic jams. They often cause accidents because they are not properly trained.\nCareless pedestrians also add to the problem by crossing roads without using foot over bridges or zebra crossings. Mechanical problems in old vehicles and lack of safety awareness also increase accidents.\nTo reduce road accidents, traffic rules must be strictly followed, roads repaired, drivers trained, and people made aware."
