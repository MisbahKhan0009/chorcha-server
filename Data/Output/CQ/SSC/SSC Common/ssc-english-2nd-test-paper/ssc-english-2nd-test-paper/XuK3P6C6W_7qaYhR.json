As the world is becoming increasingly interconnected, the importance of mastering various languages has never been greater. A language club would not only enhance our communication skills but also allow us to explore diverse cultures and broaden our horizons.\nThrough a language club, students could participate in activities such as language workshops, debates, quizzes, and cultural exchange programs. Such initiatives would help improve fluency in languages like English, Bangla, and even foreign languages such as French, German, or Chinese. Moreover, it would provide an opportunity to develop confidence in public speaking, presentation, and creative writing.\nWe believe that the presence of a language club would be an asset to our school. It could inspire students to engage in academic excellence while also building a bridge to global learning opportunities. We are confident that under your guidance, the language club will thrive and positively impact the academic environment of our school.\nTherefore, we kindly request you to consider our proposal and take the necessary steps to establish a language club. We are willing to offer our cooperation to make this initiative successful.\nThank you for your attention and understanding.\nYours sincerely, Samin Class Ten [Date]"

          "explanation": "Our National Flag\n\nA national flag is the symbol of independence and sovereignty of a country. Every free nation of the world has its own national flag. It introduces a country to the whole world. As a free nation, we also have a national flag of our own. We achieved this flag through a bloody war against the Pakistani military forces in 1971. The shape of our national flag is rectangular. The ratio of its length and width is 10 : 6 10: 6 10 : 6 . It is made of cotton, linen or silk. It bears a combination of two colours. The major part of it is deep green and there is a red circle in the middle of it. The radius of the circle is one-fifth of the length of the flag. Its deep green colour stands for everlasting youth, freshness and vigour of our nation. It also symbolises the greenery of Bangladesh. On the other hand, the red circle symbolises the rising sun of independence. It also stands for the supreme sacrifices of our heroic freedom fighters, who laid down their lives for the independence of our motherland. The flag is hoisted everyday on the top of government buildings, educational institutions and offices. Moreover, it is hoisted everywhere on the Independent Day and the Victory Day. Besides, it is kept half-mast on our national mourning days. Our national flag is the source of our spirit, hope, and aspiration. So, we must defend our independence at any cost and save the existence and prestige of our national flag."

          "explanation": "Duties of a Student\n\nThe period of life, which we spend to receive education in educational institutions is called student life. It is the most important and valuable period in one's life. This is the time, when the seeds of future life are sown. For this, it is called the sowing season of our life. During this period, a student has to do certain things to be successful in life.\nThe first and foremost duty of a student is to study hard. However, he must not confine himself to the prescribed books only. He must read newspaper, magazines, novels, dramas, etc. during his leisure. This will widen his mental horizon and enable him to be acquainted with the affairs of the world. Moreover, he should follow some rules and regulations. He should not waste his valuable time. He should be regular and punctual in his classes. He should take part in all types of extra-curricular activities such as singing, dancing, reciting, debating, painting, scouting, etc.\nA student should bear in mind that character is the crown of a man. So, he has to cultivate good manners and other noble virtues. He must not keep bad company. He should abstain from any type of bad, habits. All moral qualities like honesty, modesty, truthfulness, discipline, perseverance, sincerity, punctuality must be acquired during this period. He must be respectful to his parents, teachers and other superiors. He has to render helping hands to the helpless. He should be polite to all and rude to none. 'Simple living and high thinking' must be the motto of his life.\nMoreover, students should also render some duties and responsibilities to the society. They can teach the illiterate people about family planning, health, nutrition, child rearing, scientific method of cultivation etc. During natural calamities, students should come forward to help the affected people. They should collect food, clothes, medicine etc. and distribute them among the affected people.\nIn addition to these, a student has to be careful of his health as a sound mind lies in a sound body. Good health is the key to success. So, he should take physical exercise regularly and take part in various games and sports. Besides, he should always keep himself neat and clean.\nStudent life paves the way for one's future. So, every student should utilise this period of life in order to do something great in future.\n"
