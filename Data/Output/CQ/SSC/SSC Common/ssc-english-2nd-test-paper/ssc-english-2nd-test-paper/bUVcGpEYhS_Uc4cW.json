As the world is becoming increasingly interconnected, the importance of mastering various languages has never been greater. A language club would not only enhance our communication skills but also allow us to explore diverse cultures and broaden our horizons.\nThrough a language club, students could participate in activities such as language workshops, debates, quizzes, and cultural exchange programs. Such initiatives would help improve fluency in languages like English, Bangla, and even foreign languages such as French, German, or Chinese. Moreover, it would provide an opportunity to develop confidence in public speaking, presentation, and creative writing.\nWe believe that the presence of a language club would be an asset to our school. It could inspire students to engage in academic excellence while also building a bridge to global learning opportunities. We are confident that under your guidance, the language club will thrive and positively impact the academic environment of our school.\nTherefore, we kindly request you to consider our proposal and take the necessary steps to establish a language club. We are willing to offer our cooperation to make this initiative successful.\nThank you for your attention and understanding.\nYours sincerely, Samin Class Ten [Date]"

          "explanation": "Our National Flag\n\nA national flag is the symbol of independence and sovereignty of a country. Every free nation of the world has its own national flag. It introduces a country to the whole world. As a free nation, we also have a national flag of our own. We achieved this flag through a bloody war against the Pakistani military forces in 1971. The shape of our national flag is rectangular. The ratio of its length and width is 10 : 6 10: 6 10 : 6 . It is made of cotton, linen or silk. It bears a combination of two colours. The major part of it is deep green and there is a red circle in the middle of it. The radius of the circle is one-fifth of the length of the flag. Its deep green colour stands for everlasting youth, freshness and vigour of our nation. It also symbolises the greenery of Bangladesh. On the other hand, the red circle symbolises the rising sun of independence. It also stands for the supreme sacrifices of our heroic freedom fighters, who laid down their lives for the independence of our motherland. The flag is hoisted everyday on the top of government buildings, educational institutions and offices. Moreover, it is hoisted everywhere on the Independent Day and the Victory Day. Besides, it is kept half-mast on our national mourning days. Our national flag is the source of our spirit, hope, and aspiration. So, we must defend our independence at any cost and save the existence and prestige of our national flag."

          "explanation": "My Childhood Memories\nMan loves to turn back to his past and feel nostalgic. Childhood is an important part of human life as many events of both pleasure and pain take place during that period.\nTo me childhood is the sweetest period in a man's life. The memories of my childhood haunt (তাড়িত করে) me like a passion (ঘোর, মোহ) very often. Whenever I feel very lonely or dejected, I dive into the memories of my childhood, remove my loneliness and fill my heart with happiness. Then, I wish I could be a child again!\nThe memories of my school days dominate my childhood. I was sent to school at six. I studied in. a distant primary school named Kanchichora Government Primary school upto class two. Then I was made to take my admission in another school called Mathbari Government Primary School. I used to go to school with my village friends. My cousin who was one year senior to me was my constant school-going companion. In school the classes were not much interesting to me but the leisure period while we used to play various sports. I was a regular student in my class. So I was hardly beaten or scolded (বকাবকি করা) by my teachers for negligence to studies. After the school was over, in our way home, we used to play ha-du-du, hide and seek, gather plums or steal green mangoes from some trees and sometimes used to bath in stream.\nOne day I along with my three friends went to a friend's house to eat green-plum. But as the tree was long, none of us dared to climb it up. Hence, we had to come back in a dissatisfied mind.\nIn my school I was not a good athlete. Yet I used to take part in various events. Once I got two prizes in race and long-jump and therefore became very excited and happy.\nThe holidays were favourite to me. On holidays I used to play with my friends almost the whole day. Sometimes I would go to some other village for play. I also would visit my nearby relatives on holidays.\nHow happy I was in my childhood days! The happy and pleasant memories of those days still give me pleasure. If I could go back to those days again!"
