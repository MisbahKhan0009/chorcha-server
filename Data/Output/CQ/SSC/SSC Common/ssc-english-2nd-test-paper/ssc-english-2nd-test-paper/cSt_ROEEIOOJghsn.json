However, it is sad to say that the lab can no longer provide the services: The number of computers in the lab were already insufficient compared to the number of users. And now, most of them are out of order. Consequently, the students cannot get proper facilities for practice.\nWe, therefore, hope that you would be kind enough to take prompt steps to repair the computers or buy new ones and oblige us thereby.\n\nYours sincerely,\nMita Islam\nRoll-02, Class X\nOn.behalf of the students of\nJoypara High School"
