          "explanation": "Climate Change and Its Impacts on Bangladesh\nClimate change is the change in earth's climatic pattern. Increase of temperature and natural disasters are the result of climate change. Due to increasing concentrations of Greenhouse gases, our climate is expected to change even more in the coming decades. Our country is one ofthe most affected ones by climate change in the world. This climate change has a huge impact on our agriculture, infrastructure, and way of life. This is mainly because of the geographical location of our country, making it highly vulnerable to natural disasters. Bangladesh has a flat, low lying landscape, and lack of institutional setup. Climate change is becoming a crucial issue to us and to our government as well. More than 80% of the land is prone to flooding. About two-thirds of our population is engaged in agriculture; so climate change will affect the farmers immensely. This natural disaster brings floods, cyclones, storms, extreme temperature and drought into the country. Mostly, the northern regions of Bangladesh suffer due to extreme temperature problem.\nThe World Bank warns Bangladesh of becoming the country worst hit by climate change by the year 2100. A WB report estimates that the sea level will rise by 3 feet. This will cause huge flooding, and the failing of crops in the country. This will cause poverty and inflation\nSo, it can be said that we are already paying the price of climate change. If we don't build consciousness and become aware, we will be in great danger in the near future."
