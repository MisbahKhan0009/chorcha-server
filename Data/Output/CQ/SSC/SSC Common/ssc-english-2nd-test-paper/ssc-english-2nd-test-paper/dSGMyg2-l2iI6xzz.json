          "explanation": "Career Planning\n\nCareer planning is the process of setting career goals preparing step by step to reach that goal. It is an important part of every student's life because a good career helps us earn money, live safely, and support our families. That is why students should start planning early. First, we need to understand our interests. Some students like science, some enjoy arts, and others prefer business or technical skills. Choosing a career that matches our interest makes work enjoyable. After selecting a goal, we must work hard to achieve it. Career planning also means learning new skills. In today's world, computer skills, English speaking, and problem-solving abilities are very important for many jobs. Parents, teachers, and career counsellors can guide us and help us understand our strengths and weaknesses. We should also learn about job opportunities in Bangladesh, such as government jobs, freelancing, banking, agriculture, and business. Good career planning gives us direction, confidence, and hope. It helps us build a bright and successful future. Good career planning helps us stay focused and confident. It gives us a clear direction and helps us build a bright future."

I want you to know that you are not alone. I am always here for you, and you are strong enough to handle this.\nFirst, remember that bullying is never your fault. People who bully others usually feel weak inside. Do not believe their hurtful words. You are a kind, smart, and brave girl.When someone bullies you, try not to react with anger. Stay calm and walk away. Bullies enjoy seeing you upset. If you ignore them, they will stop it. But do not keep everything inside. Inform your class teacher of it. He/she can help you and make sure you are safe. Also, share everything with Ma or Baba. Talking to family makes the problem easier. Stay close to good friends who support you. Always remember that you are loved, valued, and very special.\nTake care and stay safe.\n\nWith love,\nTamanna apu"

          "explanation": "Season Shifting in Bangladesh\n\nBangladesh is a country known for its distinct seasonal changes, which greatly affect the lives of its people, agriculture and natural environment. Normally, season shifting means changes in the normal pattern of seasons. Traditionally, Bangladesh is a country of six beautiful seasons-summer, rainy season, autumn, late autumn, winter, and spring. In the past, people could clearly feel each season. Every season had its own weather, taste, colour, and beauty. But today, the seasons are not coming at the right time, and their duration is also changing day by ay. This problem is called season shifting.\nThe main reason for season shifting is climate change. Global warming is making the Earth hotter. As a result, Bangladesh is also facing unusual weather. Summer is becoming longer and hotter than before. The rainy season is often late, and sometimes it rains too much at once, causing floods. In some years, rain becomes very little, and farmers suffer a lot because their crops do not grow well.\nWinter is also getting shorter and warmer. In the past, the northern districts of Bangladesh felt very cold, but now the temperature does not fall as much. Spring, which is known as the king of seasons, is becoming very short. Many people say that spring almost disappears because it passes too quickly. Sudden storms and heatwaves are also becoming common.\nSeason shifting affects our agriculture, health, and daily life. Farmers cannot plan their planting time properly. People suffer from heat-related illnesses. Mosquito-borne diseases like dengue increase when weather changes suddenly. People also face problems with water supply, electricity, and transport.\nTo reduce season shifting, we must protect our environment. Planting more trees, saving water, reducing pollution, and using clean energy can help. Everyone-students, parents, teachers, and the gövernment-must work together. No doubt, season shifting is a warning for us. If we take proper care of nature today, we can save the beautiful seasons of Bangladesh for our future generations."
