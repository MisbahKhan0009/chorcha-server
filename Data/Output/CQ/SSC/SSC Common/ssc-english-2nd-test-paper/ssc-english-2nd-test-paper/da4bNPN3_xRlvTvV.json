As you are aware, the common room is a vital space for students to refresh their minds and engage in recreational activities during breaks. However, the current setup is insufficient to meet the increasing needs of the students.\nThe common room lacks adequate seating arrangements, indoor game facilities, and updated newspapers and magazines. During recess, it becomes overcrowded, leaving many students without the opportunity to utilize the space effectively. This has a negative impact on our relaxation time, which is essential for maintaining focus and productivity in classes.\nWe humbly request your kind intervention to enhance the facilities in the common room by providing more chairs and tables, introducing additional indoor games like carrom and chess, and ensuring a regular supply of updated reading materials. These improvements would greatly contribute to the overall well-being and academic performance of the students.\nWe are hopeful for your understanding and prompt action in this regard.\nThank you for considering our request.\nYours faithfully,\nSumona Akter On behalf of the students Khulna Zilla School"

A school library is only for the teachers and the students of a school. We have an up-to-date library in our school. It is housed in a separate one-storey building. It is quite spacious and well-ventilated. The books are arranged systemically in different bookshelves. So, we have no difficulty in finding out the expected books. Our school library has a good collection of text and reference books. It has also books on different branches of knowledge like literature, history, science, commerce, geography, travels, biography and so on. Besides, it has a good supply of newspapers, magazines and journals. Moreover, there is a librarian in charge of our school library. He is well-trained, qualified and experienced. Every student has a library card. We can borrow two books at a time. Nobody is allowed to keep a book for more than two weeks. In the library, discipline and silence is strictly maintained. While studying in the reading room, students are strictly prohibited to talk or disturb others in any way. The calm and quiet atmosphere of the library helps the students to work attentively. Our school library plays an important role in enriching both our academic and general knowledge. It provides us with the opportunity to read different types of books. To us, it is a storehouse of knowledge. I think, every educational institution should have a library. To conclude it can be said that no educational institute is a complete one without a library."

          "explanation": "The Game (Or, Sport) I Like Most [The Game of Football]\nA game is a form of competitive activity or sport played according to rules. Games are played primarily for amusement and enjoyment, but they may be also taken as exercise. Everyone in this world may have his/her own favorite game. Like others, I have also a favourite game and it is football. I often play it with my friends in the evening. I like this game very much.\nI like football for many reasons. We do not require costly equipment for this game. A ball and a well leveled ground are all that is required to start the game. It thrills not only the players but also the spectators. Throughout the game, the spectators bubble with excitement.. This is the only game, which is so much exciting from the beginning to the end. No other game can give me so much pleasure as football.\nA rectangular grassy ground is more suitable for playing football. The longer sides are called touchlinesand the opposite sides are called goal lines. The goal lines should be 45 to 90 metres and the touchlines should be 90 to 120 metres in lenth. There are two goal posts at each of the two opposite ends of the ground. A bar is tied eight feet above the ground to the goal posts. There are also centre and penalty box. The corners of ground are marked by corner flags.\nThe game is played between two teams. Each team consists of eleven players. There are a goal keeper, two backs, three half backs and five forwards on each side. The goal keeper and the two backs play on the defense while the five others lead the attack towards the opposite goal-post. The half backs play on the defense and lead the attack also. The forwards try to kick the ball into the goal-post of the opposite team, while the backs and the goalkeeper try to prevent them from scoring. A goal is scored when the ball crosses the goal line in the goal-post. While playing, no player except the goalkeeper can touch the ball with hands. A referee along with two linesmen conducts the game. Each player is bound to abide by the decision of the referee. The duration of the game is 90 minutes. It is divided into two equal halves with an interval of 10 to 15 minutes. At the end of the first half, each team changes its side. The team which scores more goals wins the match.\nHowever, football is a game of great excitement and enjoyment. It is a form of exercise also. It makes the players prompt, cautious, strong, healthy, energetic and active. It also teaches many moral qualities like obedience, cooperation, discipline, tolerance, etc.\nHowever, football has some demerits too. The players often get injured. Sometimes, the game leads to bitter quarrel not only between the players in the field but also between the supporters in the gallery. Moreover, for a student like me, too much interest in the game often hampers his or her studies.\nDespite the little demerits, I like to play football most. It keeps me physically and mentally sound. It also teaches me obedience, discipline, teamwork and leadership as well."
