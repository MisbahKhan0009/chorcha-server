Many young people are seen to get involved in harmful activities such as theft, vandalism, eve-teasing and disturbing public peace. This makes the neighborhood unsafe, especially for females, children and elderly residents. I believe that with proper guidance and strict measures, these teenagers can be stopped from going down the wrong path. Necessary actions, such as organizing awareness programs, increasing security, and setting up youth clubs to keep teenagers engaged in positive activities can be solution to this problem. I hope, you would be kind enough to take remedial measures at the earliest and oblige thereby.\n\nYours obediently\n\nDr. Kazi Arafat Hossain\n\nTajmahal Road, Mohammadpur\n"

          "explanation": "The Bad Impacts of Deforestation\nDeforestation, the large-scale clearing of forests, has numerous detrimental impacts on the environment, biodiversity, and human societies. One of the most significant consequences is the loss of biodiversity, as forests are home to countless species of plants, animals, and microorganisms. When forests are destroyed, these species lose their habitats, leading to extinction or displacement, which disrupts ecosystems and food chains. Moreover, deforestation contributes significantly to climate change. Trees absorb carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, and release oxygen, helping to regulate the Earth's temperature. When forests are cut down, not only is this carbon-absorbing capacity lost, but the stored carbon in trees is also released back into the atmosphere, exacerbating global warming. Soil erosion and degradation are other serious outcomes of deforestation, as tree roots bind the soil and prevent it from being washed away by rain. Without this natural protection, lands become barren and unproductive, which can severely impact agriculture and water quality. Additionally, deforestation disrupts the water cycle by reducing the amount of water vapor released into the atmosphere through transpiration, leading to changes in rainfall patterns and increased risks of drought. Human communities, particularly indigenous populations that rely on forests for their livelihoods, culture, and traditions, also suffer immensely from deforestation. The loss of forests can lead to food and water scarcity, increased poverty, and displacement. Collectively, these consequences underline the urgent need for sustainable practices and reforestation efforts to mitigate the devastating impacts of deforestation."

          "explanation": "\n\nStudents and Social Services Or, Service Rendered by the Students to Build up Our Nation\n\nStudents are the future leaders and makers of a nation. They are the devotees in the temple of learning. So, the most important duty of students is to study seriously with devotion. It does not mean that they are isolated from the-society. They are also social beings like other classes of people. They enjoy the same social benefits, rights and privileges. So, as members of society, they have certain duties to the society in which they live in. There are many kinds of social services and students have a lot to do in these sectors.\n\nLiving in a developing country like ours, students must render some social services for the development and welfare of the nation. So during the long vacation and leisure time, students can open night schools and teach the illiterate working children and adult people. They can also teach the farmers about the modern methods of cultivation, the use of fertilizers and proper caring of crops. They can also suggest them to dig a pond for fish cultivation or to make a farm. .\n\nStudents can render immense service in the field of health. The village people and the people living in the slums have. no knowledge about health, nutrition and sanitation. The students can teach them about the basic rules of health, nutrition and sanitation. Female? students can also teach the uneducated women how to keep their houses neat and clean, how to bring up children and look after their health.\n\nStudents can prove themselves to be worthy citizens during natural disasters. In times of flood, famine and cyclone, earthquake and epidemic, they can come forward to help the affected people. They can collect money from the rich, rescue the affected, feed the hungry, nurse the sick and clothe the unclothed. During epidemics, medical students can serve the sick with food, clothes and medicine.\n"
