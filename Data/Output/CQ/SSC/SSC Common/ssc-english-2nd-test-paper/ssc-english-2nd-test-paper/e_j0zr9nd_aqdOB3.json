As you are aware, the common room is a vital space for students to refresh their minds and engage in recreational activities during breaks. However, the current setup is insufficient to meet the increasing needs of the students.\nThe common room lacks adequate seating arrangements, indoor game facilities, and updated newspapers and magazines. During recess, it becomes overcrowded, leaving many students without the opportunity to utilize the space effectively. This has a negative impact on our relaxation time, which is essential for maintaining focus and productivity in classes.\nWe humbly request your kind intervention to enhance the facilities in the common room by providing more chairs and tables, introducing additional indoor games like carrom and chess, and ensuring a regular supply of updated reading materials. These improvements would greatly contribute to the overall well-being and academic performance of the students.\nWe are hopeful for your understanding and prompt action in this regard.\nThank you for considering our request.\nYours faithfully,\nSumona Akter On behalf of the students Khulna Zilla School"

He is quite familiar both in cities and towns. Generally, he lives in a slum. Though he works hard from morning till late night, he leads a poor life. He does not consider the condition of the weather. He works hard despite foul weather. Sometimes there arises a dispute between him and the passenger for fare. If he falls sick, his family members fall in distress. All of them have to starve. He cannot enjoy peace and happiness. He also suffers from inferiority complex. Besides, his children cannot hope for a bright future. Sometimes some passengers behave roughly with him. But he does not have sufficient strength to tackle it. Some rickshaw-pullers try to cheat the passengers. He takes rest here and there or sitting on his rickshaw. On the whole, his life is full of sufferings. To support his, family, he has to drive the rickshaw despite his sickness. In fact, he leads a poor and subhuman life."
