To publish it smoothly (সুচারুভাবে), a magazine committee of usually nine members is formed in a general meeting. The members of the committee are chief patron (পৃষ্ঠপোষক), adviser (উপদেষ্টা), editor, assistant editors, business editors, proofreaders, assistant proofreaders, etc. Generally, the Headteacher holds the post of chief patron and a senior teacher becomes the adviser. The editor, business editors and the assistant proofreaders are selected from the students. A magazine fund (তহবিল) is also made up (গঠন করা হয়) of the school 'Magazine Fee'. The editor invites (আহ্বান করে) writings both in Bangla and English. Then, after proper scrutiny (স্ক্রুটিনি-নিরীক্ষণ), the best ones are selected for publishing. The business editors collect some money by selling spaces (স্থান) in the magazine for advertisements. Generally, the magazine has two sections - Bangla and English. There are messages (বাণী) from the Headteacher and the secretary (সচিব) of the school, annual reports, essays, short stories, short plays, etc. in it. It also contains jokes, quizzes (ধাঁধা) and puzzles (শব্দ ধাঁধা), etc. Most of the articles (বিষয়) are written by the students. Besides, a few articles are contributed (প্রদান করা) by the teachers. A school magazine promotes (উন্নয়ন করা) team-spirit (দলীয় উদ্দীপনা), fosters (উৎসাহিত করে) to express the dormant power of thinking as well as writing of the young learners. It also helps flourish (বিকশিত হওয়া) themselves as future writers and poets."

A journey by train is especially pleasant, because it is safe and comfortable. Whenever I get a chance to travel by train, I never miss it. Last month, I enjoyed a journey by train with my family members from Dhaka to Chattogram. It was one of the most enjoyable journeys in my life.\n\nOn the scheduled day, we reached Kamalapur Railway Station early in the morning. The station was very crowded and noisy. We bought our tickets and got into the train. I managed my seat beside a window. Suddenly, the train blew its whistle and I jumped. Then the train began to move.\n\nAt first, the train was moving slowly. After a while, it began to move in full speed. Trees, houses, people, etc. all seemed going backwards. Gentle breeze began to enter our compartment. The rhythmic sound and jerking of the train made me very excited. I wanted to put my head out of the window, but my parents did not let me do that. I looked through the window and saw many beautiful sights. The paddy fields and other trees were very beautiful to look at. They were tossing their heads in the breeze. While the train was crossing a bridge, I saw some country-boats in the rivers. Sometimes, our train moved through open fields. I saw the farmers working and the children playing cricket or football there. All these gave me new and exciting experiences.\n\nOur compartment was crowded. There was no vacant seat. Some of the passengers were talking on various topics. Some were reading newspapers or magazines. Some were sleeping, too. Sometimes, hawkers came with various items. Our train made stops at a few big and small'stations. When our train entered Chattogram, I saw many hills.\n\nAt last, the train reached Chattogram station at noon. And our journey ended. The journey gave me immense pleasure and experience. I wish I could make it again and again."
