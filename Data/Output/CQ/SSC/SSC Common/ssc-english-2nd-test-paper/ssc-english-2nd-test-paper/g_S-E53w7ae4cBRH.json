          "explanation": "The Life of a Farmer\n\nA farmer is the person, who cultivates lands and grows different types of crops to earn his bread. Generally, a farmer is a poor man and lives in the village. In Bangladesh, the life of a farmer is pitiable. Most of the farmers have no land of their own. So, most of the time he is to cultivate the land of others. Usually, a farmer is an illiterate person. He does not know how to plough his land scientifically. He cannot apply scientific method. He has only a pair of bullocks and some handmade tools. Often he does not have enough money to buy seeds, fertilizer or pesticide. As a result, he cannot produce more food for himself and his family. He lives from hand to mouth. He also has pleasures and pains in life. If he gets a good harvest, his face beams with joy. On the other hand, if the harvest is not good, his sorrows know no bounds. He works very hard to prepare the land for planting or sowing crops. As the farmers grow and reap the harvest, we have our food. By working hard in the field, he grows a bumper crop which helps develop our national economy. We know that ours is an agricultural country. More than 80 percent people are directly or indirectly engaged in agriculture. Our economy is also mostly dependent on agriculture. So, to promote the development of national economy, the farmers should be helped with agricultural subsidies by the government. They should be encouraged to use tractors instead of the age-old ploughs. They should also be taught to use the modem cultivation methods. This is how, the life of a farmer can be developed."

          "explanation": "Science is a great blessing to mankind. Nothing better has happened in the history of man than the advent of science in human life. The world into which science came was a world of ignorance, suffering and hardship. Science has come to relieve us from sufferings, to remove our ignorance and to lighten our toil.\nScience is a faithful servant of man. It serves us in all walks of life. It is our servant in the home, in the field and in the factory. Science has transformed our daily life. Gone are the days when only the rich men could afford luxuries. Science has made them cheap and has brought them within the reach of everybody. Science has produced goods on a large market. These are sold at cheap rates in every market. Besides, books, music and all other forms of entertainment have been brought to our door. Radio, television, cinema help us in passing our time and also provide education to us.\nScience is our most faithful medical attendant. It shows every care for our health. Because of science we are cured of many diseases. It has given us the power to reduce epidemics. No longer are cholera, plague and small pox the scourge of mankind. Moreover, science has helped in reducing the death rate and has also enhanced the living age of humans.\nScience has reduced distance and made travelling a pleasure. Science has annihilated time and space. Trains roar through deserts, jungles and mountains while aeroplanes fly across thousands of kilometres. Thus, the work of months and years can now be completed in hours.\nScience is the greatest blessing to the poor housewife. A thousand devices have been placed at her disposal to reduce her toil. There is electricity run kitchens in which cooking is pleasure. There is no dirt, no smoke and cooking with the help of gas and electricity can be done in the twinkling of an eye. Electricity helps her in washing and pressing clothes and even in cleaning floors.\nOn the other hand, science has provided us with computers and machines which have greatly increased our efficiency. We are better connected to people today and information is only a click of the mouse away.\nMan no longer needs to do the back breaking job of digging into mines with bare hands or tilling the soil with animals. Every factory is a standing tribute from the care and comforts that science has brought into our life.\nScience educates us in many ways. Large printing presses produce number of books at cheap rates. News is brought to us from every corner of the world through the newspaper, radios and television.\nHowever science has done a great disservice to mankind in the field of armaments. Weapons of mass destruction, nuclear weapons and sophisticated armament have endangered our lives and threaten to destroy the world. However, it depends on us whether we will destroy our world or make our life more beautiful and comfortable with the help of science"
