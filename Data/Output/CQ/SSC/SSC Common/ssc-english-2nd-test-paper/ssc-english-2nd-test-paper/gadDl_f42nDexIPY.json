He should also read newspapers, magazines, literature, history, etc.\n\nA student should remember that character is the crown of a man: Therefore, he has to cultivate good manners and other noble virtues. All moral qualities like honesty, modesty, truthfuilness, discipline, perseverance, sincerity, punctuality must be acquired during this time.\n\nHe should also render some services to his society and country. He should make the illiterate literate. He can make the farmers aware of the modern methods of cultivation. In population control, he can play an important role.\n\nA student must obey and honour his parents. When they are sick, helpless or old, he must serve them. He should-also be obedient to his teachers and other superiors.\n\nA student must not waste his time and energy. So, he must possess a sound health by taking regular physical exercise, taking part in games and sports.
