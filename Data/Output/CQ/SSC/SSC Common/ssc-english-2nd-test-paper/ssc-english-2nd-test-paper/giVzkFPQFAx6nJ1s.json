          "explanation": "Price Hike\nPrice hike means rise in prices of essential commodities. It is a common phenomenon in our country. The prices of essential commodities are increasing by leaps and bounds. Indeed, price of daily commodities has gone beyond the reach of the common pëople: There are many causes of price hike. Insufficient supply of daily commodities is mainly responsible for price hike. Our population is increasing rapidly, but our food production is not increasing proportionately. For this, we do not get enough food in comparison to our increasing demands. Moreover, frequent natural 'disasters like flood, drought, cyclone, etc. hamper our food production, which accelerates the price hike of essential food items. On the other hand, hoarding is another important factór of soaring price level..Some dishonest traders devoid of morality hoard essential goods and create artificial shortage in the market. Then they sell the goods at higher price. Political unrest like strikes is also responsible for a surge in price. Lack of market supervision, black marketing and smuggling also contribute to price hike. The phenomenon has increased the suffering of the common people. The poor and the middle class are mostly affected by it. But, the worst sufferers of it are those who live from hand to mouth. They find it hard to feed their family members. Some of them remain halffed. As a result, they suffer from malnutrition. Unusual price hike hampers the economic balance of a country. The government should take effective steps to tackle the situation, most notably by increasing food production. Each and every shop must have a price chart fixed by the government. The law enforcing agencies should be deployed in the market places to monitor the market price. Legal actions must be taken against the dishonest businessmen and hoarders. Actually, people of all walks of life should also cоoperate with the government."

          "explanation": "Wonders of Modern Science\nScience means knowledge gained through experiment and research. Science does many things for the development of human civilization. The modern age is a gift of science. We are passing our days under the great influence of science. We see the influence of science at every step of our life. It has changed the way we live. It has invented many things for our comfort. Today we feel the presence of science in-our everyday life. The pen we write with, the shirt we put on, the bicycle we ride all are the invention of science. With the touch of a switch, we get our lights dazzling, fans whirling and radios and televisions singing and talking.\nThe invention of electricity has brought about а revolutionary change in the history of human civilization. Electricity helps to operate machine, factories and other heavy industries. Electric fans, lights, and heaters have made our life more enjoyable. Moreover, our agricultural and industrial development is fully dependent on modern science. We now cultivate our land with power tillers. The production of crops is increasing day by day with the help of chemical fertilizers and insecticides. Science also helps us in inventing new hybrid seeds. In industrial areas, science has made a significant contribution. From needles to rockets, everything produced in. industry is the contribution of science. Communication is considered the motion of life. Science has brought about a great change in our communication system also. Invention of speedy transports like bus, train, airplane, truck, ship etc. has made transportation faster and comfortable. Rocket and space shuttle are great wonders of modern science. By using them, man has already conquered the moon and is now preparing for the Mars. Besides, satellite television has added a new dimension to our communication system. It has brought the whole world to our living rоom. Moreover, telephone, FAX, E-mail, cellular phone, and internet have turned the whole world into a global village. We can instantly communicate with our friends and family through them.\nIn the medical field, science has done unbelievable improvements. Blood transfusion and transplantation of other organs have become possible with the help of science. The invention of X-ray, ECG, Ultrasonography, penicillin, CT scan, biopsy, various life-saving antibiotic, etc. has worked wonders in the field of medical science. Modern medical science has given eyes to the blind, hearing to the deaf, legs to the lame and what not.\nHowever, the inventions of science could also be destructive also if they are misused. By inventing atom bomb, hydrogen bomb, missiles, and other explosives, men are now destroying the human race and its beautiful creation in the world. The destruction caused by dropping atom bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II bears testimony to it. In conclusion, the wonders of science cannot be described in words. But if it is misused, it brings destruction. So, it should be utilised for the greater benefit of human beings."
