The shape of our national flag is rectangular. The ratio of its length and width is 10 : 6 10: 6 10 : 6 . It is made of cotton, linen or silk. It bears a combination of two colours. The major part of it is deep green and there is a red circle in the half-mast, on our national mourning days. Our national flag is the source of our spirit, hope, and aspiration: So, we must defend our independence at any cost and save the existence and prestige of our national flag."

          "explanation": "Hobby means one's favourite pastime. Usually, hobby is not meant to support someone financially, but a way to derive pleasure out of it. Without it, life becomes dull and monotonous.\nDifferent people have different hobbies. Some choose gardening, some like drawing picture; on the other hand, some may like rearing birds or catching fish, collecting stamps and so on. But whatever is the hobby, it has its own uniqueness and one chooses his or her hobby on the basis of what he or she enjoys most. My favourite hobby is gardening.\nI love flowers very much. So, I have made a flower garden. It is in front of our house. I have planted the seedlings of roses, jasmine, sunflower, China rose, cosmos, marigold, beli, etc. in my garden. In a corner of the garden, I also grow some seasonal vegetables. I have put a strong bamboo-made fence around my garden so that cattle or other animals cannot enter the garden and do any harm to the plants.\nMy garden is a great source of passing my leisure time. Every day, I work in my garden for some time. In the morning, I water the plants, make the soil loose and weed out the grasses. In the evening, I water the plants again. On holidays, I pass some time there too.\nI truly love my hobby; it keeps me happy and cheerful. When I get bored with my studies or other works, I go to my garden. The pleasant sight of the garden and the sweet fragrance of the flowers remove my boredom. It is a great source of joy and recreation for me. When various colourful flowers bloom, my garden looks like a paradise. Most importantly, my hobby never hampers my study.\nMy hobby is very beneficial to me. Before I made the garden, I used to feel sick all the time. I lost my appetite and became very weak. But when I started working in my garden, my health began to improve. Besides, the vegetables in my garden also provide nutrition to our family and in the way save some money for my parents.\nA hobby is necessary for all of us. But we must not spend too much time in pursuit of our hobby. We must perform our main tasks first and then we should spend our leisure time pursuing our hobby."
