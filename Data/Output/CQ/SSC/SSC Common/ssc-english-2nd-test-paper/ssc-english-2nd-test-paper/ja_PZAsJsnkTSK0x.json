          "question": "",
          "explanation": "Price Hike\nA price hike refers to a sudden or gradual increase in the cost of goods or services, often triggered by various economic, social, or political factors. It can result from rising production costs, such as higher raw material prices, increased labor wages, or escalating energy expenses. External factors like inflation, supply chain disruptions, and global crises, including natural disasters or geopolitical conflicts, also contribute to price hikes. For businesses, a price hike can be a necessary step to maintain profitability and sustain operations amidst growing expenses. However, for consumers, it often leads to financial strain as they face higher living costs and reduced purchasing power. Essential commodities such as food, fuel, and healthcare services are particularly sensitive to price hikes, disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income households. Governments and policymakers may intervene by implementing subsidies, price controls, or tax reductions to mitigate the impact on vulnerable populations. In some cases, however, such measures are temporary and fail to address the root causes of the problem. On a broader scale, price hikes can alter consumer behavior, leading to reduced demand or a shift towards more affordable alternatives. While businesses may experience short-term gains, sustained price hikes can harm the economy by curbing consumer spending and triggering a slowdown. Effective management of economic policies, alongside innovations in production and supply chain efficiency, is essential to control price hikes and ensure economic stability."

          "explanation": "\n\nRural Development\n\nRural development means improving the lives of people who live in villages. There are approximately 87,000 villages in our country, comprising about 75 % 75 \\% 75%\n\n\nof the population. Village life can be hard because villagers often lack good facilities, like clean water, health care, and proper education.\n\nThe govèmment and some organizations are working on rural development of our country to help village people have a better-life. They build roads, bridges, and schools. Newly built roads allow farmers to take their crops to the market easily, which helps them earn more money.\n\nAnother part of rural development is teaching farmers about scientific methods of farming. In this way, the farmers can grow more food. Moreover, the farmers can feed more people as well as earn a better income. Some programs also teach villagers skills like sewing, handicraft making, and fish farming so that they can eam money from different sources.\n\nHealth care is also important. Mobile health clinics and -small hospitals are built in villages so that people can get basic medical treatment. Clean water and proper sanitation are also provided to help prevent diseases. Electricity is now reaching more villages through solar power and new electric lines. This allows children to study at night, and villagers can use electricity for various purposes.\n\n\nInformation and Communication Technology is also becoming important in villages. ICT centers and digital. services help villagers learn new skills, find farming tips, and even sell their products online. Through mobile phones and computers, farmers can check weather updates, which helps them plan their work. Students in villages can also use internet for learning and connecting with the outside world. These tools help villagers improve their knowledge and earn more money,\n\nRural development is very important for the progress of a country. By helping villages grow, the whole country can progress. Rural development not only makes village life better but also builds a brighter future for all.\n"
