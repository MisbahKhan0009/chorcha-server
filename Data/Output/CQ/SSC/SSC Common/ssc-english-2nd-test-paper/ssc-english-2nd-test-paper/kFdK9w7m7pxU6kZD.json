          "explanation": "A school magazine contains (থাকে) the literary (সাহিত্যবিষয়ক) works and other information (তথ্য) of a school. It is published once a year. To publish it smoothly (সুচারুভাবে), a magazine committee of usually nine members is formed in a general meeting. The members of the committee are chief patron (পৃষ্ঠপোষক), adviser (উপদেষ্টা), editor, assistant editors, business editors, proofreaders, assistant proofreaders, etc. Generally, the Headteacher holds the post of chief patron and a senior teacher becomes the adviser. The editor, business editors and the assistant proofreaders are selected from the students. A magazine fund (তহবিল) is also made up (গঠন করা হয়) of the school 'Magazine Fee'. The editor invites (আহ্বান করে) writings both in Bangla and English. Then, after proper scrutiny (স্কুটিনি-নিরীক্ষণ), the best ones are selected for publishing. The business editors collect some money by selling spaces (স্থান) in the magazine for advertisements. Generally, the magazine has two sections - Bangla and English. There are messages (বাণী) from the Headteacher and the secretary (সচিব) of the school, annual reports, essays, short stories, short plays, etc. in it. It also contains jokes, quizzes (ধাঁধা) and puzzles (শব্দ ধাঁধা), etc. Most of the articles (বিষয়) are written by the students. Besides, a few articles are contributed (প্রদান করা) by the teachers. A school magazine promotes (উন্নয়ন করা) team-spirit (দলীয় উদ্দীপনা), fosters (উৎসাহিত করে) to express the dormant power of thinking as well as writing of the young learners. It also helps flourish (বিকশিত হওয়া) themselves as future writers and poets."

          "explanation": "Science in Everyday Life\n\nScience is a great blessing to mankind. Nothing better has happened in the history of man than the advent of science in human life. The world into which science came was a world of ignorance, suffering and hardship. Science has come to relieve us from sufferings, to remove our ignorance and to lighten our toil.\nScience is a faithful servant of man. It serves us in all walks of life. It is our servant in the home, in the field and in the factory. Science has transformed our daily life. Gone are the days when only the rich men could afford luxuries. Science has made them cheap and has brought them within the reach of everybody. Science has produced goods on a large market. These are sold at cheap rates in every market. Besides, books, music and all other forms of entertainment have been brought to our door. Radio, television, cinema help us in passing our time and also provide education to us.\nScience is our most faithful medical attendant. It shows every care for our health. Because of science we are cured of many diseases. It has given us the power to reduce epidemics. No longer are cholera, plague and small pox the scourge of mankind. Moreover, science has helped in reducing the death rate and has also enhanced the living age of humans.\nScience has reduced distance and made travelling a pleasure. Science has annihilated time and space. Trains roar through deserts, jungles and mountains while aeroplanes fly across thousands of kilometres. Thus, the work of months and years can now be completed in hours.\nScience is the greatest blessing to the poor housewife. A thousand devices have been placed at her disposal to reduce her toil. There is electricity run kitchens in which cooking is pleasure. There is no dirt, no smoke and cooking with the help of gas and electricity can be done in the twinkling of an eye. Electricity helps her in washing and pressing clothes and even in cleaning floors.\nOn the other hand, science has provided us with computers and machines which have greatly increased our efficiency. We are better connected to people today and information is only a click of the mouse away.\nMan no longer needs to do the back breaking job of digging into mines with bare hands or tilling the soil with animals. Every factory is a standing tribute from the care and comforts that science has brought into our life.\nScience educates us in many ways. Large printing presses produce number of books at cheap rates. News is brought to us from every corner of the world through the newspaper, radios and television.\nHowever science has done a great disservice to mankind in the field of armaments. Weapons of mass destruction, nuclear weapons and sophisticated armament have endangered our lives and threaten to destroy the world. However, it depends on us whether we will destroy our world or make our life more beautiful and comfortable with the help of science"
