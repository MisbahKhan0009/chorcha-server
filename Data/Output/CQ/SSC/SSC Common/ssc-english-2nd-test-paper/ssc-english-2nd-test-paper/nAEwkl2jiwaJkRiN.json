Our school library is not well-equipped. Quality books are not available here. Moreover, if a student wants to read reference books, s/he finds it. difficult to find one there. The librarian cannot issue books to the students of Class X as necessary books are inadequate in the library. The SSC examinees often fail to make notes and their preparation is, thus, hampered.\nTherefore, we hope that you would be kind enough to consider the problem and increase the number of quality books in the library so that the students can meet their need.\n\nYours truly,\nMita Afsari\nClass X, Roll No: 1\nOn behalf of the students of Nurpur High School"
