As you are aware, the common room is a vital space for students to refresh their minds and engage in recreational activities during breaks. However, the current setup is insufficient to meet the increasing needs of the students.\nThe common room lacks adequate seating arrangements, indoor game facilities, and updated newspapers and magazines. During recess, it becomes overcrowded, leaving many students without the opportunity to utilize the space effectively. This has a negative impact on our relaxation time, which is essential for maintaining focus and productivity in classes.\nWe humbly request your kind intervention to enhance the facilities in the common room by providing more chairs and tables, introducing additional indoor games like carrom and chess, and ensuring a regular supply of updated reading materials. These improvements would greatly contribute to the overall well-being and academic performance of the students.\nWe are hopeful for your understanding and prompt action in this regard.\nThank you for considering our request.\nYours faithfully,\nSumona Akter On behalf of the students Khulna Zilla School"

          "explanation": "A school magazine contains (থাকে) the literary (সাহিত্যবিষয়ক) works and other information (তথ্য) of a school. It is published once a year. To publish it smoothly (সুচারুভাবে), a magazine committee of usually nine members is formed in a general meeting. The members of the committee are chief patron (পৃষ্ঠপোষক), adviser (উপদেষ্টা), editor, assistant editors, business editors, proofreaders, assistant proofreaders, etc. Generally, the Headteacher holds the post of chief patron and a senior teacher becomes the adviser. The editor, business editors and the assistant proofreaders are selected from the students. A magazine fund (তহবিল) is also made up (গঠন করা হয়) of the school 'Magazine Fee'. The editor invites (আহ্বান করে) writings both in Bangla and English. Then, after proper scrutiny (স্কুটিনি-নিরীক্ষণ), the best ones are selected for publishing. The business editors collect some money by selling spaces (স্থান) in the magazine for advertisements. Generally, the magazine has two sections - Bangla and English. There are messages (বাণী) from the Headteacher and the secretary (সচিব) of the school, annual reports, essays, short stories, short plays, etc. in it. It also contains jokes, quizzes (ধাঁধা) and puzzles (শব্দ ধাঁধা), etc. Most of the articles (বিষয়) are written by the students. Besides, a few articles are contributed (প্রদান করা) by the teachers. A school magazine promotes (উন্নয়ন করা) team-spirit (দলীয় উদ্দীপনা), fosters (উৎসাহিত করে) to express the dormant power of thinking as well as writing of the young learners. It also helps flourish (বিকশিত হওয়া) themselves as future writers and poets."

          "explanation": "The period of life, which we spend to receive education in educational institutions is called student life. It is the most important and valuable period in one's life. This is the time, when the seeds of future life are sown. For this, it is called the sowing season of our life. During this period, a student has to do certain things to be successful in life.\nThe first and foremost duty of a student is to study hard. However, he must not confine himself to the prescribed books only. He must read newspaper, magazines, novels, dramas, etc. during his leisure. This will widen his mental horizon and enable him to be acquainted with the affairs of the world. Moreover, he should follow some rules and regulations. He should not waste his valuable time. He should be regular and punctual in his classes. He should take part in all types of extra-curricular activities such as singing, dancing, reciting, debating, painting, scouting, etc.\nA student should bear in mind that character is the crown of a man. So, he has to cultivate good manners and other noble virtues. He must not keep bad company. He should abstain from any type of bad, habits. All moral qualities like honesty, modesty, truthfulness, discipline, perseverance, sincerity, punctuality must be acquired during this period. He must be respectful to his parents, teachers and other superiors. He has to render helping hands to the helpless. He should be polite to all and rude to none. 'Simple living and high thinking' must be the motto of his life.\nMoreover, students should also render some duties and responsibilities to the society. They can teach the illiterate people about family planning, health, nutrition, child rearing, scientific method of cultivation etc. During natural calamities, students should come forward to help the affected people. They should collect food, clothes, medicine etc. and distribute them among the affected people.In addition to these, a student has to be careful of his health as a sound mind lies in a sound body. Good health is the key to success. So, he should take physical exercise regularly and take part in various games and sports. Besides, he should always keep himself neat and clean.\nStudent life paves the way for one's future. So, every student should utilise this period of life in order to do something great in future."
