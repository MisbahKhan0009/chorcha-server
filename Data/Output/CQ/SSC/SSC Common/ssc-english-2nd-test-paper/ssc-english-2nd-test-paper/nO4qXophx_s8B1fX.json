          "explanation": "Deforestation\n\nDeforestation refers to the cutting and burning down of forests at random. It is just the opposite of the concept of tree plantation. In a word, it is the destruction of trees and plants in our environment. The main causes of deforestation include rapid urbanization, agricultural expansion, need for land for housing and industries, illegal logging, need of furnitures etc. It has many adverse effects on our environment and our life. It destroys the ecological balance of our environment and our life. Due to deforestation, many species of birds and animals have already been extinct and many of them are faced with the threat of extinction. Because of deforestation, it does not rain adequately and this causes long-term drought. This drought may turn the whole country into a desert. Apart from this, deforestation also hampers our agricultural production. In fact, our environment is going to be uninhabitable for deforestation. However, there is a way to save ourselves and our environment from it and that is, we should start a mass campaign for tree plantation. For this, we should raise awareness among the mass people about the adverse sides of deforestation as well as about the importance of tree' plantation. My suggestion, in this regard, is that we should plant at least one tree every month and if we cut one, we should plant three. I think each man or woman, old or young should come forward and plant at least one tree to save our existence."

Our school library is not well-equipped. Quality books are not available here. Moreover, if a student wants to read reference books, s/he finds it difficult to find one there. The librarian cannot issue books to the students of Class X as necessary books are inadequate in the library. The SSC examinees often fail to make notes and their preparation is, thus, hampered.\nTherefore, we hope that you would be kind enough to consider the problem and increase the number of quality books in the library so that the students can meet their need.\n\nYours truly,\nMita Afsari\nClass X, Roll No: 1\nOn behalf of the students of\nNurpur High School"

          "explanation": "Unemployment Problem in Bangladesh\n\nUnemployment is one of the biggest problems in Bangladesh. When people who are able to work do not get any job, it is called unemployment. It creates many difficulties in family life and in the whole country. Every year many young men and women finish school, college, and university, but many of them still cannot find a suitable job.\nOne main reason for unemployment in Bangladesh is overpopulation. Our country has a large number of people, but job opportunities are not increasing at the same speed. Many people also depend only on government jobs, which are very limited. Another reason is lack of proper skills. Many students study only for exams but do not learn practical skills like computer training, communication skills, or technical work. As a result, they cannot match the needs of modern workplaces.\nIn rural areas, most people depend on farming, but farming alone cannot give jobs to everyone. Natural disasters such as floods and cyclones also destroy crops and increase joblessness. Many existing factories and industries are not enough to employ a huge number of young people. Corruption and lack of good planning also make the problem worse.\nUnemployment creates frustration among the youth. Some people fall into crime or drug addiction because they feel hopeless. Families suffer when the earning member cannot find work. The country also loses productivity. To solve this problem, the government should create more industries and support small businesses. Technical and vocational education should be improved so that students can learn useful skills. Young people should be encouraged to try freelancing, entrepreneurship, and self-employment. Proper training and guidance can also help them find better jobs at home and abroad.\nUnemployment is a serious issue, but with good planning, teamwork, and skill development, Bangladesh can reduce this problem and build a better future for its youth."
