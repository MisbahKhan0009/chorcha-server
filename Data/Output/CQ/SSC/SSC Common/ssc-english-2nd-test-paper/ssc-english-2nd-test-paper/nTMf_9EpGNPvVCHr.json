          "question": "",
          "explanation": "Tree Plantation/ Importance of Trees in Our Life/Why More Trees Should Be Planted\nMen depend much on trees. Trees provide us with oxygen, food, furniture, etc. and take carbondioxide which is harmful to human beings and all animals. So to say, our life on earth largely depends upon trees. But it is a matter of great regret that we are cutting down trees very unwisely for some quick profit. It is really a matter of great concern .\nFirst, it is important to know what trees do for us. Man needs oxygen: In every breath we take oxygen in and leave carbon dioxide out. Trees leave oxygen out and take carbon dioxide in. Thus they provide us with the most necessary thing we need on earth. Trees also give us food and shelter . We cannot live without the help of trees.\nBut at present people are cutting down trees at a large scale. There are many reasons of cutting down trees. Man is cutting down them mainly for firewood and furniture. Every day our population is increasing. So, more firewood and furniture are needed for the additional people.\nTropical rain forests are also being cleared at a high rate. It takes thousands of years to grow a tropical rain forest. But, at present, they are being cleared at the rate of fourteen square miles per hour.\nOn the other hand, the effect of deforestation is very harmful and dangerous. For this, 'Greenhouse Effect' has occurred and the temperature of the world is increasing day by day. Heat waves have grasped many countries. Besides, ice is melting in the South and North Poles. The level of water in the sea is increasing on. This may lead to worldwide flood. Measures should immediately be taken to prevent deforestation. So, we should plant five trees if we cut down one. We should also try our best to stop curting down trees and save the environment. Otherwise, our future will be very difficult and uninhabitable."

          "explanation": "\n\nHobby means one's favourite pastime. Usually, hobby is not meant to support someone financially, but a way to derive pleasure out of it. Without it, life becomes dull and monotonous.\n\nDifferent people have different hobbies. Some choose gardening, some like drawing picture; on the other hand, some may like rearing birds or catching fish, collecting stamps and so on. But whatever is the hobby, it has its own uniqueness and one chooses his or her hobby on the basis of what he or she enjoys most. My : favourite hobby is gardening.\n\nI love flowers very much. So, I have made a flower garden. It is in front of our house. I have planted the seedlings of roses, jasmine, sunflower, China rose, cosmos, marigold, beli, etc. in my garden. In a corner of the garden, I also grow some seasonal vegetables. I have put a strong bamboo-made fence around my garden so that cattle or other animals cannot enter the garden and do any harm to the plants.\n\nMy garden is a great source of passing my leisure time. Every day, I work in my garden for some time. In the morning, I water the plants, make the soil loose and weed out the grasses. In the evening, I water the plants again. On holidays, I pass some time there too."
