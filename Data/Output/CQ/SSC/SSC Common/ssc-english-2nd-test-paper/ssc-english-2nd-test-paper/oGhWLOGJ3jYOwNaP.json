          "question": "",
          "explanation": "Tree Plantation\nTree plantation means planting trees on a large scale in a planned way. Trees are our friends. They give us shade and soothe our eyes with their green colour. They give us various kinds of fruits. They give us firewood as fuel for cooking. They give us timber for furniture, doors and windows, boats, electric poles, railway slippers; etc. They give us rubber too. Trees take in carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. Sufficient trees cause sufficient rainfall and prevent draught. Trees along the roadside and coastal areas prevent erosion and tidal bore. But many inconsiderate people are cutting down trees for their selfish interests. So, we are losing trees. If there is no tree, there will be no civilization. In fact, the loss of trees will take our existence to the verge of extinction. The earth will be no more habitable. Hence, tree plantation must be taken as a project. The more we plant trees, the more our environment will be balanced and greener. In Bangladesh, tree plantation is compulsory because we do not have as much forest as we require to maintain the ecological balance. There is no specific time to plant trees. We can plant trees any time of the year based on the type of the trees. Park, yard, urban areas, open field, balcony, rooftops; roadside places, etc. are best places to plant trees. To make life peaceful, there is no alternative to tree plantation."
