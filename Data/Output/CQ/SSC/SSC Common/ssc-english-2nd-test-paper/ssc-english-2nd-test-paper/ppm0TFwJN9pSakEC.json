As you are aware, the common room is a vital space for students to refresh their minds and engage in recreational activities during breaks. However, the current setup is insufficient to meet the increasing needs of the students.\nThe common room lacks adequate seating arrangements, indoor game facilities, and updated newspapers and magazines. During recess, it becomes overcrowded, leaving many students without the opportunity to utilize the space effectively. This has a negative impact on our relaxation time, which is essential for maintaining focus and productivity in classes.\nWe humbly request your kind intervention to enhance the facilities in the common room by providing more chairs and tables, introducing additional indoor games like carrom and chess, and ensuring a regular supply of updated reading materials. These improvements would greatly contribute to the overall well-being and academic performance of the students.\nWe are hopeful for your understanding and prompt action in this regard.\nThank you for considering our request.\nYours faithfully,\nSumona Akter On behalf of the students Khulna Zilla School"

To publish it smoothly, a magazine committee of usually nine members is formed in a general meeting. The members of the committee are chief, patron, adviser, editor, assistant editors,, business editors, proofreaders, assistant proofreaders, etc. Generally, the Headteacher holds the post of chief patron and a senior teacher becomes the adviser. The editor, business editors and the assistant proofreaders are selected from the students. A magazine fund is also made up of the school 'Magazine Fee'. The editor invites writings both in Bangla and English. Then, after proper scrutiny, the best ones are selected for publishing. The business editors collect some money by selling spaces in the magazine for advertisements. Generally, the magazine has two sections Bangla and English. There are messages from the Headteacher and the secretary of the school, annual reports, essays, short stories, short plays, etc. in it. It also contains jokes, quizzes and puzzles, etc. Most of the articles are written by the students. Besides, a few articles are contributed by the teachers. A school magazine promotes team-spirit, fosters to express the dormant power of thinking as well as writing of the young learners. It also helps flourish themselves as future writers and poets."

          "explanation": "There are six seasons in Bangladesh, the land of natural beauty. They are summer, rainy, autumn, late autumn, winter and spring. Every season has its unique features. Of all these seasons I like the spring most.. This season consists of the Bangla months of Falgun and Chaitra. It is the best, the loveliest and the most charming of all the seasons. There are some specific reaons why I like the spring most.\nTo me, the winter is very cold, dull and lifeless. In summer, the scorching sun, hot days and nights make life miserable. The heavy rain and frequent floods in the rainy season bring great sufferings to the people. The autumn and the late autumn have also more or less the disadvantages like the summer, rainy and winter seasons. But the spring has none of the inconveniences of these seasons. Coming after winter, it captivates the hearts of all.\nWith the arrival of the spring, nature puts on a lively look. Everything in the nature looks fresh. The sky looks' clear and blue, trees put forth new leaves, and the flowers of charming colour and scent bloom in trees. Bees and butterflies hum and fly from one flower to another. During this season, gentle breeze begins to blow. Sweet twitters of birds are heard. The melodious notes of the cuckoo please our ears. All these charming and pleasing sights and sounds have a positive influence on our mind. Everywhere there is joy and mirth. People also enjoy a better health. Besides, during this time, various kinds of vegetables and fruits are also available. The season has a few disadvantages, too. During this season, some people suffer from diseases like diarrhoea, cholera, chicken-pox, etc.\nIn spite of its few disadvantages, its positive aspects are overwhelming. The convenience it offers fascinates all. That's why, I like the spring season most."
