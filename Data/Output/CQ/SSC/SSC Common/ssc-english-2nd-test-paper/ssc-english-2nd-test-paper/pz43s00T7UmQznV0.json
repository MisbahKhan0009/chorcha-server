          "explanation": "Environment Pollution\nThe environment refers to the air, water and land in which people, animals and plants live. Human beings, animals, plants, air, water and soil are the main elements of the environment. These elements should be pollution free for our healthy living. But when they are polluted and their balance is disrupted, it is called environmental pollution. Nowadays, almost everywhere, our environment is getting polluted. In many places of our country, the environment has become extremely polluted. We, ourselves, are responsible for this situation. Industries and factories emit huge amount of smoke, gases and fume. Motor vehicles also emit large amount of smoke and gases. All these cause air pollution. Water is polluted from the dumping of industrial wastes and by chemical fertilizers and insecticides. Sound pollution occurs due to the indiscriminate use of vehicle horns, loud speakers, microphones, etc. Soil is polluted by harmful chemical fertilizers, pesticides and insecticides. Trees play an important role .. in conserving the environment. Trees absorb carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. Thus, they save the environment. But trees are being cut down for different commercial purposes. This needs to be stopped for the sake of keeping our environment healthy. Environment pollution is a great threat to our existence. It changes the world's climate and brings about different kinds of natural disasters. Thus, the world is getting unsuitable for living. To make life healthy and comfortable, we should keep the environment clean and pollution free."

          "explanation": "A Rainy Day\nRainy days are always special, especially in the village: One morning in August, dark clouds gathered in the sky, and the air felt cool and fresh. I woke up to the sound of raindrops tapping on the roof of our tinshaded house. The sound was soothing, and it made me feel cozy inside.\nAs the rain started to pour, I looked outside. The fields were soaked, and the water filled the small ditches around our home. My mother was busy preparing breakfast, and the aroma of freshly cooked 'Khichuri' filled the air. My father, who is a farmer, was excited because the rain is very important for our crops. It helps rice and vegetables grow strong.\nThrough the window, I saw children running and playing in the rain. They splashed in the puddles, laughing and enjoying the cool water. Some villagers were using waterproof cover to protect their crops from getting damaged by the heavy rain. Others gathered in groups, sharing stories and enjoying the moment together.\nWhile the rain is good for our crops, it can also cause problems. In some parts of the village, the water level rises, and roads go under water. People need to be careful and sometimes use boats to move around. As the day went on, the rain slowly stopped, and a beautiful rainbow appeared in the sky. Everyone admired the colorful sight. A rainy day is a mix of joy and hard work. It brings us together and reminds us of the beauty of nature. I love rainy days because they make our village look frèsh and green.\n"
