          "explanation": "Uses and Abuses of Mobile Phone\nMobile phone is one of the latest inventions of modern science. It is a small cellular phone that can be easily carried with us. It has made our everyday life easy-going and tension free. We can now communicate easily with others through this. As the networks of different mobile operators have covered almost the whole country, we do not have any chance to get lost. Our friends and family members can easily find us no matter how far we stay. Moreover, we can use Internet through mobile phone and communicate with others very easily. Nowadays, it is also used as the alternative to computers because there are many kinds of apps in the latest mobile phones, which perform different types of work like sending and receiving e-mail, using social networks, writing and editing documents, capturing photos, etc. Because of its great benefits, the number of mobile phone users is increasing day by day. But every positive thing has some negatives aspects as well. Mobile phone is also not an exception to this. Teenagers often spoil their valuable time by talking to their friends for a long time. They are often found to talk to their friends for long two or three hours at night. Different mobile operators often offer some mid-night free or low cost calls. Students mostly take this advantage and thus kill their time. Besides, hijackers, robbers and different anti-social activists often commit crime by communicating among themselves through mobile phone. Scientists are warning that excessive use of mobile phone can cause brain cancer and hamper the mental growth of children. But despite these disadvantages, we use mobile phone as it has been a part and parcel in our daily life."

          "explanation": "My Childhood Memories\nMan loves to turn back to his past and feel nostalgic. Childhood is an important part of human life as many events of both pleasure and pain take place during that period.\nTo me childhood is the sweetest period in a man's life. The 'memories of my childhood haunt (তাড়িত করে) me like a passion (ঘোর, মোহ) very often. Whenever I feel very lonely or dejected, I dive into the memories of my childhood, remove my loneliness and fill my heart with happiness. Then, I wish I could be a child again! The memories of my school days dominate my childhood. I was sent to school at six. I studied in a distant primary school named Kanchichora Government Primary school upto class two. Then I was made to take my admission in another school called Mathbari Government Primary School. I used to go to school with my village friends. My cousin who was one year senior to me was my constant school-going companion. In school the classes were not much interesting to me but the leisure period while we used to play various sports. I was a regular student in my class. So I was hardly beaten or scolded (বকাবকি করা) by my teachers for negligence to studies. After the school was over, in our way home, we used to-play ha-du-du, hide and seek, gather plums or steal' green mangoes-from some trees and sometimes used to bath in stream. One day I along with my three friends went to a friend's house to eat green-plum. But as thè tree was long, none of us dared to climb it up. Hence, we had to come back in a dissatisfied mind.\nIn my school I was not a good athlete. Yet I used to take part in various events. Once I got two prizes in race and long-jump and therefore became very excited and happy. The holidays were favourite to me. On holidays I used to play with my friends almost the whole day. Sometimes I would go to some other village for play. I also would visit my nearby relatives on holidays. How happy I was in my childhood days! The happy and pleasant memories of those days still give me pleasure. If I could go back to those days again!"
