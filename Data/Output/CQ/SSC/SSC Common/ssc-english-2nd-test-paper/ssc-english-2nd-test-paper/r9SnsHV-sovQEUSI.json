Recently, the population of mosquitoes in our area has increased significantly, making it difficult for the residents to go about their daily activities. The mosquito menace is particularly severe during the evening and night, causing discomfort, disturbed sleep, and posing a major health threat to people, especially the elderly and children.\nWith the rise in mosquito breeding grounds due to inadequate sanitation and the rainy season, there has been an increase in cases of mosquito-borne diseases, such as dengue and malaria. Residents are also concerned about the spread of such diseases in our community.\nI kindly request you to take immediate steps to combat this mosquito issue. The following measures are suggested:\nRegular fogging and spraying of insecticides throughout the area.\nCleaning of drains and removing any stagnant water to minimize breeding grounds.\nAwareness campaigns for the residents to take preventive actions, such as using mosquito nets and keeping their surroundings clean.\nI trust that your office will take the necessary steps as soon as possible to ensure the safety and well-being of the residents of Ward-12. Thank you for your attention to this pressing matter. I look forward to your swift response and actions.\nSincerely, Rahul [Your Full Name] Resident, Ward-12, Mirpur Contact: [Your Phone Number]"

          "question": "",
          "explanation": "Price Hike\nA price hike refers to a sudden or gradual increase in the cost of goods or services, often triggered by various economic, social, or political factors. It can result from rising production costs, such as higher raw material prices, increased labor wages, or escalating energy expenses. External factors like inflation, supply chain disruptions, and global crises, including natural disasters or geopolitical conflicts, also contribute to price hikes. For businesses, a price hike can be a necessary step to maintain profitability and sustain operations amidst growing expenses. However, for consumers, it often leads to financial strain as they face higher living costs and reduced purchasing power. Essential commodities such as food, fuel, and healthcare services are particularly sensitive to price hikes, disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income households. Governments and policymakers may intervene by implementing subsidies, price controls, or tax reductions to mitigate the impact on vulnerable populations. In some cases, however, such measures are temporary and fail to address the root causes of the problem. On a broader scale, price hikes can alter consumer behavior, leading to reduced demand or a shift towards more affordable alternatives. While businesses may experience short-term gains, sustained price hikes can harm the economy by curbing consumer spending and triggering a slowdown. Effective management of economic policies, alongside innovations in production and supply chain efficiency, is essential to control price hikes and ensure economic stability."

          "explanation": "\n\nWonders of Modern Science\n\nScience means knowledge gained through experiment and research. Science does many things for the development of human civilization. The modern age is a gift of science. We are passing our days under the great influence of science.\n\nWe see the influence of science at every step of our life. It has changed the way we live. It has invented many things for our comfort. Today we feel the presence of science in our everyday life. The pen we write with, the shirt we put on, the bicycle we ride - all are the invention of science. With the touch of a switch, we get our lights dazzling, fans whirling and radios and televisions singing and talking.\n\nThe invention of electricity has brought about a revolutionary change in the history of human civilization. Electricity helps to operate machine, factories and other heavy industries. Electric fans, lights, and heaters have made our life more enjoyable.\n\nMoreover, our agricultural and industrial development is fully dependent on modern science. We now cultivate our land with power tillers. The production of crops is increasing day by day with the help of chemical fertilizers and insecticides. Science also helps us in inyenting new hybrid seeds. In industrial areas, science has made a significant contribution. From needles to rockets, everything produced in industry is the contribution of science.\n\nCommunication is considered the motion of life. Science has brought about a great change in our communication system also: Invention of speedy transports like bus, train, airplane, truck, ship etc. has made transportation faster and comfortable. Rocket and space shuttle are great wonders of modern science. By using them; man has already conquered the moon and is now preparing for the Mars. Besides, satellite television has added a new dimension to our communication system. It has brought the whole world to our living room. Moreover, telephone, FAX, E-mail, cellular phone, and internet have turned the whole world -into a global village. We can instantly communicate with our friends and family through them.\n\nIn the medical field, science has done unbelievable improvements. Blood transfusion and transplantation of other organs have become possible with the help of science. The invention of X-ray, ECG, Ultrasonography, penicillin, CT scan, biopsy, various life-saving antibiotic, etc. has worked wonders in the field of medical science. Modern medical science has given eyes to the blind, hearing to the deaf, legs to the lame and what not. However, the inventions of science could also be destructive also if they are misused."
