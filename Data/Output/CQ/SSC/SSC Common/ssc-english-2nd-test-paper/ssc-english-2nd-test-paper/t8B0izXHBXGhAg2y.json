          "explanation": "A national flag is the symbol of independence and sovereignty of a country. Every free nation of the world has its own national flag. It introduces a country to the whole world. As a free nation, we also have a national flag of our own. We achieved this flag through a bloody. war against the Pakistani military forces in 1971. The shape of our national flag is rectangular. The ratio of its length and width is 10 : 6 10: 6 10 : 6 . It is made of cotton, linen or silk. It bears a combination of two colours. The major part of it is deep green and there is a red circle in the middle of it. The radius of the circle is one-fifth of the length of the flag. Its deep green colour' stands for everlasting youth, freshness and vigour of our nation. It also symbolises the greenery of Bangladesh. On the other hand, the red circle symbolises the rising sun of independence. It also stands for the supreme sacrifices of our heroic freedom fighters, who laid down their lives for thè independence of our motherland. The flag is hoisted every day on the top of the buildings of government semi-government offices and educational institutions. Moreover, it is hoisted everywhere on the Independent Day and the Victory Day. Besides, it is kept half-mast, on our national mourning days. Our national flag is the source of our spirit, hope, and aspiration: So, we must defend our independence at any cost and save the existence and prestige of our national flag."

          "explanation": "There are six seasons in Bangladesh, the land of natural beauty. They are summer, rainy, autumn, late autumn, winter and spring. Every season has its unique features. Of all these seasons I like the spring most.. This season consists of the Bangla months of Falgun and Chaitra. It is the best, the loveliest and the most charming of all the seasons. There are some specific reaons why I like the spring most.\nTo me, the winter is very cold, dull and lifeless. In summer, the scorching sun, hot days and nights make life miserable. The heavy rain and frequent floods in the rainy season bring great sufferings to the people. The autumn and the late autumn have also more or less the disadvantages like the summer, rainy and winter seasons. But the spring has none of the inconveniences of these seasons. Coming after winter, it captivates the hearts of all.\nWith the arrival of the spring, nature puts on a lively look. Everything in the nature looks fresh. The sky looks' clear and blue, trees put forth new leaves, and the flowers of charming colour and scent bloom in trees. Bees and butterflies hum and fly from one flower to another. During this season, gentle breeze begins to blow. Sweet twitters of birds are heard. The melodious notes of the cuckoo please our ears. All these charming and pleasing sights and sounds have a positive influence on our mind. Everywhere there is joy and mirth. People also enjoy a better health. Besides, during this time, various kinds of vegetables and fruits are also available. The season has a few disadvantages, too. During this season, some people suffer from diseases like diarrhoea, cholera, chicken-pox, etc.\nIn spite of its few disadvantages, its positive aspects are overwhelming. The convenience it offers fascinates all. That's why, I like the spring season most."
