As you are aware, the common room is a vital space for students to refresh their minds and engage in recreational activities during breaks. However, the current setup is insufficient to meet the increasing needs of the students.\nThe common room lacks adequate seating arrangements, indoor game facilities, and updated newspapers and magazines. During recess, it becomes overcrowded, leaving many students without the opportunity to utilize the space effectively. This has a negative impact on our relaxation time, which is essential for maintaining focus and productivity in classes.\nWe humbly request your kind intervention to enhance the facilities in the common room by providing more chairs and tables, introducing additional indoor games like carrom and chess, and ensuring a regular supply of updated reading materials. These improvements would greatly contribute to the overall well-being and academic performance of the students.\nWe are hopeful for your understanding and prompt action in this regard.\nThank you for considering our request.\nYours faithfully,\nSumona Akter On behalf of the students Khulna Zilla School"

          "explanation": "Mobile phone is one of the latest inventions of modern science. It is a small cellular phone that can be easily carried with us. It has made our everyday life easygoing and tension free. We can now communicate easily with others through this. As the networks of different mobile operators have covered almost the whole country, we do not have any chance to get lost. Our friends and family members can easily find us no matter how far we stay. Moreover, we can use Internet through mobile phone and communicate with others very easily. Nowadays, it is also used as the alternative to computers because there are many kinds of apps in the latest mobile phones which perform different types of work like sending and receiving e-mail, using social networks, writing and editing documents, capturing photos, etc. Because of its great benefits, the number of mobile phone users is increasing day by day. But every positive thing has some negatives aspects as well. Mobile phone is also not an exception to this. Teenagers often spoil their valuable time by talking to their friends for a long time. They are often found to talk to their friends for long two or three hours at night. Different mobile operators often offer some mid-night free or low cost calls. Students mostly take this advantage and thus kill their time. Besides, hijackers, robbers and different anti-social activists often commit crime by communicating among themselves through mobile phone. Scientists are warning that excessive use of mobile phone can cause brain cancer and hamper the mental growth of children. But despite these disadvantages, we use mobile phone as it has been a part and parcel in our daily life."

          "question": "",
          "explanation": "My hobby is reading books, and it is one of the most cherished and enriching activities I engage in. Since I was young, I’ve been drawn to the world that books open up to readers. Every time I pick up a book, it feels like entering a new universe, one filled with endless possibilities. Whether the book is fiction or non-fiction, reading has always been a way for me to connect with different ideas, cultures, and experiences.\nThe greatest aspect of reading is the way it stimulates my imagination. It enables me to step into the shoes of people from different walks of life, learn about far-off places, and get immersed in stories of courage, triumph, and even despair. Fiction has the magical ability to allow me to explore realms beyond reality—whether it be fantasy worlds filled with magic, futuristic societies, or historical settings that paint a vivid picture of different times. Authors take us through intense journeys, where every plot twist, character’s choice, and unexpected turn adds depth to the narrative. It makes me think critically and helps in improving my ability to see various perspectives.\nApart from fiction, I also enjoy reading non-fiction, particularly books related to history, science, and philosophy. Through these genres, I gather knowledge that not only broadens my worldview but also allows me to engage in insightful discussions. History books take me back in time, shedding light on past civilizations, influential leaders, and pivotal events that shaped the world as we know it. Learning about different cultures and the struggles they’ve faced helps me become more empathetic toward others. Meanwhile, books on science and philosophy push the boundaries of my understanding of the natural world and human existence. I find it exciting to learn how theories and discoveries have advanced over time and how they impact the world today.\nReading is also a great escape for me. In moments of stress or when I feel overwhelmed by life’s demands, opening a book becomes an instant remedy. The immersion in a well-written novel or an intriguing subject allows me to detach from any worries, providing me with much-needed relaxation and mental clarity. Sometimes, a few hours spent lost in a captivating story can completely rejuvenate my spirit, leaving me with new energy and focus.\nOne of my favorite genres is mystery. I find thrillers particularly exciting—books with intricate plots and well-developed characters that challenge my intellect. The thrill of solving a crime or understanding an enigma before the book reveals the solution is both stimulating and rewarding. Mystery books encourage me to think critically, analyze evidence, and weigh possibilities. It’s like becoming part of a detective team in solving a puzzle, and I deeply enjoy this mental challenge.\nOver time, reading has helped me develop many skills. It has improved my vocabulary, enhanced my writing abilities, and has expanded my knowledge base. These improvements have greatly influenced my performance in school and allowed me to express my thoughts clearly in both written and spoken forms. But more importantly, it has cultivated a lifelong love for learning. I realize that with every book, I open myself up to new ideas and perspectives, which shapes my understanding of the world.\nThrough reading, I have learned about perseverance, empathy, critical thinking, and the importance of knowing one’s past. These lessons go beyond the pages of any book and continue to shape my approach to life. Reading is, to me, not just a hobby but a way of growing—mentally, emotionally, and intellectually. Whether it’s in my quiet room or on a bus during my travels, I never leave home without a book. This hobby will always remain close to my heart, and I hope it stays with me for the rest of my life."
