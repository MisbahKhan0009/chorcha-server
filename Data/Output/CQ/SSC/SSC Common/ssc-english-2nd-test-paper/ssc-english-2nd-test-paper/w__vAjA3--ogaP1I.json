As you are aware, the common room is a vital space for students to refresh their minds and engage in recreational activities during breaks. However, the current setup is insufficient to meet the increasing needs of the students.\nThe common room lacks adequate seating arrangements, indoor game facilities, and updated newspapers and magazines. During recess, it becomes overcrowded, leaving many students without the opportunity to utilize the space effectively. This has a negative impact on our relaxation time, which is essential for maintaining focus and productivity in classes.\nWe humbly request your kind intervention to enhance the facilities in the common room by providing more chairs and tables, introducing additional indoor games like carrom and chess, and ensuring a regular supply of updated reading materials. These improvements would greatly contribute to the overall well-being and academic performance of the students.\nWe are hopeful for your understanding and prompt action in this regard.\nThank you for considering our request.\nYours faithfully,\nSumona Akter On behalf of the students Khulna Zilla School"

If there is no cloud and the sky is clear, the night becomes bright. A moonlit night can be best enjoyed from any village where there is no light of electricity or any other source. The main attractions of a moonlit night are the merriment of children, gossiping of young people, singing of women and telling stories of the old. Another attraction is travelling by boat. During the moonlit night the moon looks like a dise of gold. The moon plays hide and seek behind the clouds. Twinkling stars surround the moon to make the sky a fairy land. The birds come out of their nests. The animals leave their fold and move around. The water of seas, rivers, canals, ponds and lakes reflect the moon light to create a beautiful effect. It is a night of beauty and joy. So, I like a moonlit night and enjoy it very much."

          "explanation": "My Favourite Hobby\nHobby means one's favourite pastime. Usually, hobby is not meant to support someone financially, but a way to derive pleasure out of it. Without it, life becomes dull and monotonous.\nDifferent people have different hobbies. Some choose gardening, some like drawing picture; on the other hand, some may like rearing birds or catching fish, collecting stamps and so on. But whatever is the hobby, it has its own uniqueness and one chooses his or her hobby on the basis of what he or she enjoys most. My favourite hobby is gardening.\nActually, I love flowers very much. So, I have made a flower garden. It is in front of our house. I have planted the seedlings of roses, jasmine, sunflower, China rose, cosmos, marigold, beli, etc in my garden.\nIn a comer of the garden, I also grow some seasonal vegetables. I have put a strong bamboo-made fence around my garden. So, cattle or other animals cannot enter the garden and do any harm to the plants.\nMoreover, my garden is a great source of passing my leisure time. Every day, I work in my garden for some time. In the morning, I water the plants, make the soil loose and weed out the grasses. In the evening, I water the plants again. On holidays, I pass some time there too.\nI truly love my hobby; it keeps me happy and cheerful. When I get bored with my studies or other works, I go to my garden. The pleasant sight of the garden and the sweet fragrance of the flowers remove my boredom. It is a great source of joy and recreation for me. When various colourful flowers bloom, my garden looks like a paradise. Most importantly, my hobby never hampers my study.\nMy hobby is very beneficial to me. Before I made the garden, I used to feel sick all the time. I lost my appetite and became very weak. But when I started working in my garden, my health began to improve. Besides, the vegetables in my garden also provide nutrition to our family and in the way save some money for my parents.\nIn conclusion, a hobby is necessary for all of us. But we must not spend too much time in pursuit of our hobby. We must perform our main tasks first and then we should spend our leisure time pursuing our hobby.\n"
