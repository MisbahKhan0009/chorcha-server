As the world is becoming increasingly interconnected, the importance of mastering various languages has never been greater. A language club would not only enhance our communication skills but also allow us to explore diverse cultures and broaden our horizons.\nThrough a language club, students could participate in activities such as language workshops, debates, quizzes, and cultural exchange programs. Such initiatives would help improve fluency in languages like English, Bangla, and even foreign languages such as French, German, or Chinese. Moreover, it would provide an opportunity to develop confidence in public speaking, presentation, and creative writing.\nWe believe that the presence of a language club would be an asset to our school. It could inspire students to engage in academic excellence while also building a bridge to global learning opportunities. We are confident that under your guidance, the language club will thrive and positively impact the academic environment of our school.\nTherefore, we kindly request you to consider our proposal and take the necessary steps to establish a language club. We are willing to offer our cooperation to make this initiative successful.\nThank you for your attention and understanding.\nYours sincerely, Samin Class Ten [Date]"

          "question": "",
          "explanation": "My hobby is reading books, and it is one of the most cherished and enriching activities I engage in. Since I was young, I’ve been drawn to the world that books open up to readers. Every time I pick up a book, it feels like entering a new universe, one filled with endless possibilities. Whether the book is fiction or non-fiction, reading has always been a way for me to connect with different ideas, cultures, and experiences.\nThe greatest aspect of reading is the way it stimulates my imagination. It enables me to step into the shoes of people from different walks of life, learn about far-off places, and get immersed in stories of courage, triumph, and even despair. Fiction has the magical ability to allow me to explore realms beyond reality—whether it be fantasy worlds filled with magic, futuristic societies, or historical settings that paint a vivid picture of different times. Authors take us through intense journeys, where every plot twist, character’s choice, and unexpected turn adds depth to the narrative. It makes me think critically and helps in improving my ability to see various perspectives.\nApart from fiction, I also enjoy reading non-fiction, particularly books related to history, science, and philosophy. Through these genres, I gather knowledge that not only broadens my worldview but also allows me to engage in insightful discussions. History books take me back in time, shedding light on past civilizations, influential leaders, and pivotal events that shaped the world as we know it. Learning about different cultures and the struggles they’ve faced helps me become more empathetic toward others. Meanwhile, books on science and philosophy push the boundaries of my understanding of the natural world and human existence. I find it exciting to learn how theories and discoveries have advanced over time and how they impact the world today.\nReading is also a great escape for me. In moments of stress or when I feel overwhelmed by life’s demands, opening a book becomes an instant remedy. The immersion in a well-written novel or an intriguing subject allows me to detach from any worries, providing me with much-needed relaxation and mental clarity. Sometimes, a few hours spent lost in a captivating story can completely rejuvenate my spirit, leaving me with new energy and focus.\nOne of my favorite genres is mystery. I find thrillers particularly exciting—books with intricate plots and well-developed characters that challenge my intellect. The thrill of solving a crime or understanding an enigma before the book reveals the solution is both stimulating and rewarding. Mystery books encourage me to think critically, analyze evidence, and weigh possibilities. It’s like becoming part of a detective team in solving a puzzle, and I deeply enjoy this mental challenge.\nOver time, reading has helped me develop many skills. It has improved my vocabulary, enhanced my writing abilities, and has expanded my knowledge base. These improvements have greatly influenced my performance in school and allowed me to express my thoughts clearly in both written and spoken forms. But more importantly, it has cultivated a lifelong love for learning. I realize that with every book, I open myself up to new ideas and perspectives, which shapes my understanding of the world.\nThrough reading, I have learned about perseverance, empathy, critical thinking, and the importance of knowing one’s past. These lessons go beyond the pages of any book and continue to shape my approach to life. Reading is, to me, not just a hobby but a way of growing—mentally, emotionally, and intellectually. Whether it’s in my quiet room or on a bus during my travels, I never leave home without a book. This hobby will always remain close to my heart, and I hope it stays with me for the rest of my life."
