          "question": "",
          "explanation": "Load-shedding is a recurring issue in our daily lives, particularly in countries with inadequate power generation or poor infrastructure. It refers to the deliberate interruption of electricity supply to manage demand when it exceeds the available supply. While it may be necessary to prevent overloading the system, its impact on everyday life is profound and disruptive. Load-shedding paralyzes various aspects of our routines. Students, for instance, suffer immensely as they are forced to study in dim light or suspend their studies altogether. Businesses and industries also bear the brunt, as factories cannot operate machinery, resulting in reduced productivity and financial losses. Moreover, households face numerous inconveniences, such as disrupted cooking, lack of access to clean water due to non-functional pumps, and discomfort during extreme weather conditions when fans or air conditioners cease to work. Health services are another critical area affected; hospitals often face challenges running essential equipment, putting patients' lives at risk. Small vendors and shopkeepers lose sales as customers prefer well-lit areas to shop. Load-shedding also affects public safety since prolonged power outages can lead to an increase in theft and other crimes in poorly lit areas. The problem stems from insufficient power generation, high electricity demand, and technical faults in the grid system. While using alternative energy sources like solar panels, generators, and UPS systems provides temporary relief, a sustainable solution requires significant investment in infrastructure and renewable energy. Until then, load-shedding will remain a pressing challenge, disrupting progress and daily life."

          "explanation": "Science means knowledge gained through experiment and research. Science does many things for the development of human civilization. The modern age is a gift of science. We are passing our days under the great influence of science.\nWe see the influence of science at every step of our life. It has changed the way we live. It has invented many things for our comfort. Today we feel the presence of science in our everyday life. The pen we write with, the shirt we put on, the bicycle we ride all are the invention of science. With the touch of a switch, we get our lights dazzling, fans whirling and radios and televisions singing and talking.\nThe invention of electricity has brought about a revolutionary change in the history of human civilization. Electricity helps to operate machine, factories and other heavy industries. Electric fans, lights, and heaters have made our life more enjoyable.\nMoreover, our agricultural and industrial development is fully dependent on modern science. We now cultivate our land with power tillers. The production of crops is increasing day by day with the help of chemical fertilizers and insecticides. Science also helps us in inventing new hybrid seeds. In industrial areas, science has made a significant contribution. From needles to rockets, everything produced in industry is the contribution of science.\nCommunication is considered the motion of life. Science has brought about a great change in our communication system also. Invention of speedy transports like bus, train, airplane, truck, ship etc. has made transportation faster and comfortable. Rocket and space shuttle are great wonders of modern science. By using them, man has already conquered the moon and is now preparing for the Mars. Besides, satellite television has added a new dimension to our communication system. It has brought the whole world to our living room. Moreover, telephone, FAX, E-mail, cellular phone, and internet have turned the whole world into a global village. We can instantly communicate with our friends and family through them.\nIn the medical field, science has done unbelievable improvements. Blood transfusion and transplantation of other organs have become possible with the help of science. The invention of X-ray, ECG, Ultrasonography, penicillin, CT scan, biopsy, various life-saving antibiotic, etc. has worked wonders in the field of medical science. Modern medical science has given eyes to the blind, hearing to the deaf, legs to the lame and what not.\nHowever, the inventions of science could also be destructive also if they are misused. By inventing atom bomb, hydrogen bomb, missiles, and other explosives, men are now destroying the human race and its beautiful creation in the world. The destruction caused by dropping atom bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II bears testimony to it.\nIn conclusion, the wonders of science cannot be described in words. But if it is misused, it brings destruction. So, it should be utilised for the greater benefit of human beings."
