          "explanation": "The Life of a Farmer\nA farmer is the person, who cultivates lands and grows different types of crops to earn his bread. Generally, a farmer is a poor man and lives in the village. In Bangladesh, the life of a farmer is pitiable. Most of the farmers have no land of their own. So. most of the time he is to cultivate the land of others. Usually, a farmer is an illiterate person. He does not know how to plough his land scientifically. He cannot apply scientific method. He has only a pair of bullocks and some hand-made tools. Often he does not have enough money to buy seeds, fertilizer or pesticide. As a result, he cannot produce more food for himself and his family. He lives from hand to mouth. He also has pleasures and pains in life. If he gets a good harvest, his face beams with joy. On the other hand, if the harvest is not good, his sorrows know no bounds. He works very hard to prepare the land for planting or sowing crops. As the farmers grow and reap the harvest, we have our food. By working hard in the field, he grows a bumper crop which helps develop our national economy. We know that ours is an agricultural country. More than 80 percent people are directly or indirectly engaged in agriculture. Our economy is also mostly dependent on agriculture. So, to promote the development of national economy, the farmers should be helped with agricultural subsidies by the government. They should be encouraged to use tractors instead of the age-old ploughs. They should also be taught to use the modern cultivation methods. This is how, the life of a farmer can be developed."

          "explanation": "The Season I Like Most\nThere are six seasons in Bangladesh, the land of natural beauty. They are summer, rainy, autumn, late autumn, winter and spring. Every season has its unique features. Of all these seasons I likė the spring most. This season consists of the Bangla months of Falgun and Chaitra. It is the best, the loveliest and the most charming of all the seasons. There are some specific reaons why I like the spring most. To me, the winter is very cold, dull and lifeless. In summer, the scorching sun, hot days and nights make life miserable.. The heavy rain and frequent floods in the rainy season bring great sufferings to the people. The autumn and the late autumn have also more or less the disadvantages like the summer, rainy and winter seasons. But the spring has none of the inconveniences of these seasons. Coming after winter, it captivates the hearts of all.\nWith the arrival of the spring, nature puts on a lively look. Everything in the nature looks fresh. The sky looks clear and blue, trees put forth new leaves, and the flowers of charming colour and scent bloom in trees. Bees and butterflies hum and fly from one flower to another. During this season, gentle breeze begins to blow. Sweet twitters of birds are heard. The melodious notes of the cuckoo please our ears. All these charming and pleasing sights and sounds have a positive influence on our mind. Everywhere there is joy and mirth. People also enjoy a better health. Besides, during this time, various kinds of vegetables and fruits are also available.\nThe season has a few disadvantages, too. During this season, some people suffer from diseases like diarrhoea, cholera, chicken-pox, etc. In spite of its few disadvantages, its positive aspects are overwhelming..The convenience it offers fascinates all. That's why, I like the spring season most."
