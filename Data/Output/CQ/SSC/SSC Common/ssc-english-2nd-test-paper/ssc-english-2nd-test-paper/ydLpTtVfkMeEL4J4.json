I am Arif/Arifa, a student of your esteemed institution. I am writing to bring to your attention the current condition of our school library, which, despite its potential to be a great resource for students, is falling short in certain areas.\nThe library is indeed spacious and holds a prominent place in our school. However, the collection of books is quite limited and outdated. It does not adequately cater to the diverse academic and extracurricular needs of the students. Additionally, the sitting arrangements in the library are insufficient and not conducive to effective study sessions.\nA well-equipped and comfortable library is essential for fostering a culture of reading and learning among students. Therefore, I kindly request that you look into this matter and take the necessary steps to enhance the book collection and improve the seating arrangements.\nI am confident that your intervention will greatly benefit the students and contribute positively to our academic environment.\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your kind consideration.\nSincerely,\nArif/Arifa (Student)"
