Constant supply of electricity ensures the smooth function of daily activities in all spheres of life. But the failure of electricity at present has become a matter of concern to us. Normal life comes to a halt for load-shedding. It is a bitter truth that acute shortage in the supply of electricity is incurring a big loss in all social and economic institutions across the country. The supply of elèctricity is also very negligible in our locality. Students cannot retain their study frequently in this situation and are going through a new crisis in the face of the upcoming SSC examination. They are in a helpless situation. Load-shedding has, intensified sufferings in the health complexes too, facing problems in providing smooth services especially in operation theatre and ICU. In addition to this, the production at the sugar mills has severely declined due to it. The people are now passing a very critical moment for this. The problems have frequently been brought to the attention of the local authority, which actually produced no result. Measures must be taken immediately to minimize the problem for the overall welfare of the locality and the people living here. To conclude, we do hope authority will take all urgent steps for the greater interest of the people without any delay."
