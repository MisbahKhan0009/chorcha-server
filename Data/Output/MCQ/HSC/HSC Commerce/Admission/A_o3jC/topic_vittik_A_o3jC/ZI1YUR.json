      "explanation": "সঠিক উত্তরটি হলো ঘ: The boy said to the teacher, \"Sir, may I go home.\" ব্যাখ্যা ও গঠন (Explanation and Structure): প্রদত্ত বাক্যটি Indirect Speech -এ আছে। এর Direct Speech করার নিয়ম নিচে আলোচনা করা হলো: ১. Reporting Verb: Indirect-এ 'requested' থাকলে Direct-এ সাধারণত 'said to' বসে। শিক্ষক বা বড় কাউকে অনুরোধ করলে সম্মানের খাতিরে উদ্ধৃতি চিহ্নের ভেতর 'Sir' শব্দটি ব্যবহার করা হয়। ২. Might be allowed to: Indirect-এ যখন 'might be allowed to' থাকে, তখন Direct Speech-এ সেটি সাধারণত 'May I' দিয়ে শুরু হওয়া একটি প্রশ্নবোধক বাক্য হয় (অনুমতি চাওয়ার ক্ষেত্রে) [২০২৫ সালের ইংরেজি ব্যাকরণ নিয়ম অনুযায়ী]। ৩. Person Change: Indirect-এর 'he' (the boy) Direct-এ 'I' হয়ে যাবে, কারণ ছেলেটি সরাসরি নিজের কথা বলছে। গঠন বিশ্লেষণ: Indirect: The boy requested the teacher (Reporting verb) + that (Linker) + he might be allowed to go home (Permission structure). Direct: The boy said to the teacher, \"Sir, may I go home?\" (এখানে 'Sir' দ্বারা 'requested' ভাবটি প্রকাশ পেয়েছে এবং 'may I' দ্বারা অনুমতি চাওয়া হয়েছে)।"
