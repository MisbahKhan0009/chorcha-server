      "question": "Dear Editor, I have just learned that our town's public art museum will eliminate Saturday hours next month due to a protracted budget shortfall. Although the continued shortfall necessitates some cuts in town programs or services, Saturday museum hours are simply too important to lose. It will be a severe hardship and loss to our town's citizens and the museum doses on Saturdays. For many working people like myself, Saturday is the only day of the week we have to take advantage of the breathtaking and thought-provoking art work our museum has to offer. Parents often use this day to take their children to the museum in order to expose them to this important bit of culture. The public museum has been a boon to this town since it opened in 1975. It has fostered an interest in the arts, increased cultural awareness, and had a positive impact on the local economy. Even people from many nearby towns choose Saturday - a day free from obligation - to come and see artwork here. This is no frivolous matter; efforts made In this direction would be well spent. The increase of - for all intents and purposes - a nearly Inconsequential amount to the homeowner tax bill would suffice to keep the museum open. Isn't our museum worth it? I beseech everyone who values our museum to contact his or her town representative and ask for funding to keep the Saturday museum hours intact. Sincerely, Maria B. Williams Which best describes the tone of the author of this letter?",
