      "question": "Read the passage carefully and answer Questions: Green Tech is a term which describes the use of science and technology to develop eco-friendly products and services that protect our environment. It includes renewable energy, sustainable transportation, waste management and recycling, energy efficiency solutions, all helping the world to move towards a more sustainable future. Concepts and solutions that transcend beyond environmental technologies are known as green technologies. The term \"green\" has been defined as the union of sustainable and friendly under the contexts of environment, economy, societies and technologies. In relation to communications and computing, the term \"green\" can be traced back to establishment of the IEEE Technical Subcommittee on Green Communications and Computing (TSCGCC) one year after 2010. Green technologies are now more aligned to the approaches towards achieving sustainability and meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDGs were proposed in 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) as part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and as replacement of global development framework called Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) proposed in 2000. Green technologies are not just a collection of isolated technologies. The entire world is facing several significant challenges in multiple sectors, such as extreme climate changes, energy and resource depletions, and global impacts of diseases, extensive environmental pollution, and serious food crises, which demand the need for various interdisciplinary green technologies. The future of sustainable development will depend on practical green solutions for extensive areas, which promote the development of green technologies. Green technologies will help create new relationships between humans, nature as well as the new world. 1.1. What are green technologies?",
