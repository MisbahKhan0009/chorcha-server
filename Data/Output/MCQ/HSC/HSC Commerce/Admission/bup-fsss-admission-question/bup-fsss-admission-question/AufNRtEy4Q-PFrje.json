      "option_c": "to be visiting",
      "option_d": "that she will visit",
      "correct": "খ",
      "explanation": "Out of the options, the most grammatically correct and natural way to complete the sentence is: The Queen is set to visit Australia next year. Here's why: \"To visit\" is the infinitive form of the verb \"visit\" and is often used after modal verbs like \"set\" to express future intention. \"To have visited\" would imply the visit has already happened, which is not the case. \"To be visiting\" is grammatically incorrect in this context because the continuous tense doesn't fit the planned nature of the visit. \"That she will visit\" is slightly awkward and less concise than the infinitive form. Therefore, \"The Queen is set to visit Australia next year\" is the most accurate and natural way to express the potential future visit of the Queen to Australia."

      "correct": "ক",
      "explanation": "The phrase \"a fish out of water\" means feeling uneasy or uncomfortable in a particular situation. Here's an explanation of the options: Uneasy: This is an appropriate interpretation. When someone feels like a fish out of water, they often feel uneasy or out of place. Frustrated: While frustration could be a secondary emotion resulting from feeling out of place, it may not capture the primary sense of being like a fish out of water. Bored: The phrase doesn't directly convey boredom. It's more about discomfort and not fitting into a particular environment. Unnatural: This could be an interpretation but uneasy is the more direct and correct interpretation. In summary, the most fitting interpretation is \"uneasy,\" as it directly aligns with the feeling of being out of place or uncomfortable."

Rule for future perfect tense: It is formed using the future tense of the auxiliary verb \"will\" or \"shall,\" the word \"have,\" and the past participle of the main verb. 3. Correct sentence analysis: - \"The film\" is the subject of the sentence. - \"will already have started\" is the future perfect verb phrase. - \"will\" is the future tense auxiliary verb. - \"already\" indicates that the action will be completed before a certain time. - \"have\" is the auxiliary verb indicating completion. - \"started\" is the past participle of the main verb \"start.\" 4. Incorrect options: - \"will already start\": This option lacks the completion aspect provided by the future perfect tense. - \"will already be started\": While grammatically correct, it doesn't express the perfect aspect of completion that \"will already have started\" does. So, the rule involves using the future perfect tense to express actions that will be completed before a specified point in the future."
