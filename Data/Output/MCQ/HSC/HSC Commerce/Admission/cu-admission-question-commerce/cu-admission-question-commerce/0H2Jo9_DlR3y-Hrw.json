      "option_d": "the reading of the book interested many people",
      "correct": "গ",
      "explanation": "The correct answer is \"many people wanted to read the book.\" Let's analyze why this is the best choice and why the other options are less suitable: The book was read by many people : This option uses the passive voice (\"was read\"), which makes it less direct and engaging than an active voice construction. It also doesn't clearly link the cause (seeing the movie) to the effect (people reading the book). The book made many people want to read it : This option is somewhat awkward and repetitive. It personifies the book by suggesting it had the agency to make people want to read it, which is a less natural way of expressing the idea. Many people wanted to read the book : This is the best option. It's straightforward, uses active voice, and clearly links the action of seeing the movie with the desire to read the book. The reading of the book interested many people : This choice is also a bit awkward. It unnecessarily nominalizes the verb \"read\" into \"the reading,\" which makes the sentence more complex and less direct. It also doesn't make the cause-effect relationship as clear as option 3. So, \"After seeing the movie, many people wanted to read the book\" is the most clear and direct way of expressing the idea that the movie inspired an interest in reading the book."

      "explanation": "The correct phrase to use in this context is \"fill out.\" The sentence should be: “If you want to join our club, you have to fill out a form and send it to the secretary.” In English, \" fill out \" is a phrasal verb commonly used to mean completing the necessary information on a form or document. It's the standard phrase used in contexts where one is required to provide details in the fields of a form. The other options are not typically used in this context: fill up though generally used, it means to make something full, such as filling up a gas tank or a glass of water, not a document. fill into is not a standard phrasal verb in English and doesn't fit in this context. fill over is also not a common or appropriate phrase for completing forms."
