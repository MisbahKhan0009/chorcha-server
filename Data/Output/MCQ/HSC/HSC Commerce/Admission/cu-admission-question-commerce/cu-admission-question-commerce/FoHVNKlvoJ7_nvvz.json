      "explanation": "The sentence describes a situation in the past : “were challenging at first” → past tense “eventually” → indicates what happened later in that same past time frame Therefore, the verb should also be in the simple past tense . Why the other options are incorrect: খ) would adapt This is conditional or habitual future-in-the-past. There is no condition or repeated action implied here. গ) had adapted Past perfect is used when one past action happened before another past action . No such sequence is required here. ঘ) adapt This is the base form (present tense), which does not agree with the past context of the sentence."

      "correct": "খ",
      "explanation": "The sentence describes a laptop purchased before another past reference point ( already having technical issues ). To indicate that one past action ( buying the laptop ) happened before another past action ( it having issues ), we use the past perfect tense : had bought . Why the other options are incorrect: ক) that he bought → simple past; could work in casual speech but does not clearly indicate the earlier past action . গ) that he buy → incorrect verb form; present tense, ungrammatical here. ঘ) he bought → grammatically incomplete as a relative clause; needs “that” . Final sentence: The laptop that he had bought last semester is already having technical problems."

      "option_c": "submitted",
      "option_d": "would submit",
      "correct": "গ",
      "explanation": "Explanation: The subject “Neither of the students” is singular , so it takes a singular verb form . The action refers to a past event (before the deadline), so the simple past tense is appropriate. Correct sentence: Neither of the students submitted their assignment before the deadline despite multiple reminders. Why the other options are incorrect: ক) submit → Base form; incorrect for past tense context. খ) had submitted → Past perfect is unnecessary unless another past action is specified as occurring after this one. ঘ) would submit → Conditional/future; does not fit the past context. Note: Although “students” is plural, the phrase “neither of” makes the subject singular, so submitted is correct."

      "option_c": "took",
      "option_d": "will take",
      "correct": "গ",
      "explanation": "The phrase “It is high time” is followed by a past tense verb to express a present or future necessity or urgency . This is a special usage called the subjunctive mood in English . So: It is high time students took mental health seriously… ✔ Why the other options are incorrect: ক) take → Present tense; not correct after “It is high time” খ) should take → Grammatically possible but not standard in this formal subjunctive construction ঘ) will take → Future tense; does not fit the “high time” expression Final sentence: It is high time students took mental health seriously and sought counseling when needed."

      "option_d": "No sooner they had arrived at the conference venue then",
      "correct": "ক",
      "explanation": "Explanation: In English, “No sooner…than” is a construction used to indicate that one event happens immediately after another. After “No sooner” , we use inversion (auxiliary before the subject) and “than” , not “then”. So the correct structure is: No sooner + had + subject + past participle + than + … Why the other options are incorrect: খ) No sooner they arrived… than → missing inversion ( should be “had they arrived” ) গ) No sooner had they arrived… then → wrong connector; must be than , not then ঘ) No sooner they had arrived… then → both wrong; missing inversion and wrong connector Final sentence: No sooner had they arrived at the conference venue than they realized their presentation file had been misplaced."

      "explanation": "This is a third conditional sentence with a present result (mixed conditional): If + past perfect → If you had eaten a good breakfast Result in the present → you wouldn’t be so hungry now Why the other options are incorrect: খ) can’t be Expresses present certainty, not a hypothetical result of a past condition. গ) won’t be Refers to the future, which does not match “now.” ঘ) would be Grammatically possible, but logically incorrect because eating a good breakfast would prevent hunger, not cause it. Final sentence: If you had eaten a good breakfast, you wouldn’t be so hungry now."

      "explanation": "The sentence says: “------ of the donors was willing to increase their donations and charity went broke.” The context indicates that no donor was willing , which explains why the charity failed. None fits logically and grammatically: None of the donors was willing… ✅ Why the other options are incorrect: ক) Each → Implies every donor was willing → contradicts “charity went broke.” খ) Both → Implies only two donors, also willing → contradicts context. গ) Many → Implies several donors were willing → again, contradicts the charity going broke. Final sentence: None of the donors was willing to increase their donations and charity went broke."

To express an action that was ongoing before another past action , we use the past perfect continuous tense . So: they had been working for over two hours ✔ Why the other options are incorrect: ক) work Present tense; does not fit a past narrative. খ) worked Simple past; does not emphasize the duration and continuity before arrival. ঘ) was working Past continuous, but it describes an action happening at a specific past time, not one that started earlier and continued up to that time.

A dictum has no financial or accounting-specific meaning. খ) a list of precedence This relates to ranking or order of importance. A dictum is a single statement or saying, not a list or hierarchy. গ) a feeling of hatred This describes an emotion (such as hatred or hostility ). A dictum is verbal or written in nature, not an emotional state."

Citics now accommodate over half of the global population, driving economic growth, technological innovation, and cultural exchange. However, rapid urban expansion often leads to environmental degradation, social inequality, and inadequate infrastructure. Air pollution, traffic congestion, and loss of green spaces are persistent challenges. Urban planners are increasingly adopting sustainable practices, such as green buildings, renewable energy integration, and efficient public transportation systems, to mitigate these effects. Social policies aimed at affordable housing, education, and healthcare are also essential for equitable urban development.
