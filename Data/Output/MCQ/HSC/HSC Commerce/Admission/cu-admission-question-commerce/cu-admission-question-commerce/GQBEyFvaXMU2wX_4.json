The use of \"than\" after \"times\" is not appropriate in this context. \"Three times then I\" - This option incorrectly uses \"then,\" which is an adverb of time, instead of \"than,\" which is used for comparison. \"Thrice than I\" - Similar to option 1, the use of \"than\" is inappropriate here. \"Thrice\" means \"three times,\" but it should be followed by \"as much as\" for correct comparison. \"Thrice as much as I\" - This is the correct option. It properly uses \"as much as\" for comparison, indicating that the cousin's earnings are three times the amount of the speaker's earnings."
