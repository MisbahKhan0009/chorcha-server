Feeding their fast-growing populations is one of the biggest challenges for most countries in Africa and Asia. Scientists, agricultural experts, and planners have to discover new ways to produce more food. One possible way is to bring more land under cultivation. This can be done only in places where there is a lot of land not used for agriculture. In many countries, however, arable land is scarce and whatever is available is needed for other purposes- for example, expanding cities and setting up industries. A second way is to make use of new types of seeds to produce more food. Already a number of new strains of paddy and wheat have been developed in different parts of the world..
