More children as well as adults get their vaccinations when the shots are coordinated and given by nurses instead of doctors, a new research suggests, According to the researcher, \"The family physician has all of the responsibility to look after the patient, and so a child with cholera, for example, comes in and the physician's first concern is the test for cholera bacteria, medical checkup and pretty soon, the time for the visit is up. But for a nurse in the primary care setting, vaccinations and other preventive care might be the first thing they're responsible for.\" The researchers found that changing who performs vaccinations was one of the most successful vaccination-promoting strategies, apart from with calls and texts to the general populace reminding them about the shots.
