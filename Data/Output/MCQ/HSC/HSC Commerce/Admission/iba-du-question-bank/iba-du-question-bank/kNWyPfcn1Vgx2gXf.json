      "question": "During the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Communist Party in many countries adopted a strategy known as the Third Period , characterized by a highly radical stance. Party leaders emphasized the imminent collapse of capitalism and the need for an immediate workers’ revolution. They were often critical of social democrats and liberal organizations, labeling them as obstacles to true socialist transformation. By the mid-1930s, however, the global political context shifted with the rise of fascism in Europe. In response, Communist Parties adopted the Popular Front strategy, seeking alliances with a broader spectrum of political and social groups, including liberals, trade unionists, and anti-fascist organizations. The focus during the Popular Front era was less on immediate revolutionary action and more on building coalitions, gradual reforms, and united resistance against fascist threats. The contrast between the Third Period and the Popular Front illustrates how political strategies may shift dramatically in response to changing social and international conditions, from radical confrontation to cooperative engagement. Based on the passage, which one of the following statements is more likely to have been made by a Communist Party organizer during the Third Period than during the Popular Front?",

      "explanation": "Explanation: Third Period (1928–1935): Communist parties pursued a radical, revolutionary line . Saw social democrats, liberals, and non-communists as enemies. Emphasized immediate workers’ revolution . Popular Front (mid-1930s onward): Communist parties worked with broader coalitions (liberals, anti-fascists). Focus on gradual reforms and alliances. African Americans and whites must join together under communism → Popular Front style (coalition) ❌ Workers everywhere must revolt to bring about the final global victory over capitalist oppression → Radical revolutionary rhetoric → Third Period style ✅ African Americans should strive to overcome racism in government → reformist / coalition → Popular Front ❌ Communism aligns with liberal causes → Popular Front ❌ Don’t expect too much progress too quickly → reformist / gradualism → Popular Front ❌ Correct Option: খ — Workers everywhere must revolt to bring about the final global victory over capitalist oppression"

It is given the area of the bordered region is 144 square inches It is given that the length of the photograph is 10 inches and the breadth of the photograph is 8 inches. So, the area of the photograph will be equal to the product of length and breadth, i.e., 10 × 8 10 \\times 8 10 × 8 which will be equal to 80 squareinches. If we need to find the area of the photograph with border, then we have add 2 x 2 x 2 x in the length and breadth of the photograph, because the width has to be considered for both sides. So, the length of the photograph with the border will be 10 + 2 x 10+2 x 10 + 2 x and the breadth of the photograph with the border will be 8 + 2 x 8+2 x 8 + 2 x Therefore, the area of photograph with border will be product of length and breadth, i.e., ( 10 + 2 x ) ( 8 + 2 x ) (10+2 x)(8+2 x) ( 10 + 2 x ) ( 8 + 2 x ) which will be equal to ( 10 + 2 x ) ( 8 + 2 x ) = 80 + 20 x + 16 x + 4 x 2 = 4 x 2 + 36 x + 80 (10+2 x)(8+2 x)=80+20 x+16 x+4 x^{2}=4 x^{2}+36 x+80 ( 10 + 2 x ) ( 8 + 2 x ) = 80 + 20 x + 16 x + 4 x 2 = 4 x 2 + 36 x + 80 Again, it is given in the question that the area of the border is 144 square inches. To find the area of the border we need to subtract the area of the photograph with a photograph with border. Therefore, Area of photograph with border - Area of photograph = 144 =144 = 144 Now, 4 x 2 + 36 x + 80 − 80 = 144 4 x^{2}+36 x+80-80=144 4 x 2 + 36 x + 80 − 80 = 144 Which gives us x = 3 \\mathrm{x}=3 x = 3"

Finally, for (a+c)/(b+d) = a/b + c/d, you can clearly prove this wrong by taking a,b,c,d as 1,2,3,4. Because, 1 2 < 3 4 \\frac{1}{2}<\\frac{3}{4} 2 1 ​ < 4 3 ​ LHS, for ( a + c ) / ( b + d ) = 1 + 3 2 + 4 = 2 3 (a+c) /(b+d)=\\frac{1+3}{2+4}=\\frac{2}{3} ( a + c ) / ( b + d ) = 2 + 4 1 + 3 ​ = 3 2 ​ RHS, for a / b + c / d = , 1 2 + 3 4 = 5 4 \\mathrm{a} / \\mathrm{b}+\\mathrm{c} / \\mathrm{d}=, \\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{3}{4}=\\frac{5}{4} a / b + c / d = , 2 1 ​ + 4 3 ​ = 4 5 ​ So this is also not true.

      "explanation": "'Mimic the reasoning' questions are a bit harder than others. You first need to figure out the reasoning of the argument and then try to figure out the logic used in each of the options. It helps to put the logic in A and B format. Jordan: If a business invests the money necessary to implement ecologically sound practices, its market share will decrease. But if it doesn't implement these practices, it pollutes the environment and wastes resources. Jordan: If A does X, something bad will happen to A. If A doesn't do X, something bad will happen to B. Terry: But if consumers demand environmental responsibility of all businesses, no particular business will be especially hurt. Terry: If C does D, A doing X will not be bad. Now this is the logic used by the argument: Jordan: If A does X, something bad will happen to A. If A doesn't do X, something bad will happen to B. Terry: If C does Y, A doing X will not be bad. (A) Jordan: Either it will rain and our plans for a picnic will be thwarted, or it won't rain and the garden will go yet another day without much-needed watering. Terry: But if it doesn't rain, we can buy a hose and water the garden with the hose. Jordan: If it rains, something bad will happen to us. If it doesn't rain something bad will happen to garden. Terry: If we do X, raining will not be bad. That logic does parallel our original logic. (B) Jordan: Each person can have either an enjoyable life or a long life, for one must eat vegetables and exercise continuously to stay healthy. Terry: That's not true: there are many happy health- conscious people. Jordan: One can get only one thing at a time A or B. Terry: No, both can be had together. (C) Jordan: If taxes are raised, many social problems could be solved, but if they're lowered, the economy will grow again. So, we can't have both social reform and a growing economy. Terry: But if taxes remain at their current level, neither social problems nor the economy will get worse. Jordan: If A does X, good things will happen. If A does opposite of X, other good things will happen. So, both good things cannot happen simultaneously. Terry: If nothing is done, no bad thing will happen. (D) Jordan: If we remodel the kitchen, the house will be more valuable, but even if we do, there's no guarantee that we'll actually get more for the house when we sell it. Terry: But if we don't remodel the kitchen, we might get even less for the house than we paid for it. Jordan: If we do X, a good thing will happen but no guarantee about another good thing. Terry: If we do not do X, a bad thing may happen. (E) Jordan: If the dam's spillway is opened, the river might flood the eastern part of town, but if the spillway is not opened, the dam might burst. Terry: There's no real danger of the dam's bursting, but if we get more heavy rain, opening the spillway is the most prudent policy. Jordan: If X happens, a bad thing may happen but if X doesn't happen, another bad thing may happen. Terry: Chances of the other bad thing are low. Doing X may be most prudent.

The author then prefaces the argument with, \"If this were the only rule one followed..\" (And that rule is, \"never change that set, except by rejecting a belief when given adequate evidence against it.\"). Therefore, the author's argument is only concerned with what would happen if that were the only rule one followed (i.e. if one were to only remove beliefs and never add new beliefs). If someone were to \"accept new beliefs when presented with some kinds of evidence\" (as stated in choice B), then that person would NOT be adhering only to that rule (since they would be ADDING to the set of beliefs). So, the author does not neglect the \"possibility that even while following the statisticians' rule, one might also accept new beliefs when presented with some kinds of evidence\"; rather, the author specifically states that the argument does not apply in those situations.
