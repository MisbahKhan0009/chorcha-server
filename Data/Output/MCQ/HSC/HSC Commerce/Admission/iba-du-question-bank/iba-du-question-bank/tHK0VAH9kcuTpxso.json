      "explanation": "Correct Answer: ঘ. comes from having done chores as a Kid Explanation: The original sentence: \"Success in adulthood often comes from doing chores as a Kid \" has a minor grammatical and stylistic issue: “doing chores as a Kid” is fine colloquially, but for standard English, especially formal writing, “having done chores” expresses that the action occurred in the past and is the cause of the current success. Why not the others? খ. came from doing chores as a Kid → Changes the tense incorrectly; the main verb is “comes,” so past tense “came” is inconsistent. গ. will come from chores we did as a kid → Future tense “will come” does not fit the context of “success in adulthood” which is present. ক. No change → Acceptable in casual English, but less precise than the perfect form “having done.” ঙ. comes from chores we do as a kid → Suggests ongoing action in the present, which is illogical."

Good work ethic is about taking up more than your fair share of responsibility Analysis: The passage emphasizes taking responsibility for essential duties , but it does not say you must take more than your fair share . Verdict: ❌ Not directly supported খ. Good work ethic involves taking up certain essential tasks even if these are not very likable ✅ Analysis: Matches this part of the passage: “…even when those tasks are not enjoyable or easy.” Focuses on doing necessary work despite dislike , which is exactly what the passage says. Verdict: ✅ Correct গ. Good work ethic is about striving for success despite the odds Analysis: The passage mentions perseverance in the face of challenges , but the emphasis is on doing one’s duty properly , not specifically “striving for success.” Verdict: ❌ Not directly supported ঘ. Good work ethic is about learning to like unpleasant tasks Analysis: The passage does not say you have to like the task , only that you complete it responsibly. Verdict: ❌ Not correct ঙ. None of the above Analysis: Option B already fits the passage, so this is ❌ ✅ Correct Answer: খ — Good work ethic involves taking up certain essential tasks even if these are not very likable"

      "question": "Many parents hesitate to assign chores to their children, believing that schoolwork alone is already stressful enough. They worry that adding household responsibilities will overwhelm kids or reduce their study time. However, these concerns overlook the long-term benefits that chores provide in shaping a child’s character. Chores teach children essential life skills such as time management, cooperation, and accountability. When kids learn to contribute to the family, they begin to understand the value of shared responsibility. These lessons cannot be taught through textbooks alone. Moreover, recent studies show that children who regularly participate in household tasks develop stronger problem-solving abilities as adults. They also tend to be more confident, independent, and resilient. The goal is not to burden children, but to help them grow into capable human beings who can balance multiple responsibilities. In the end, encouraging children to take part in household chores is an investment in their future. Far from being a distraction, chores play an essential role in preparing them for the real world and helping them develop a strong moral foundation. What would the passage lose if this sentence were omitted?",

      "correct": "ঘ",
      "explanation": "Correct Answer: ঘ — It would lose a major argument against teaching chores to kids The omitted sentence is: “However, these concerns overlook the long-term benefits that chores provide in shaping a child’s character.” This sentence is crucial because: 1. It directly counters the parents’ objections (the first paragraph) The passage first explains why parents hesitate. This sentence responds to those objections and shifts the passage toward the benefits of chores. Without it, the passage would jump from parents’ concerns straight to benefits without clearly addressing the concerns — weakening the logic. 2. It introduces the main argument of the passage The central idea is: Chores help children grow. This sentence is the bridge that introduces this major argument. Removing it means the passage loses the key argumentative turn that supports chores. Why the other options are wrong ক — No impact → Incorrect; removing it changes the logic. খ — Lack balance → Not about balance; it’s about argument structure. গ — Lose link to final paragraph → Not the main issue. ঙ — Less convincing → Partially true, but not the best or most specific answer. Therefore, the best answer is: ঘ — It would lose a major argument against teaching chores to kids"

      "question": "The Agricultural Revolution, which began around 10,000 years ago, marked a significant shift in human society from hunting and gathering to the domestication of plants and animals. While many scholars have portrayed this transformation as a monumental leap forward that increased human leisure and well-being, recent studies suggest that this view may be overly simplistic. In reality, the revolution brought new challenges, including increased labor demands and social inequalities. The benefits of greater leisure time for early humans remain unclear, and the full impact of agricultural practices on human societies has not been properly documented. An underlying objective of this extract is to establish that-",

      "explanation": "Passage Summary: The passage discusses the Agricultural Revolution and challenges the common perception that it was an unequivocal improvement in human life. It emphasizes that: Domestication of plants and animals may not have been entirely “monumental” or “groundbreaking” as previously claimed. Increased leisure time is not clearly shown to be a benefit. The full impact of the revolution has not been properly documented. Option Analysis ক — Greater leisure time is not beneficial for Homo Sapiens. Partially correct: The passage mentions leisure, but it does not evaluate whether it was good or bad . ❌ Cannot be inferred fully; can be ruled out . খ — Farmers had lower mortality rates. Not stated anywhere in the passage. ❌ Incorrect. গ — Domestication of plants and animals was a monumental discovery. Contradicts the passage’s message that scholars may have mischaracterized the revolution . ❌ Incorrect. ঘ — The Agricultural Revolution has not been properly documented. Supported by the passage: it explicitly says “the full impact… has not been properly documented.” ✅ Correct. ঙ — Domestication of plants and animals was not a groundbreaking phenomenon. Aligns with the passage’s critique of overstatements, but this is more interpretive . The safest, explicitly stated fact is option ঘ. ⚠ Could be partly correct, but less directly stated. Correct Answer: ঘ — The Agricultural Revolution has not been properly documented. Reason: This is the statement that is explicitly supported by the passage. Other options are either not mentioned or contradicted by the passage."

It emphasizes that: Domestication of plants and animals may not have been entirely “monumental” or “groundbreaking” as previously claimed. Increased leisure time is not clearly shown to be a benefit. The full impact of the revolution has not been properly documented. Option Analysis ক — Greater leisure time is not beneficial for Homo Sapiens. Partially correct: The passage mentions leisure, but it does not evaluate whether it was good or bad . ❌ Cannot be inferred fully; can be ruled out . খ — Farmers had lower mortality rates. Not stated anywhere in the passage. ❌ Incorrect. গ — Domestication of plants and animals was a monumental discovery. Contradicts the passage’s message that scholars may have mischaracterized the revolution . ❌ Incorrect. ঘ — The Agricultural Revolution has not been properly documented. Supported by the passage: it explicitly says “the full impact… has not been properly documented.” ✅ Correct. ঙ — Domestication of plants and animals was not a groundbreaking phenomenon. Aligns with the passage’s critique of overstatements, but this is more interpretive . The safest, explicitly stated fact is option ঘ. ⚠ Could be partly correct, but less directly stated. Correct Answer: ঘ — The Agricultural Revolution has not been properly documented. Reason: This is the statement that is explicitly supported by the passage. Other options are either not mentioned or contradicted by the passage."

This is the closest analogy : Poem → Connotation is like Artist → Genre (the work inherently carries the characteristic). খ. Mystery : Evidence ❌ Evidence solves a mystery; the relationship is cause-effect , not inherent property. গ. Childhood : Petrichor ❌ No inherent relationship; petrichor is unrelated to childhood. ঘ. Sacrilege : Morality ❌ Sacrilege violates morality; relationship is oppositional, not inherent property. ঙ. Cuisine : Piquancy ❌ Piquancy is sometimes part of cuisine, but not inherent in all cuisine — weaker analogy. ✅ Correct Answer: ক — Artist : Genre"

      "explanation": "The average of 5 distinct positive integer is 10 , so their sum must be 10 ∗ 5 = 50 10 * 5=50 10 ∗ 5 = 50 . In order to find the greatest possible value of the largest integer, we take 4 integers to be the minimum possible values. That gives us, 1, 2, 3 and 4 . So the greatest possible value for the largest number is 40 . The smallest possible value of the largest integer can be found if we take consecutive integers, keeping 10 (average) in the middle. The series is, 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 8,9,10,11,12 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 . So the smallest possible value of the greatest integer is 12. 40 − 12 = 28 40-12=28 40 − 12 = 28"

From all his students, he has found seven to be exceptionally talented, and believes that if groomed properly, they will be big stars someday. The students are Bappy, Muhit, Sabbir, Bobby, Zakir, Tonmoy, and Zofen. He plans to tutor each of them personally outside the class once a week, and has set aside an hour each day from Sunday to Thursday from his personal schedule for this purpose. But he started facing some problems while preparing the full schedule, as the students are from different classes and have different schedules of their own. He summarized the scheduling constraints as follows; Zakir's lesson must be on the day immediately before the day of Zofen's lesson. Muhit is the only student interested in clarinet, so he needs to be taught in a separate lesson. Bobby's lesson must be on an earlier day than Sabbir's lesson. Only two of the lessons can be for two students, but those two joint lessons cannot be on consecutive days. If Zubin wants to schedule the two joint lessons as early in the week as possible, and wants to tutor Zakir and Zofen as late in the week as possible, Zubin could schedule Bappy's lesson-",
