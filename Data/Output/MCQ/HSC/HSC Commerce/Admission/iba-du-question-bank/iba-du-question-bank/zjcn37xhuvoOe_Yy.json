      "question": "Instructions: Answer the Questions based on the following article. Much of the information we have today about chimpanzees comes from the groundbreaking, long-term research of the great conservationist, Jane Goodall. Jane Goodall was born in London, England, on April 3, 1934. From an early age, Jane was fascinated by animals and animal stories. By the age of 10, she was talking about going to Africa! At the time, in the early 1940s, this was a radical idea because women did not go to Africa by themselves. When in school, a friend invited her to visit Kenya. She worked as a waitress until she had earned the fare to travel there by boat. She was 23 years old. Once in Kenya, she met Dr. Louis Leakey, a famous paleontologist and anthropologist. He was impressed with her thorough knowledge of Africa and its wildlife, and hired her to assist him on a fossil- hunting expedition to Olduvai Gorge. Later, Dr. Leakey and Jane began planning a study of a group of chimpanzees who were living on the shores of Lake Tanganyika in Kenya. In July of 1960, Jane arrived at Gombe National Park in what was then called Tanganyika and is now called Tanzania. Jane expressed her interest in the idea of studying animals by living in the wild with them, rather than studying dead animals through paleontology. She had to face many challenges as she began her work. The chimpanzees did not accept her right away, and it took months for them to get used to her presence in their territory. But she was very patient and remained focused on her goal. Little by little, she was able to enter their world. At first, she was able to watch the chimpanzees only from a great distance, using binoculars. As time passed, she was able to move her observation point closer to them while still using camouflage. Eventually, she was able to sit among them, touching, patting, and even feeding them. It was an amazing accomplishment for Jane, and a breakthrough in the study of animals in the wild. Jane named all of the chimpanzees that she studied; stating in her journals that she felt they each had a unique personality. The study started by Jane Goodall in 1960 is now the longest field study of any animal species in their natural habitat. Research continues to this day in Gombe and is conducted by a team of trained Tanzanians. Synonym for the word \"camouflage\" as used in line 18 is:",

Much of the information we have today about chimpanzees comes from the groundbreaking, long-term research of the great conservationist, Jane Goodall. Jane Goodall was born in London, England, on April 3, 1934. From an early age, Jane was fascinated by animals and animal stories. By the age of 10, she was talking about going to Africa! At the time, in the early 1940s, this was a radical idea because women did not go to Africa by themselves. When in school, a friend invited her to visit Kenya. She worked as a waitress until she had earned the fare to travel there by boat. She was 23 years old. Once in Kenya, she met Dr. Louis Leakey, a famous paleontologist and anthropologist. He was impressed with her thorough knowledge of Africa and its wildlife, and hired her to assist him on a fossil- hunting expedition to Olduvai Gorge. Later, Dr. Leakey and Jane began planning a study of a group of chimpanzees who were living on the shores of Lake Tanganyika in Kenya. In July of 1960, Jane arrived at Gombe National Park in what was then called Tanganyika and is now called Tanzania. Jane expressed her interest in the idea of studying animals by living in the wild with them, rather than studying dead animals through paleontology. She had to face many challenges as she began her work. The chimpanzees did not accept her right away, and it took months for them to get used to her presence in their territory. But she was very patient and remained focused on her goal. Little by little, she was able to enter their world. At first, she was able to watch the chimpanzees only from a great distance, using binoculars. As time passed, she was able to move her observation point closer to them while still using camouflage. Eventually, she was able to sit among them, touching, patting, and even feeding them. It was an amazing accomplishment for Jane, and a breakthrough in the study of animals in the wild.
