In reality, the revolution brought new challenges, including increased labor demands and social inequalities.

Partially correct: The passage mentions leisure, but it does not evaluate whether it was good or bad . ❌ Cannot be inferred fully; can be ruled out . খ — Farmers had lower mortality rates. Not stated anywhere in the passage. ❌ Incorrect. গ — Domestication of plants and animals was a monumental discovery. Contradicts the passage’s message that scholars may have mischaracterized the revolution . ❌ Incorrect. ঘ — The Agricultural Revolution has not been properly documented. Supported by the passage: it explicitly says “the full impact… has not been properly documented.” ✅ Correct. ঙ — Domestication of plants and animals was not a groundbreaking phenomenon. Aligns with the passage’s critique of overstatements, but this is more interpretive . The safest, explicitly stated fact is option ঘ. ⚠ Could be partly correct, but less directly stated. Correct Answer: ঘ — The Agricultural Revolution has not been properly documented. Reason: This is the statement that is explicitly supported by the passage. Other options are either not mentioned or contradicted by the passage."

      "question": "Many parents hesitate to assign chores to their children, believing that schoolwork alone is already stressful enough. They worry that adding household responsibilities will overwhelm kids or reduce their study time. However, these concerns overlook the long-term benefits that chores provide in shaping a child’s character. Chores teach children essential life skills such as time management, cooperation, and accountability. When kids learn to contribute to the family, they begin to understand the value of shared responsibility. These lessons cannot be taught through textbooks alone. Moreover, recent studies show that children who regularly participate in household tasks develop stronger problem-solving abilities as adults. They also tend to be more confident, independent, and resilient. The goal is not to burden children, but to help them grow into capable human beings who can balance multiple responsibilities. In the end, encouraging children to take part in household chores is an investment in their future. Far from being a distraction, chores play an essential role in preparing them for the real world and helping them develop a strong moral foundation.

      "explanation": "Correct Answer: ঘ — It would lose a major argument against teaching chores to kids The omitted sentence is: “However, these concerns overlook the long-term benefits that chores provide in shaping a child’s character.” This sentence is crucial because: 1. It directly counters the parents’ objections (the first paragraph) The passage first explains why parents hesitate. This sentence responds to those objections and shifts the passage toward the benefits of chores. Without it, the passage would jump from parents’ concerns straight to benefits without clearly addressing the concerns — weakening the logic. 2. It introduces the main argument of the passage The central idea is: Chores help children grow. This sentence is the bridge that introduces this major argument. Removing it means the passage loses the key argumentative turn that supports chores. Why the other options are wrong ক — No impact → Incorrect; removing it changes the logic. খ — Lack balance → Not about balance; it’s about argument structure. গ — Lose link to final paragraph → Not the main issue. ঙ — Less convincing → Partially true, but not the best or most specific answer. Therefore, the best answer is: ঘ — It would lose a major argument against teaching chores to kids"

Why not the others? খ. came from doing chores as a Kid → Changes the tense incorrectly; the main verb is “comes,” so past tense “came” is inconsistent. গ. will come from chores we did as a kid → Future tense “will come” does not fit the context of “success in adulthood” which is present. ক. No change → Acceptable in casual English, but less precise than the perfect form “having done.” ঙ. comes from chores we do as a kid → Suggests ongoing action in the present, which is illogical."

Next place Nick next to Kimberly to satisfy third condition. Since condition #2, requires that either Olivia or Nick sits next to Jack and Nick is already placed at the table two seats away from Jack, place Olivia next to Jack. Condition #4, prevents Lee from sitting next to Olivia since she is already sitting next to Jack, so place Lee next to Nick to leave a space between Olivia and Lee. And finally place Melissa in the only remaining empty space. So, answer is (A) Lee and Nick"

Most educated people of the eighteenth century, such as the Founding Fathers, subscribed to Natural Rights Theory, the idea that every human being has a considerable number of innate rights, simply by virtue of being a human being when the US Constitution was sent to the states for ratification, many at that time felt that the federal government outlined by the constitution would be too strong, and that rights of individual citizens against the government had to be clarified. This led to the Bill of Right, the first ten amendments, which were ratified at he same time as the Constitution. The first eight of these amendments list specific rights of citizens. Some leaders feared that listing some rights could be interpreted to mean that citizens didn't have other, unlisted rights. Toward this end, James Madison and others produced the Ninth Amendment, which states; the fact that certain rights are listed in the Constitution shall not be construed to imply that other rights of the people are denied. Constitutional traditionalists interpret the Ninth Amendment as a rule for reading the rest of the constitution. They would argue that \"Ninth Amendment rights\" are a misconceived notion: the amendment does not, by itself, create federally enforceable rights. In particular, this strict reasoning would be opposed to the creation of any new rights based on the amendment. Rather, according to this view, the amendment merely protects those rights that citizens already have, whether they are explicitly listed in the Constitution or simply implicit in people's lives and in American tradition. More liberal interpreters of the US Constitution have a much more expansive view of the Ninth Amendment. In their view, the Ninth Amendment guarantees to American citizens a vast universe of potential rights, some of which we have enjoyed for two centuries, and others that the Founding Fathers could not possibly have conceived. These scholars point out that some rights, such as voting rights of women or minorities, were not necessarily viewed as rights by the majority of citizens in late eighteenth century America, but are taken as fundamental and unquestionable in modern America. While those rights cited are protected specifically by other amendments and laws, the argument asserts that other unlisted rights also could evolve from unthinkable to perfectly acceptable, and the Ninth Amendment would protect these as-yet-undefined rights.

      "question": "Read the following excerpt and answer the next 5 questions below: Despite a long-term decline in the circus industry, Cirque du Soleil profitably increased revenue 22-fold over the last ten years by reinventing the circus. Rather than competing within the confines of the existing industry or trying to steal customers from rivals, Cirque developed uncontested market space that made the competition irrelevant. Cirque created what is called a blue ocean, a previously unknown market space. In blue oceans, demand is created rather than fought over. There is ample opportunity for growth that is both profitable and rapid. In red oceans existing companies in the industry compete to grab a greater share of limited demand. As the market space gets more crowded, prospects for profits and growth decline. Products turn into commodities, and increasing competition turns the water bloody. There are two ways to create blue oceans. One is to launch completely new industries, as eBay did with online auctions. But it's much more common for a blue ocean to be created from within a red ocean when a company expands the boundaries of an existing industry. A blue ocean strategy encourages companies to focus less on their competitors and more on alternatives, while at the same time focusing less on their current customers and more on potential new customers. While competitive strategy would advise companies to enter attractive industries and avoid unattractive ones, blue oceans can be created in any industries, be they attractive or unattractive, stagnant or fast growing, high tech or low tech. It is all about creating new market space rather than letting the existing market structure confine strategic choices. Creating blue oceans builds brands. Along with Cirque, Southwest Airlines offers an example of successful blue ocean strategy execution. Southwest tapped into a customer base who preferred driving to air travel due to the lower cost. Instead of competing with other airlines, Southwest positioned itself as an alternative to cars and offered reduced prices, improved check-in times and increased flight frequency. Winners in a blue ocean strategy like Southwest, use 'value innovation' to drive their strategy. However, a blue ocean strategy is inherently disruptive and that makes it far riskier than a red ocean strategy. The primary purpose of the passage is to:",

      "explanation": "We know that the absolute (পরম মান) of a fraction (ভগ্নাংশ) depends on the difference of value of the numerator and the denominator. If the value of the numerator is smaller than the denominator, then the fraction will have a value that will be less than 1, and if the value of the numerator is greater than the value of the denominator, then the value of the fraction will be greater than 1. This concept can be applied to this problem. X represents the ratio of work-speed of P and R, which is, X=P/R. Y represents the ratio of work-speed of Q and R, which is, Y=Q/R. Given that, X<Y and Y<1, therefore, the value of both X and Y are less than 1 and greater than 0, since working speed cannot be negative. Since in both the fractions, the value is less than 1 and they have the common denominator R, we can say that the work speed of R is clearly greater than that of P or Q."

Case 1: The ticket was bought 5 days in advance and price would increase if it was bought one day later i.e., 4 days in advance. This means Tk 252 is the price after 15\\% discount and Tk 306 is the total price of the ticket. But if we calculate we will find that after applying 15 % 15 \\% 15% discount on Tk 306 the amount is not Tk 252. So, the ticket was not bought 5 days in advance. Case 2: The ticket was bought 30 days in advance and price would increase if it was bought one day later i.e., 29 days in advance. This means Tk 252 is the price after 30 % 30 \\% 30% discount and Tk 306 is the price after 15 % 15 \\% 15% discount. If we find the total price from both of these amounts then we can see that the total price is same i.e., Tk 360 for both amounts. So, the ticket was actually bought 30 days in advance. Case 3: The ticket was bought 60 days in advance and price would increase if it was bought one day later i.e., 59 days in advance. No need to check, since answer already found."

Then, quantity of mango juice left in the container after 4 operations = x × ( 1 − =\\mathrm{x} \\times(1- = x × ( 1 − 8 / x ) 4 8 / x)^{4} 8/ x ) 4 litres So, ratio of quantity of remaining mango juice to initial quantity of mango juice is: x × ( 1 − 8 x ) 4 x = ( 1 − 8 x ) 4 \\frac{x \\times\\left(1-\\frac{8}{x}\\right)^{4}}{x}=\\left(1-\\frac{8}{x}\\right)^{4} x x × ( 1 − x 8 ​ ) 4 ​ = ( 1 − x 8 ​ ) 4 According to the question, this ratio equals 16 / 81 16 / 81 16/81 .

The phrase “a prior reason” is awkward here. Normally, you would say “no reason” or “no prior reason” , but adding “a” makes it grammatically wrong. Sentence iii: \"The patient, priorly known for his delusional tendencies, was admitted right away.\" ✅ Correct. “Priorly” is the adverb form of prior and is used correctly to modify known .

Any red sheet ⇒ at least one orange sheet. So, red and orange must appear together if either is included. Blue and purple sheets cannot be together. ❌ Green → Purple dependency: Any green sheet ⇒ at least one purple sheet. Purple sheet does not require green. Now, the question asks: “An acceptable package CANNOT contain two sheets of–” We need to check which color cannot have two sheets in the same package . Red & Orange: Must appear together if included, but nothing prohibits having two reds or two oranges . ✅ Possible. Blue & Purple: Cannot be together; two of the same color is not prohibited. ✅ Possible. Green & Purple: Green requires purple, but nothing prohibits two greens . ✅ Possible. The trick is with orange and red : since red ↔ orange dependency exists, having two oranges but no red would violate the rule. Similarly, two reds but no orange would also violate the rule. Thus, you cannot have two sheets of Orange or Red alone . ✅ The best answer from the options is: ক – Orange ."

All the people of Bangladesh are very excited and eagerly waiting to watch the match.

Each arena has a group of three adjacent seats. In this circumstance, they have to divide themselves into three groups but that is not so easy as they have certain reservations that must be followed while forming the groups. A funny constraint is that no sophomores can be together in any group and so are any seniors. Not only that, Wajhat in his very first day at university had an unfortunate mishap with Rakshan and thereupon he is not in a position to be in the same group of Rakshan. Last but not the least, Xanbi, being a bit obstinate, constraints herself to be in a group with Salsabil or Udvash or both.

National character is not formally considered by social scientists in discussing economic and social development today. They believe that people differ, and that these difference should be taken into account somehow, but they have as yet discovered no way to include such variables in their formal models of economic and social development. The difficulty lies in the nature of the data that supposedly define different national characteristics. Anthropologists and others are on much firmer ground when they attempt to describe the cultural norms for a small homogeneous tribe or village than when they undertake the formidable task of discovering the norms that exist in a complex modern nation-state composed of many disparate groups. The situation is further complicated by the nature of judgments about characters since such judgments are overly dependent on impressions, and since, furthermore, impressions are usually stated in qualitative terms, it is impossible to make a reliable comparison between the national characters of two countries. It can be inferred from the passage that the social scientists mentioned in lines 1-4 would agree with which of the following statements? I. It is extremely difficult to create models that account for both economic and social development. II. Models of economic and social development would be improved by the inclusion of adequate descriptions of national character. III.

National character is not formally considered by social scientists in discussing economic and social development today. They believe that people differ, and that these difference should be taken into account somehow, but they have as yet discovered no way to include such variables in their formal models of economic and social development. The difficulty lies in the nature of the data that supposedly define different national characteristics. Anthropologists and others are on much firmer ground when they attempt to describe the cultural norms for a small homogeneous tribe or village than when they undertake the formidable task of discovering the norms that exist in a complex modern nation-state composed of many disparate groups. The situation is further complicated by the nature of judgments about characters since such judgments are overly dependent on impressions, and since, furthermore, impressions are usually stated in qualitative terms, it is impossible to make a reliable comparison between the national characters of two countries. Which of the following best describes the organization of the passage?",

      "question": "Read the following passage and select the best answer for each of the questions that follow. Analyzing the physics of dance can add fundamentally to a dancer's skill. Although dancers see themselves totally in physical terms as body mass moving through space under the influence of well- known forces and obeying physical laws - neither can they afford to ignore the physics of movement. For example, no matter how much a dancer wishes to leap off the floor and then start turning the law of conservation of angular momentum absolutely prevents such a movement. Some movements involving primarily vertical or horizontal motions of the body as a whole, in which rotations can be ignored, can be studied using simple equations of linear motions in three dimensions. However, rotational motions require more complex approaches that involve analyses of the. way the body's mass is distributed, the axes of rotation involved in different types of movement, and the sources of the forces that produce the rotational movement. Analyses of which of the following would require the kind of complex approach described in the lines -10?",

The Earth's magnetic field is generated as the molten iron of the Earth's outer core revolves around its solid inner core. When surges in the molten iron occur, magnetic tempests are created.

Step 1: Break down the EPL watchers Total EPL watchers = 204 Among them, students who do NOT watch IPL = 97 So: Both=204−97=107\\text{Both} = 204 - 97 = 107Both=204−97=107 Step 2: Verify consistency with total group To check correctness: EPL only = 97 Both = 107 So IPL only = 281 − (97 + 107) =281−204=77= 281 - 204 = 77=281−204=77 All numbers are valid (none negative). Total IPL watchers = IPL only + Both = 77 + 107 = 184 (reasonable). So the question is correct and consistent. Correct Answer: 107 students watch both.

Limiting out other potential factors that could repeal mosquitoes. If other insect species are not repelled by DS then it is possible that DS is responsible for mosquito repeals. Let's take the opposite of this answer choice - If many other insect species were also not found in the fields this particular year - this would mean that some other factor such as maybe extreme environment or poor water quality could result in insect species getting repelled (including mosquitoes). That's why correct answer is D."

The author then prefaces the argument with, \"If this were the only rule one followed..\" (And that rule is, \"never change that set, except by rejecting a belief when given adequate evidence against it.\"). Therefore, the author's argument is only concerned with what would happen if that were the only rule one followed (i.e. if one were to only remove beliefs and never add new beliefs). If someone were to \"accept new beliefs when presented with some kinds of evidence\" (as stated in choice B), then that person would NOT be adhering only to that rule (since they would be ADDING to the set of beliefs).

      "explanation": "'Mimic the reasoning' questions are a bit harder than others. You first need to figure out the reasoning of the argument and then try to figure out the logic used in each of the options. It helps to put the logic in A and B format. Jordan: If a business invests the money necessary to implement ecologically sound practices, its market share will decrease. But if it doesn't implement these practices, it pollutes the environment and wastes resources. Jordan: If A does X, something bad will happen to A. If A doesn't do X, something bad will happen to B. Terry: But if consumers demand environmental responsibility of all businesses, no particular business will be especially hurt. Terry: If C does D, A doing X will not be bad. Now this is the logic used by the argument: Jordan: If A does X, something bad will happen to A. If A doesn't do X, something bad will happen to B. Terry: If C does Y, A doing X will not be bad. (A) Jordan: Either it will rain and our plans for a picnic will be thwarted, or it won't rain and the garden will go yet another day without much-needed watering. Terry: But if it doesn't rain, we can buy a hose and water the garden with the hose. Jordan: If it rains, something bad will happen to us. If it doesn't rain something bad will happen to garden. Terry: If we do X, raining will not be bad. That logic does parallel our original logic. (B) Jordan: Each person can have either an enjoyable life or a long life, for one must eat vegetables and exercise continuously to stay healthy. Terry: That's not true: there are many happy health- conscious people. Jordan: One can get only one thing at a time A or B. Terry: No, both can be had together. (C) Jordan: If taxes are raised, many social problems could be solved, but if they're lowered, the economy will grow again. So, we can't have both social reform and a growing economy. Terry: But if taxes remain at their current level, neither social problems nor the economy will get worse. Jordan: If A does X, good things will happen. If A does opposite of X, other good things will happen. So, both good things cannot happen simultaneously. Terry: If nothing is done, no bad thing will happen. (D) Jordan: If we remodel the kitchen, the house will be more valuable, but even if we do, there's no guarantee that we'll actually get more for the house when we sell it. Terry: But if we don't remodel the kitchen, we might get even less for the house than we paid for it. Jordan: If we do X, a good thing will happen but no guarantee about another good thing. Terry: If we do not do X, a bad thing may happen. (E) Jordan: If the dam's spillway is opened, the river might flood the eastern part of town, but if the spillway is not opened, the dam might burst. Terry: There's no real danger of the dam's bursting, but if we get more heavy rain, opening the spillway is the most prudent policy. Jordan: If X happens, a bad thing may happen but if X doesn't happen, another bad thing may happen. Terry: Chances of the other bad thing are low. Doing X may be most prudent. Hence the correct answer is A."

But if we combine both of the statements then we get that the number must be divisible by both 6 and 8. That means the number is the LCM, 24 or a factor of 24 which is always divisible by 12. That's why the answer is C."

(1) sc 245000 (2) s = 1.25(225000) Statement (1) is sufficient, because when you combine the 'fact' in the question with that statement, you have a system of two linear equations and you can solve.

Now, again consider, a/b < c/d ---> d/b < cla ---> (d/b) + 1 < (c/a) + 1 ---> (d+b)/b< (c+a)/a --> a/b < (c+a)/(b+d) but this is not what statement II mentions, making statement II false. Finally, for (a+c)/(b+d) = a/b + c/d, you can clearly prove this wrong by taking a,b,c,d as 1,2,3,4. Because, 1 2 < 3 4 \\frac{1}{2}<\\frac{3}{4} 2 1 ​ < 4 3 ​ LHS, for ( a + c ) / ( b + d ) = 1 + 3 2 + 4 = 2 3 (a+c) /(b+d)=\\frac{1+3}{2+4}=\\frac{2}{3} ( a + c ) / ( b + d ) = 2 + 4 1 + 3 ​ = 3 2 ​ RHS, for a / b + c / d = , 1 2 + 3 4 = 5 4 \\mathrm{a} / \\mathrm{b}+\\mathrm{c} / \\mathrm{d}=, \\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{3}{4}=\\frac{5}{4} a / b + c / d = , 2 1 ​ + 4 3 ​ = 4 5 ​ So this is also not true. For a MUST BE TRUE question, you need to get a yes ALWAYS. Thus, only statement I is true , making B the correct answer."

      "explanation": "Let's say the width of the border is x. It is given the area of the bordered region is 144 square inches It is given that the length of the photograph is 10 inches and the breadth of the photograph is 8 inches. So, the area of the photograph will be equal to the product of length and breadth, i.e., 10 × 8 10 \\times 8 10 × 8 which will be equal to 80 squareinches. If we need to find the area of the photograph with border, then we have add 2 x 2 x 2 x in the length and breadth of the photograph, because the width has to be considered for both sides. So, the length of the photograph with the border will be 10 + 2 x 10+2 x 10 + 2 x and the breadth of the photograph with the border will be 8 + 2 x 8+2 x 8 + 2 x Therefore, the area of photograph with border will be product of length and breadth, i.e., ( 10 + 2 x ) ( 8 + 2 x ) (10+2 x)(8+2 x) ( 10 + 2 x ) ( 8 + 2 x ) which will be equal to ( 10 + 2 x ) ( 8 + 2 x ) = 80 + 20 x + 16 x + 4 x 2 = 4 x 2 + 36 x + 80 (10+2 x)(8+2 x)=80+20 x+16 x+4 x^{2}=4 x^{2}+36 x+80 ( 10 + 2 x ) ( 8 + 2 x ) = 80 + 20 x + 16 x + 4 x 2 = 4 x 2 + 36 x + 80 Again, it is given in the question that the area of the border is 144 square inches. To find the area of the border we need to subtract the area of the photograph with a photograph with border. Therefore, Area of photograph with border - Area of photograph = 144 =144 = 144 Now, 4 x 2 + 36 x + 80 − 80 = 144 4 x^{2}+36 x+80-80=144 4 x 2 + 36 x + 80 − 80 = 144 Which gives us x = 3 \\mathrm{x}=3 x = 3"

      "question": "During the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Communist Party in many countries adopted a strategy known as the Third Period , characterized by a highly radical stance. Party leaders emphasized the imminent collapse of capitalism and the need for an immediate workers’ revolution. They were often critical of social democrats and liberal organizations, labeling them as obstacles to true socialist transformation. By the mid-1930s, however, the global political context shifted with the rise of fascism in Europe. In response, Communist Parties adopted the Popular Front strategy, seeking alliances with a broader spectrum of political and social groups, including liberals, trade unionists, and anti-fascist organizations. The focus during the Popular Front era was less on immediate revolutionary action and more on building coalitions, gradual reforms, and united resistance against fascist threats. The contrast between the Third Period and the Popular Front illustrates how political strategies may shift dramatically in response to changing social and international conditions, from radical confrontation to cooperative engagement. Based on the passage, which one of the following statements is more likely to have been made by a Communist Party organizer during the Third Period than during the Popular Front?",

Much of the information we have today about chimpanzees comes from the groundbreaking, long-term research of the great conservationist, Jane Goodall. Jane Goodall was born in London, England, on April 3, 1934. From an early age, Jane was fascinated by animals and animal stories. By the age of 10, she was talking about going to Africa! At the time, in the early 1940s, this was a radical idea because women did not go to Africa by themselves. When in school, a friend invited her to visit Kenya. She worked as a waitress until she had earned the fare to travel there by boat. She was 23 years old. Once in Kenya, she met Dr. Louis Leakey, a famous paleontologist and anthropologist. He was impressed with her thorough knowledge of Africa and its wildlife, and hired her to assist him on a fossil- hunting expedition to Olduvai Gorge. Later, Dr. Leakey and Jane began planning a study of a group of chimpanzees who were living on the shores of Lake Tanganyika in Kenya. In July of 1960, Jane arrived at Gombe National Park in what was then called Tanganyika and is now called Tanzania. Jane expressed her interest in the idea of studying animals by living in the wild with them, rather than studying dead animals through paleontology. She had to face many challenges as she began her work. The chimpanzees did not accept her right away, and it took months for them to get used to her presence in their territory. But she was very patient and remained focused on her goal. Little by little, she was able to enter their world. At first, she was able to watch the chimpanzees only from a great distance, using binoculars. As time passed, she was able to move her observation point closer to them while still using camouflage. Eventually, she was able to sit among them, touching, patting, and even feeding them. It was an amazing accomplishment for Jane, and a breakthrough in the study of animals in the wild. Jane named all of the chimpanzees that she studied; stating in her journals that she felt they each had a unique personality.

      "question": "Instructions: Answer the Questions based on the following article. Much of the information we have today about chimpanzees comes from the groundbreaking, long-term research of the great conservationist, Jane Goodall. Jane Goodall was born in London, England, on April 3, 1934. From an early age, Jane was fascinated by animals and animal stories. By the age of 10, she was talking about going to Africa! At the time, in the early 1940s, this was a radical idea because women did not go to Africa by themselves. When in school, a friend invited her to visit Kenya. She worked as a waitress until she had earned the fare to travel there by boat. She was 23 years old. Once in Kenya, she met Dr. Louis Leakey, a famous paleontologist and anthropologist. He was impressed with her thorough knowledge of Africa and its wildlife, and hired her to assist him on a fossil- hunting expedition to Olduvai Gorge. Later, Dr. Leakey and Jane began planning a study of a group of chimpanzees who were living on the shores of Lake Tanganyika in Kenya. In July of 1960, Jane arrived at Gombe National Park in what was then called Tanganyika and is now called Tanzania. Jane expressed her interest in the idea of studying animals by living in the wild with them, rather than studying dead animals through paleontology. She had to face many challenges as she began her work. The chimpanzees did not accept her right away, and it took months for them to get used to her presence in their territory. But she was very patient and remained focused on her goal. Little by little, she was able to enter their world. At first, she was able to watch the chimpanzees only from a great distance, using binoculars. As time passed, she was able to move her observation point closer to them while still using camouflage. Eventually, she was able to sit among them, touching, patting, and even feeding them. It was an amazing accomplishment for Jane, and a breakthrough in the study of animals in the wild. Jane named all of the chimpanzees that she studied; stating in her journals that she felt they each had a unique personality. The study started by Jane Goodall in 1960 is now the longest field study of any animal species in their natural habitat. Research continues to this day in Gombe and is conducted by a team of trained Tanzanians. What mainly made Jane's work different from those of others is:",

Blue & Purple: Cannot be together; two of the same color is not prohibited. ✅ Possible. Green & Purple: Green requires purple, but nothing prohibits two greens . ✅ Possible. The trick is with orange and red : since red ↔ orange dependency exists, having two oranges but no red would violate the rule. Similarly, two reds but no orange would also violate the rule.

Therefore, the author's argument is only concerned with what would happen if that were the only rule one followed (i.e. if one were to only remove beliefs and never add new beliefs). If someone were to \"accept new beliefs when presented with some kinds of evidence\" (as stated in choice B), then that person would NOT be adhering only to that rule (since they would be ADDING to the set of beliefs).

For example, no matter how much a dancer wishes to leap off the floor and then start turning the law of conservation of angular momentum absolutely prevents such a movement. Some movements involving primarily vertical or horizontal motions of the body as a whole, in which rotations can be ignored, can be studied using simple equations of linear motions in three dimensions.

Let's take the opposite of this answer choice - If many other insect species were also not found in the fields this particular year - this would mean that some other factor such as maybe extreme environment or poor water quality could result in insect species getting repelled (including mosquitoes).

National character is not formally considered by social scientists in discussing economic and social development today.

The difficulty lies in the nature of the data that supposedly define different national characteristics. Anthropologists and others are on much firmer ground when they attempt to describe the cultural norms for a small homogeneous tribe or village than when they undertake the formidable task of discovering the norms that exist in a complex modern nation-state composed of many disparate groups.

      "explanation": "'Mimic the reasoning' questions are a bit harder than others. You first need to figure out the reasoning of the argument and then try to figure out the logic used in each of the options. It helps to put the logic in A and B format. Jordan: If a business invests the money necessary to implement ecologically sound practices, its market share will decrease. But if it doesn't implement these practices, it pollutes the environment and wastes resources. Jordan: If A does X, something bad will happen to A. If A doesn't do X, something bad will happen to B. Terry: But if consumers demand environmental responsibility of all businesses, no particular business will be especially hurt. Terry: If C does D, A doing X will not be bad. Now this is the logic used by the argument: Jordan: If A does X, something bad will happen to A. If A doesn't do X, something bad will happen to B. Terry: If C does Y, A doing X will not be bad. (A) Jordan: Either it will rain and our plans for a picnic will be thwarted, or it won't rain and the garden will go yet another day without much-needed watering. Terry: But if it doesn't rain, we can buy a hose and water the garden with the hose. Jordan: If it rains, something bad will happen to us. If it doesn't rain something bad will happen to garden. Terry: If we do X, raining will not be bad. That logic does parallel our original logic. (B) Jordan: Each person can have either an enjoyable life or a long life, for one must eat vegetables and exercise continuously to stay healthy. Terry: That's not true: there are many happy health- conscious people. Jordan: One can get only one thing at a time A or B. Terry: No, both can be had together. (C) Jordan: If taxes are raised, many social problems could be solved, but if they're lowered, the economy will grow again. So, we can't have both social reform and a growing economy. Terry: But if taxes remain at their current level, neither social problems nor the economy will get worse. Jordan: If A does X, good things will happen. If A does opposite of X, other good things will happen. So, both good things cannot happen simultaneously. Terry: If nothing is done, no bad thing will happen. (D) Jordan: If we remodel the kitchen, the house will be more valuable, but even if we do, there's no guarantee that we'll actually get more for the house when we sell it. Terry: But if we don't remodel the kitchen, we might get even less for the house than we paid for it. Jordan: If we do X, a good thing will happen but no guarantee about another good thing. Terry: If we do not do X, a bad thing may happen. (E) Jordan: If the dam's spillway is opened, the river might flood the eastern part of town, but if the spillway is not opened, the dam might burst. Terry: There's no real danger of the dam's bursting, but if we get more heavy rain, opening the spillway is the most prudent policy. Jordan: If X happens, a bad thing may happen but if X doesn't happen, another bad thing may happen. Terry: Chances of the other bad thing are low. Doing X may be most prudent. Hence the correct answer is A."

Taking both statements together: x + y x − y > 1 \\frac{x+y}{x-y}>1 x − y x + y ​ > 1 Or, x + y > 1 / 3 x+y>1 / 3 x + y > 1/3 Here, y y y is positive. This means that x x x might be a negative number such that, x + y > 1 / 3 x+y>1 / 3 x + y > 1/3 . So, both statements together are not sufficient. Correct Answer (E)"
