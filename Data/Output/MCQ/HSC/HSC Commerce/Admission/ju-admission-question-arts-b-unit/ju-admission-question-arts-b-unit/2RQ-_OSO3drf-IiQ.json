      "correct": "খ",
      "explanation": "Certainly! Let's go through the transformation from active voice to passive voice with the relevant rules: Original Sentence: \"The burglar destroyed several items in the room. Even the carpet has been torn.\" Correct Passive Transformation: \"Several items in the room were destroyed by the burglar. Even the carpet was torn.\" Explanation: 1. Identifying the Agent (Subject): - In the passive voice, the object of the active voice becomes the subject, and the agent (doer of the action) is introduced with \"by.\" - Example: \"The burglar\" is the agent in this sentence. 2. Changing the Verb: - The main verb in the active voice becomes the past participle in the passive voice. - Example: \"destroyed\" becomes \"were destroyed,\" and \"has been torn\" becomes \"was torn.\" 3. Maintaining the Object: - The object in the active voice becomes the subject in the passive voice. - Example: \"Several items in the room\" remains the subject in the passive voice. 4. Adjusting the Additional Information: - Additional information, such as \"Even the carpet,\" is retained in a similar position in the passive voice. - Example: \"Even the carpet was torn.\" Rules Applied: - In passive voice transformations, maintain the original object as the new subject and introduce the agent with \"by.\" - Adjust the verb form to the past participle. - Retain additional information in a similar position. Analysis of Other Options: - ক: \"Several items destroyed in the room by the burglar. Even the carpet he has torn.\" - This option has a mixed structure and is not a proper passive voice transformation. - গ: \"Inclucding the carpet, several items in the room have been torn by the burgar.\" - This option contains errors such as misspelling \"Including\" and a mixed structure. In summary, option খ adheres to the rules of passive voice transformation by correctly identifying the agent, adjusting the verb forms, and maintaining the object in its new subject position."

      "explanation": "The captain left the boat- ক্যাপটেইন নৌকাটি ত্যাগ করেছিল কারণ এটি উল্টে গিয়েছিল। The captain left the boat because it turned over. Explanation: Turned over: In the context of a boat, \"turned over\" refers to the boat capsizing or flipping upside down. This situation can be dangerous, and the captain likely left the boat to ensure safety. Now, let's briefly explore the other options: Turned down: This typically means rejecting an offer or reducing something in intensity. It doesn't fit the context of a boat situation. Turned bottom: This phrase is not commonly used, and it doesn't convey a clear meaning in this context. Turned up: While it can mean to appear or arrive, it doesn't convey the idea of why the captain would leave the boat. So, the correct explanation is that the captain left the boat because it \"turned over,\" indicating a capsizing or flipping of the boat."

      "question": "Read the passage and answer to the questions: While adolescence is a time of tremendous growth and potential, it is a time tremendous risks during which social contexts exert powerful influences. Many adolescents face pressure to use themselves at high risk for intentional and unintentional injuries, unintended pregnancies, and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Many also experience a wide range of adjustment and mental health problems. Behavior patterns that are established during this period such as the use or avoidance of drugs and taking or abstaining from sexual risk can have long-lasting negative and positive effects on future health and well-being. As a result, adults have unique opportunities to influence adolescents. Adolescents are different both from young children and adults. Specifically, adolescents are not fully capable of understanding complex concepts, or, the relationship between behavior and consequences, or the degree of control they have or can have over health decision-marking, including that related to sexual behaviors. Laws, customs, and practices may also affect adolescents differently when they are unnamed. In addition even when services do exist, provider attitudes abut adolescents often pose a significant border to the use of those services, Adolescents depend on their families, their communities schools, health services and their workplaces to learn a wide range of skills that can help them to cope with the pressures they fsce and make a successful transition from childhood to adulthood. Patent, members of the community, service providers, and social institutions have the responsibility to both promote adolescent development and adjustment and to intervene effective when problems arise. 19.1.
