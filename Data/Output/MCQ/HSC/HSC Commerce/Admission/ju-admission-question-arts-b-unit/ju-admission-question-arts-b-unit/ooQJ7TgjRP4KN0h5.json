      "explanation": "Certainly! Let's break down the options and provide an explanation: - ক. allusive: - This term means having a reference or hinting at something without directly stating it. In the context of the sentence, it doesn't convey the idea that Rajiv's answers were directly related or relevant to the questions asked. - খ. revealing: - This term means making something known or disclosing information. While it implies providing information, it doesn't specifically convey the idea of relevance or appropriateness to the questions. - গ. referential: - This term means containing or making reference to something. While it suggests a connection, it may not necessarily convey the sense of direct relevance or appropriateness to the questions. - ঘ. pertinent: - This term means relevant or applicable to a particular matter. In the context of the sentence, \"Rajiv failed because his answers were not pertinent to the questions asked\" indicates that Rajiv's answers were not directly related or suitable for the questions, leading to his failure. Therefore, \"pertinent\" is the most appropriate choice as it best conveys the idea of Rajiv's answers lacking relevance to the questions asked."
